1,"The many characters in ""Thirteen Conversations About One Thing"" striveevery second of their waking lives to be happy. After all, isn't thatthe major goal that we are constantly striving to reach? Like life,it doesn't always turn out that way. Those that deserve contentmentdon't always find it, and those that don't, do. Through the powerof their own actions and the unavoidable hands of fate, each characterfinds their personal outlook shattered or mended by the time the endcredits roll. And life goes on. With ""Thirteen Conversations About One Thing,"" director Jill Sprecherand screenwriting sister Karen Sprecher (whose 1997 workplace slice-of-life""Clockwatchers"" was a small gem) have concocted one of the most emphaticand thought-provoking motion pictures of the year. Expertly weavingback and forth between four central storylines taking place in NewYork City over the span of a year, the film is told out of chronologicalorder not as a gimmick, but as a means of deepening the relationshipsbetween these veritable strangers who may or may not realize the pivotaleffect they have on each other's lives. The picture begins as defense attorney Troy (Matthew McConaughey),who proudly believes in the justice set by the judicial system, iscelebrating his latest court win at a local bar. After one too manydrinks, he sets off for home, only to hit someone in the road. Ina moment of foolish haste and fear, he goes against everything hebelieves in and leaves the scene of the crime. With pangs of unbearableguilt, he begins to change the way he previously has lived his lifeand, as a reminder of his crime, keeps a head wound he sustained fromthe accident open with a razor blade. Walker (John Turturro) is a college professor in such desperationto find happiness in any way possible that he has begun an affairwith a colleague (Barbara Sukowa) behind his wife's (Amy Irving) back.What he fails to realize before it's too late is that his wife, Patricia,has known about it for quite some time, and is biding her time beforethe inevitable breakup of their marriage. Meanwhile, Beatrice (Clea DuVall) is a humble housekeeper so completelyblissful with her place in life that her more cynical friend and coworker,Dorrie (Tia Texada), looks up to her with admiration and hope forthe future. Even after Beatrice is hit by a car and narrowly escapesdeath, she views the occurrence as a sign that she was meant to remainon the Earth for some reason. Beatrice's outlook drastically changesand her indomitable spirit plummets, however, when she finds herselfbeing falsely accused by a client of theft. Finally, Gene (Alan Arkin) is a mid-level manager at an insurancecompany so disgruntled with his life that, when asked to downsizethe company to save money, decides to lay off his most joyful anduplifting worker (William Wise) in an attempt to emotionally ruinhim. What Gene doesn't realize is that, for all of the problems heis having (he is separated from his wife and has a drug-addicted son),they are about to get much worse. A film that pulses with empathy toward its imperfect characters, ""ThirteenConversations About One Thing"" captures the resourcefulness and fragilityof human nature with a consistently sharp eye that proves truly mesmerizing.A true conversation-starter, the movie leaves such an impact by itsconclusion that to walk out and not be thinking of one's own choices,and the eventual repercussions they caused, is to completely havemissed the point of what Jill and Karen Sprecher want us to take away from it all.  One of the many aspects of the film the Sprecher sisters have accomplishedwith exquisite accuracy is in introducing an ensemble of people, bothin large and minor roles, who all have lives outside of the scenesthey are captured in. In the course of the film, each is forced tomake a number of decisions that may forever alter their own, and otherpeople's, futures. The human beings filling each frame do not seemlike characters as much as real-life people gradually imploding asthey realize what little control they have in the outcomes of their every move. The performances are superlative across the board. Alan Arkin (2001's""America's Sweethearts""), as the almost cluelessly vengeful Gene,has what is arguably the most developed and subtly challenging role,and his stupendous work is Oscar-worthy. The same could be said forClea DuVall (1999's ""Girl, Interrupted""), as Beatrice, whose drasticchange from a wide-eyed optimist to a broken-down pessimist is genuinelyheartbreaking. Matthew McConaughey (2002's ""Frailty"") hits every keywith perfection as his character of Troy travels on a downward spiralto feelings of true reprehensibility. Rounding out the central fourplayers, John Turturro (2002's ""Mr. Deeds"") displays effective dosesof self-involvement and loneliness as the comfortable life he oncehad drifts off into the distance. The ultra-fine acting turns do not stop there. Amy Irving (2000's""Traffic""), in the strongest part she has had in years, finds strengthin her character of Patricia, who discovers her husband's infidelityand is surprised to find how easily she accepts it. As a troubledstudent in Walker's class who looks for hopeful guidance in his teacherand only finds brutal anthropy, Rob McElhenney's (2000's ""Wonder Boys"")pivotal bearing on Walker's section of the film is downright haunting.Tia Texada (2000's ""Nurse Betty"") also creates an unforgettable characterin Dorrie, who loses faith in anything good happening in her lifewhen Beatrice alarmingly changes her own attitude. ""Thirteen Conversations About One Thing"" is a startling ruminationon life that avoids pretentiousness by playing out its hand with anunflinching reality to the people it is about. So involving, and sounshakably honest, are its themes and ideas that it is a shame itdoesn't run another half-hour, which could have fleshed out the characterseven more. The final scene, which involves two strangers--both peoplewe have become deeply attached to through the course of the film--findingpersonal solace in a moment of mutual recognition, is brilliant. ""ThirteenConversations About One Things"" is, at once, reassuring and disheartening,remarkably powerful and earnestly genuine. We, as human beings, areall in the same boat, director Jill Sprecher so passionately wantsus to know, and the only way to truly find happiness is to press onwith life in the best way we know how, thankful that those aroundus are just as flawed as we.",13 Conversations About One Thing,R,2002,3
2,"        For more than two years, this cliche-ridden action adventurehas gathered dust on the shelf at Disney's Buena Vista Pictures. Noone knew quite when to release it or how to market its blood 'n' gutscontent to the public. Antonio Banderas (""The Mask of Zorro"") playsAhmed Ibn Fahdlan, an urbane Muslim poet-diplomat banished from hisEgyptian homeland during the 10th century, along with elderly OmarSharif, who acts as his translator.  Fleeing from Baghdad in a caravanafter Banderas has indulged in a foolish sexual liaison, they join upwith some growling, swaggering, blond Nordic warriors with names likeHelfdane the Large (Clive Russell), Skeld the Superstitious (RichardBremmer), and Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhoi), amongothers. They're led by Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich) on a quest toliberate a kingdom across the sea from a mysterious, marauding tribeof bear-like savages who have been terrorizing everyone - at leastwhen it gets foggy. (They filmed it in British Columbia where themists obviously rise on cue.) Based on Michael Crichton's 1976 novel,""Eaters of the Dead,"" it combines rowdy, swashbuckling brutality witha hint of the supernatural as they pursue the ferocious ""terror thatmust not be named."" Director John McTiernan did this long before ""TheHunt for Red October"" and he would be wise to leave it off hisresume. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""The 13th Warrior"" is aridiculously bloodthirsty 3, proving grisly gore has no limits. ","13th Warrior, The",R,1999,0.5
3,"In today's day and age, when it seems like a progressive amount of people are committing extreme criminal acts in order to, at least in part, become famous (i.e. last week's San Diego high school shooting), writer-director John Herzfeld's ""15 Minutes"" stands as a timely, thoughtful motion picture. Taking a satirical, if on-the-mark, look at the outrageous lengths some people will go to get their fifteen minutes of fame (a term coined by Andy Warhol), as well as their learned savviness thanks to the media around them, the film is an intense, well-written thriller that, for once, has more of a purpose than to simply entertain. It actually has a brain in its head, and a sharply observed '70s-era sensibility that recalls such classic films as ""The Parallax View,"" ""The French Connection,"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon.""  The second that the scummy Czech immigrant Emil (Karel Roden) and Russian movie-lover Oleg (Oleg Taktarov) step foot into America, hell starts to break loose. Equipped with a snazzy video camera that Oleg steals, he and Emil set out on a precisely-planned, murderous rampage throughout Manhattan that includes stabbings, beatings, shootings, and arson to anyone they feel like doing it to. Their purpose is very simple: to commit enough murders to catapult them to the top of every media outlet in the world, intentionally get caught, plead that they were the subjects of physical abuse growing up, get acquitted, and reap in loads of money on movie and book deals.  After a fatal building fire, arson investigator Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) meets famed homicide detective Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro), who has been assigned to the case. They soon team up together to investigate the string of killings that have begun to escalate in the city, with Eddie not knowing Oleg and Emil already are familiar with his celebrity, and have plans of their own for him.  Always involving and often exciting and downright unsettling, ""15 Minutes"" is a bravura police/media drama that has been written and directed by John Herzfeld (1996's ""2 Days in the Valley"") with a clear precision that offers up more than the usual glossy, mainstream grab-bag of senseless action and pointless violence. The picture is clever and knowing in its attitudes about violence in the U.S., and the effects their outcome have on the criminals themselves. It also has plot developments that, for once, are not easily predicted (including a twist at the beginning of the second half that is absolutely shocking), and the strengths of these, as well as the thought-provoking material dealt with, are able to overcome many of the weaknesses found in the uneven character development.  While Robert De Niro (2000's ""Men of Honor"") and Edward Burns (1998's ""Saving Private Ryan"") both start off with a somewhat shaky, unfocused grasp on their roles of Ed Flemming and Jordy Warsaw, respectively, they manage to strengthen the evolution of both personalities by the film's latter half. Burns, especially, starts off with a noticeable blandness, but somehow transforms along the way to the conclusion into a striking, memorable character.  The stars of the film, however, are Eastern European newcomers Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov, whose frightening, unhinged bad guys turn out to be the center of the movie. Arresting every second they are onscreen, Roden and Taktarov are utterly talented finds that will hopefully find more film work based on what they have accomplished here.  In supporting roles, Melina Kanakaredes (TV's ""Providence"") shows much promise as news reporter Nicolette Karas, who is also carrying on a romance with Eddie. Nicolette is not given an overly generous amount of screen time, but Kanakaredes makes the best of it, fleshing out her character into a sympathetic, realistic individual. Kelsey Grammer is okay as tabloid show anchor Robert Hawkins, successfully getting rid of his ""Frasier"" image, but is so one-dimensional that he spends his time making little to no impression, or going over-the-top. Meanwhile, Charlize Theron (2001's ""Sweet November"") makes a splashy cameo as the black-wigged worker of an escort service.  What ultimately makes ""15 Minutes"" such a success is its willingness to try novel techniques not seen in many years that throw the viewer off balance, making them unsure, and sometimes even a bit nervous, of what is to come next. Not only that, but it is one of those rare recent thrillers that doesn't go the easy route, nor does it present a nonsensical and exploitative storyline for mainstream mass consumption. ""15 Minutes"" actually has something to say, and it says it remarkably well. ",15 Minutes,R,2001,3
4,"The mere idea of _2_Fast_2_Furious_ doesn't exactly set expectations soaring. In fact, it sets off something akin to a universal gag reflex.  ""A sequel to_The_Fast_and_the_Furious_, of all things?"" object the cin‰aste crowd.  ""Asequel to _The_Fast_and_the_Furious_ without Vin Diesel?"" scoff that film'sfans--and, as the original's shockingly robust box office take suggests, thereare a lot of those, for whatever reason.  And then there's that little cherry onthe top of the sundae of disdain: _2_Fast_2_Furious_?  *The hell?!*  While that punny alphanumeric title still clangs to the ears months after itsunveiling, it's understandable why Universal opted to go with thatonce-promotional-only moniker rather than the originally announced_The_Fast_and_the_Furious_2_.  Despite the returning presence of the firstfilm's top-billed star (and, for the record, that is Paul Walker, *not* theDiesel--check the credit line on the poster and DVD) _2_Fast_2_Furious_ feelsless like a true sequel/continuation than a loosely-tied spin-off.  As such, thefilm works all the better for both non-fans *and* fans of the first film alike;the fresh approach keeps the non-fans from making the negative associations with_The_Fast_and_the_Furious_, and those who hold the first film sacred can look atthe film as being something completely different.  And, make no mistake, _2_Fast_2_Furious_ *is* different.  Of course, certainconstants remain: Walker as Brian O'Conner; Thom Barry as the backgroundcharacter of Agent Bilkins; and, naturally, lots of tricked-out cars goingreally, really fast.  But the similarities are only surface-deep; take, forinstance, the opening scene.  It is a street race, and while that descriptionsounds like anything that appeared in the first flick, it certainly doesn'tunfold like anything from the first film.  Unlike the much-vaunted first race inthe first film, which relied a lot on fancy inside-the-car-and-out-again CGItrickery to get the adrenaline pumping, what fuels this chase's rush (and thatof all the action sequences in the entire film, for that matter) are theimpressive practical stunts done by actual people driving actual cars--and, ofcourse, the fact that the cars and their drivers are pretty damn hot doesn'thurt, either.  That last comment may strike as being superficial, but that's what the filmis--and that's *not* meant as a slam.  From the souped-up Universal logo andthat turbo-charged opening, director John Singleton wears the project's shallow,unsubtle slickness as a badge of honor, making it crystal clear that this is afilm strictly concerned with style, attitude, and having a good time.  Unlike_The_Fast_and_the_Furious_, which played its cop-in-deep-cover plot all toomelodramatically straight and displayed too much misplaced conviction inlaughably labored and long-winded soliloquies about street racing being theultimate spiritual liberator, _2_Fast_2_Furious_ is simply about the ride--nomore, no less; not any buried pretense of actual deep meaning behind the ride. And when the ride looks and feels as smooth as this, it's practically irrelevantto complain about any lack of so-called substance.  Not that there isn't a story at work here; there indeed is, but only just enoughto sustain the action.  Those looking for updates on the absentee charactersfrom the first film should prepare to be disappointed, as any questions they mayhave will be met with a stone-faced cinematic silence equivalent to anear-splitting cry of ""Vin *WHO?!*""  Actually, his Dominic Toretto character isreferenced--but not by name and only in passing, and that's how it should be, asit is O'Conner's release of him that put him in his present place: without abadge in Miami, earning some bucks and kicks on the street race circuit as""Bullitt.""  The law eventually, inevitably catches up with him, and so he isgiven a chance to redeem himself by inflitrating the inner circle ofmoney-laundering import/export businessman Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) as one ofhis street-race-recruited grunt drivers.  Joining O'Conner in is assignment is his old friend and ex-con Roman Pearce(Tyrese, not billed with the Gibson surname this time), who also gets a cleanbill of legal health if the plan succeeds.  While this pairing sets up one ofthe more contrived elements of Michael Brandt and Derek Haas's script(specifically, some half-assed psychological explanation/motivation forO'Conner's fateful decision at the end of the last movie), it is definitely oneof the more effective new elements in _2_Fast_2_Furious_.   The presence ofRoman loosens up the bland tight-ass that was the original incarnation ofO'Conner; similarly, Walker shows a more relaxed chemistry with Gibson (withwhom he reportedly improvised a lot of their amusing banter) than he had withhis counterpart in the first movie.  That ease extends to Walker's performanceand general demeanor in this film, which is livelier and a little edgier, inline with the changes in the O'Conner character.  Granted, to state thatWalker's work here compares favorably to his in the first movie isn't saying toomuch, and while he does exhibit a bit more personality this time, he still getstrumped in that department by his lead co-star.  After proving his dramaticchops in Singleton's _Baby_Boy_, Tyrese brings his pure movie star charisma tothe fore as the fast-talking, perpetually-eating goofball that is Roman.  Withhis formidable screen presence and winning sense of humor, he exudes thatindefinable ""It"" from every pore, and with two solid--and vastlydifferent--turns under his belt in his first two film outings, Tyrese's bigscreen career should be an exciting one to follow.  Don't go looking too hard for depth in the more background characters, though. Hauser, who previously provided villainy for Singleton in 1995's_Higher_Learning_, has far less to work with in this film, but he fills the roleof psycho heavy effectively for the modest demands of the film; similarly,Ludacris (billed here as Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) perks up his few scenes asmechanic and race ringleader Tej.  If there's an area that the first film hasover this one, it's in that of the female characters.  The two prominent femaleroles here, undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and racer Suki (DevonAoki), aren't as meaty or memorable as Michelle Rodriguez's badass grrl in thefirst; both characters are tough and strong-willed in their own right, butultimately the two are called on to not do much more than stand, sit, lounge,and/or drive around and look good (which, needless to say, Mendes and Aoki doquite well).  But, again, the look and the vibe is what _2_Fast_2_Furious_ is all about--nomore in the film's bread and butter, the race/chase sequences.  From the outset,it's obvious that Singleton is having a grand ol' time flouting his image as a""Serious Film""-maker and making a  movie  where he can let loose other, nottypically seen sides of himself.  With its larger-than-life stunts, wild angles,kinetic ""how did they do *that*?"" camera movements, anime-like speedenhancements, and rat-tat-tat quick-cut comic book panel frames, thecurtain-raising race sequence plays like a cinematic crash course in Singleton'sfanboy inspirations.  That may seem a bit indulgent (and perhaps it is to acertain extent), but there's no use in complaining since the bag o' trickssucceeds in its intent: revving up the audience and laying down tone for thepicture: extreme fun in high style.  That attitude is upheld as the filmprogresses and the stunts build in scale and magnitude--and do they ever(speeding down a highway backward?) .  But the crashes, jumps, and all assortedmanner of jaw-dropping vehicular insanity that ensue would be chaos if notcaptured in a coherent, captivating manner, and while he dials down the addedflash after the open, Singleton creates some creative and exciting set pieces,aided in no small part by the amazing action shots captured by director ofphotography Matthew F. Leonetti and the editing by Dallas Puett and longtimeSingleton collaborator Bruce Cannon.  Most viewers, I imagine, will likely be too caught up in the ride to really paytoo much attention to all those fast and furious little things that add up tothe larger experience, and that's just as well.  Movies like _2_Fast_2_Furious_are all about the bigger picture in every sense: the rocket speed of the cars;the over-the-top stunts; the firepower of the explosions; the glass-shatteringdecibel level; the uniformly broad strokes in every aspect of the execution;and--last and certainly not least--the size of the box office take.  With_2_Fast_2_Furious_ being just 2 fun 2 deny, success in that last respect shouldbe as effortless as the film's thrills and irresistible style. ",2 Fast 2 Furious,PG-13,2003,2.5
5," This MTV-production revolves around frantic, fateful New Year'sEve party in 1981 in a downtown loft in the funky East Village, wherethe lives of various young couples and friends intersect. Anyone whohas ever spent a dismal New Year's Eve with strangers - virtual orotherwise - can relate to their depressing and desperate angst. RisaBramon Garcia, a highly respected casting director, makes herdirectorial debut so, predictably, despite the modest $6.5 millionbudget, there's a star-studded cast, like Christina Ricci and GabyHoffman as wannabe groupies from suburban Ronkonkoma, Long Island,lighting up with Paul Rudd and Courtney Love, two platonic friends whoagree, if all else fails, to have sex with each other. Jay Mohr, CaseyAffleck, and Brian McCardie cruise the crowd as Ben Affleck playsbartender. Goldie Hawn's daughter, giggly Kate Hudson, makes herfeature film debut as an awkward Upper West Side princess, prone topratfalls, but, nevertheless, holding her own with Martha Plimpton, asthe sad-sack hostess, Dave Chappelle as a slick disco taxi-driver, andJaneane Garofalo in a cameo. Ms. Garcia describes the filming as ""arevolving door of actors, coming in and doing their bit and leaving"" -and it looks it. Despite the fact that an appropriate early '80s songunderlines each scene, there's not much to Shana Larsen's unstructuredscript and dreadful dialogue, particularly when you realize that AIDSwill bring this kind of promiscuity to an end very soon. So, as aresult, all these actors have very little substance to puff on. Or, asPaul Rudd concludes, ""We use cigarettes as a shield against relatingto each other."" On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""200Cigarettes"" is a vapid, clumsy 3, making you long for the morningafter to come quickly. ",200 Cigarettes,R,1999,2
6," ""2001"" is probably the most original film ever made.It is so different from conventional films that,in fact, it may be a different art form altogether.Even the very best films, such as ""Casablanca"",""Rebecca"" and ""Chinatown"" have formulaic elements.In contrast, ""2001"" is in its own world, as ifall the movies made before had never existed.While director Stanley Kubrick has made even betterfilms (""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", andperhaps others I haven't yet seen), ""2001"" willalways be the most impressive, just for itsoriginality and audacity.  The film has four parts.  The first section is thedawn of man.  Man-apes are taught to use tools andkill by an imposing black monolith.  In the secondpart, a second black monolith is found buried inthe moon by astronauts in the year 2001.  This leadsto a mission to Jupiter by another team of astronautsand a talkative, emotional computer named Hal.The final and most surreal part has astronaut Davetraveling to the infinite and beyond.  ""2001"" opened to mixed reviews.  Many critics were(and perhaps still are) put off by the lack ofdialogue and character development, the slow pace,and surreal imagery. ""2001"" is a story told bycinematography, with much of the meaning left tothe imagination of the viewer.  The film's significance was not lost on the Oscarcommittee, however, which awarded ""2001"" BestSpecial Effects and Best Art Direction.  Kubrickwas nominated for Best Director, and the filmwas nominated for Best Writing.  It is odd thatthe sparse script was nominated instead ofcinematography.  The most developed character in the film is Hal,a computer that is more emotional than therobotlike humans that accompany him on themission.  The confrontation between Hal (voicedby Douglas Rain) and Dave (Keir Dullea) is themost interesting part of the film, more sothan the increasingly bizarre and unfathomablefinale.  Trivia: ""2001"" took three years to film.  Supposedlythere was 200 times more film shot than was used inthe final version.  The little girl in the telephonevideo is Kubrick's daughter Vivienne. ",2001: a Space Odyssey,G,1968,4
7,"""What am I doing in this pre-corpse club?"" Paul (Sean Penn) thinks tohimself in voice-over.  As he looks around his hospital room, his fellowpatients are all tubed up, wired up and looking over their shoulders for theGrim Reaper's arrival.   Paul, a 41-year-old mathematics professor, and Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg),who share a marriage on the rocks, are one of three sets of characters whoselives come together tragically in 21 GRAMS, director Alejandro GonzælezI_ærritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga's follow-up feature film to theirwidely acclaimed -- but not by me -- AMORES PERROS.  As he did in AMORESPERROS, the director again rewinds and fast forwards the story every fewminutes so that you'll swear that the editor used a Mixmaster to assemblethe footage.  The director also eschews any use of a stabilizing device forhis camcorder, giving his movie the ugly look of slightly shaky videotape.In the press notes, he argues why he thinks this is a good idea.Personally, I think most audiences prefer the steady and lush look of anon-handle-held camera using traditional film stock over somethingapproximating your neighbor's home videos.  But I digress. Despite the picture's annoying and showy avant-garde techniques, thewonderful acting manages to shine through and grab you.  Penn, who actscircles around Gainsbourg's typically lethargic work, has his acting matchin Naomi Watts (MULHOLLAND DR.) and Benicio Del Toro (TRAFFIC), who head upthe other two sets of characters. Watts plays Christina, who years ago gave up her coke-snorting drug scenefor a life as a well-off suburban housewife and mother.  After her husbandand young girls die in an accident, she returns to her old bad habits.Rapidly sinking into a deep depression, she tells her father at her family'sfuneral, ""Life does not just go on!"" As a two-bit chronic criminal named Jack, Del Toro is a guy who wears hisreligion on his arm and his truck.  Jack's tattoos proudly proclaim ""JesusSaves,"" as does the side of his big pickup.  Most of the movie's charactersare alcohol abusers.  Jack is that as well as a Christianity abuser.  Usingas justification whatever phrase that comes to mind from the Bible, hemistreats his kids and himself. The superlative acting more than makes up for the film's flaws, whichinclude needless confusion and actions that frequently strain credulity.Jack, Christina and Paul pull at our heartstrings, and we are mostdefinitely moved.  Still, I'd love to see an anti-director's cut that didn'ttry to be so artsy and that stuck to the storytelling. 21 GRAMS runs a little long at 2:05.

8,"We throw around aphorisms like ""Seize the Day"" and ""Liveevery day as if it's your last"" without emotionally grasping thesignificance of this shrewd advice.  In ""25th Hour,"" Spike Lee,using a script by David Benioff from Benioff's novel, explores theconcept through the eyes of a man who is not literally living outhis final day on the planet, but who in some ways shares aterminally ill person's angst.  New York resident Monty Brogan(Edward Norton) is due to check into an upstate prison in twenty-four hours to serve a seven-year term for possession of drugs withintent to sell.  Looking at himself realistically as a skinny, good-looking white guy, he knows what's in store for him in the brigevery time the lights in the penitentiary go out.   This is the sort of drama that a run-of-the-mill Hollywood directorwith a big budget would treat as a melodrama, crammed withadrenalin-pumping music, explosions, and shoot-outs with thepolice who would be hot on the trail of a runaway felon.  Thoughwe have no idea why the authorities would allow such a fellowpost-sentencing to be on the loose and consider escape, SpikeLee is far more interested in examining character, particularly therelationships that Monty has developed and is now sadly givingup, affording him good reason to feel that he has thrown his youthaway.  In short this is not a prison drama as such but rather anattractive young person's belated coming to terms with himself,sadly considering ""if only,"" and wondering whether he has any realoptions short of serving his time. The opening of a story finds Monty walking around near a NewYork pier with his Ukranian-born friend Kostya (Tony Siragusa),razzing the large man for his apparent mental thickness.  Montydemonstrates early on that despite his drug dealing which datesback to his selling weed to high-school students, he's a decentguy who takes in a pit bull mix that had been thrown from awindow and left for dead. In this initial scene Spike Lee points upthat Monty could have led a good, moral life but challenges us inthe audience to know when a scene is a flashback and when it istaking place during the single, last day of freedom in the man'slife. Meeting with his dad, James Brogan(Brian Cox), Monty mustfend off suggestions that he escape to a small town out West andin a smashing surreal scene we watch how this option would playout as Monty grows old with his wife Naturelle (Rosario Dawson)and enjoys the company of a bunch of kids to whom he revealshis big secret only when they have grown up.  Monty enjoys hisloving girlfriend Naturelle Riviera (Dawson), whom he had met in aplayground when the woman was just eighteen; and the supportivecompany of his good friends, prep school English teacher JacobElinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and hotshot investment bankerFrancis Xavier Slaughtery (Barry Pepper).  Lee's repeated flashbacks, which continue to blend in withMonty's final day of freedom, explore the varied lives of Monty'scircle, and it is here that scripter David Benioff's sharp dialogeffectively mixes humor with pathos.

9,"The girl-next-door has grown up. Sandra Bullock takes a bravedramatic leap as a drunk stumbling on her way to sobriety in thiscontemporary cautionary tale. Written by Susannah Grant (""ErinBrockovich""), the story begins with Sandra reeling around Mahattan ina boozy haze. She's a drinking, drugging party girl and the debaucherynever stops, even at the wedding of her sister (Elizabeth Perkins).But when she swipes a limo and crashes it into the front porch of ahouse, she gets a DUI and 28 days in court-ordered rehab. And that's areal awakening. Defensive and heavily into denial, she first has to beconvinced that she is, indeed, an addict. Then she has to want to livea different life, even if that means ditching her good-time boy-friend(Dominic West) who'd like to marry her. But the core of the storytakes place in the rehab community, where she meets a motleyassortment of characters including her counselor (Steve Buscemi),heroin-addicted roommate (Azura Skye), an irresistible gay German(Alan Tudyk) - who has the best dialogue in the picture - and atestosterone-laden baseball player (Viggo Mortensen). Yet the visionof director Betty Thomas seems unfocused, skipping from slapstickcomedy to fuzzy memory flashbacks, from a silly riff on soap operas toa romance that never develops, all within the serious substance-abuseconcept. Think of capturing the gallows humor of ""Girl, Interrupted.""On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""28 Days"" is a scrambled 7. ButSandra Bullock shines. She's a revelation, delivering a compelling,surprisingly convincing performance after her recent falters in ""HopeFloats"" and ""Forces of Nature."" Even when she's bruised and battered,she's beautiful, bringing a haunting sadness to her portrayal. ",28 Days,PG-13,2000,2
10,"Demian Lichtenstein's 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND isn't the movie that you'veseen in the trailers, which is a shame.  That movie looked like a lot offun.  Spoofing a bunch of Elvis impersonators out to make a killing(literally) with a high tech casino robbery in Vegas during Elvis week, itis energetic and original.  We know this because the first 20 minutes or sofollow this outline.  But after that, in a hail of thousands and thousandsof bullets, the picture turns into another gorefest that would be an NC-17candidate if the MPAA hadn't long ago fallen asleep at the wheel.  (EvenHANNIBAL is rated R.  Right!) Our Elvis look-alike crooks include Murphy (Kevin Costner), Michael (KurtRussell), Hanson (Christian Slater) and Gus (David Arquette).  After apromising beginning, the guys shed their costumes and the movie turns into abad spaghetti Western -- one too cheesy for Clint to have anything to dowith. Joining Michael for the ride is Courteney Cox, as ""Cybil with a 'C',"" andher thieving 10-year-old son, Jesse (David Kaye), as in Jesse James.  Getit?  Well enjoy it, since that's about as funny as 3000 MILES TO GRACELANDever gets.   The busy script by Richard Recco and Demian Lichtenstein has more holes thanthe proverbial Swiss cheese.  The script attempts to fill all of the holeswith lots of shoot-'em-ups.  And, when he can't think of anything else todo, which is often, the director points the camera at the clouds, which theeditor speeds up.  Cars, especially Michael's fire-engine red, 1959 Coupe DeVille, are shown flying down the highway with the hyperdrive engaged.  Don'tknock it.  It keeps you awake.  Barely. Among the Hollywood actors to drop by for parts is Jon Lovitz -- you know,the guy who invented the Yellow Pages.  ""It's a joke,"" his character tellsMurphy after one of his failed attempts at humor.  You'll need to bereminded of that often in this comedy, which is as flat as the Nevada desertwhere it is set.  Take my advice and don't stay to watch the music videoduring the closing credits.

The answeris pretty obvious.  Movies.  Could you do without seeing a singlefilm for 24 months?  I doubt it.  You'd probably come back in astraitjacket, screaming in agony.  Which is probably why therewas never a Peace Corps member assigned to Afghanistanunder the Taliban.     Josh Hartnett's character, Matt, in Michael Lehmann's ""40Days and 40 Nights,"" denies himself what he wants most.  Sex. For forty days and forty nights.  No women, no self-gratification.  You'd hardly call sex an addiction since every healthy personfeels the need (even from the age of two, as Freud suggest), butit's hardly as strong a passion as the urge to see movies. Nonetheless for Matt and his disbelieving friends, he takes thevow of celibacy.  So skeptical, in fact, are his pals, that they takebets to whether he can pull it off, er, not pull it off, and when thekitty builds to $18,000 the guys who wager that he won'tsucceed make sure he's keeping his side of the bargain.  Hisroommate even has a special light that he uses to scan Matt'ssheets to see that, as he puts it, ""no fluids are liberated.""     You wouldn't think a one-joke comedy can pull it off (so tospeak) for ninety-two minutes but thanks to a snappy script byRob Perez, swift pacing by director Michael Lehmann, andperhaps most of all the clean-cut good looks and affablepersonality of Josh Hartnett, ""40 Days"" succeeds in keeping theaudience charmed, smiling, and happy.  What's particularlyadmirable is that despite its ""R"" rating, this Miramax releaseshows how a subject that could easily become the vulgar pic dujour in a genre that stretches from ""There's Something AboutMarry"" to ""Van Wilder,"" need not be off-the wall ham-fisted andtasteless but can intelligently treat a subject that has keptaudiences in stitches since the days of Aristophanes.  What wehave here is a group of kids in their early twenties who can uttercomplete sentences without a ""like"" or ""totally"" or ""y'know""throughout.     What motivates the action, or inaction, of the central characteris that Matt has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Nicole(Vinessa Shaw) and tries to get her out of his mind by shackingup with a bevy of gorgeous women.  The trouble is that eachrelationship reaches an impasse when Matt, at a moment thathe should be happiest, imagines that the ceiling is cracking.  Hebelieves that his problem is his fixation on sex with Nicole (whois now engaged to another guy) and that he can recover hissanity by freeing himself from desire. Thus his vow to have not asingle sexual relationship, not even with himself, for 40 days(the period of time that Jesus went into the desert to test hisability to deflect Satan's temptations).     If working for a dot-com company is anything like the way it'sportrayed in this fun film, how disastrous that so many of theseorganizations went belly-up  during the past couple of years. Matt is surrounded by fun guys, seductive women, and best ofall he ""clicks"" with the lovely girl-next-door type, Erica (ShannynSossamon).  True to the conventions of romantic comedy,director Lehmann and scripter Rob Perez make sure to putobstacles in their way to keep them apart as long as they canuntil their inevitable reconciliation.  Along the way, we're treatedto some solid comic interaction by an ensemble of young peoplewho look as though they're enjoying themselves as much as weare. ",40 Days and 40 Nights,R,2002,2
12,"Let me introduce you to an average cop movie of 1980s. Themain hero is a rogue macho cop, who never goes by the bookbut whose success in taking out bad guys saves him from thewrath of his superiors, mostly embodied in black captain. Atthe beginning, our hero sees his partner/colleague/friendkilled by the main bad guy, so his job becomes personal. Hisone-man-show investigation is strenghtened by the presenceof another cop/friend/helper who must win his trust, oftenin a series of embarrassing ""buddy buddy"" incidents. Theirmutual quest almost always gets into dead end, before theyget their act together and manage to take out bad guys in afinal showdown. Overuse of such formula in previous decadeis probably the reason why 48 HRS., action thriller byWalter Hill, doesn't look as original and refreshing as itdid during its premiere in 1982.  The plot follows the formula noted above. Violent anddangerous criminal Ganz (James Remar) escapes from theprison farm with the help of his Indian friend Billy Bear(Sonny Landham). Their next stop is San Francisco, wherethey murder one of their old associates, thus bringingattention of the police. Detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte)takes part in their arrest, but the action endsdisastrously, with two of the cops dead and Cates' own gunin the hands of brutal murderer. Feeling personallyhumiliated, and with the reluctant approval of his bosses,Cates begins the manhunt on the city streets, but hedesperately needs some inside information about Ganz. Suchhelp comes in the form of Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy),black and smooth-talking convict who has some personalinterest in seeing his old buddy Ganz behind bars. But, inorder to assist Cates, Hammond demands to be on the streets.Cates reluctantly agrees to bring Hammond out of prison for48 hours; during that time two men must find the criminals,before they kill each other over black/white and cop/convictissues.  Although many times re-used by less talented filmmakers(including Hill himself in disappointing RED HEAT six yearslater and with even more disastrous results in the 1990sequel ANOTHER 48 HRS.), the plot works very well. That ishardly surprising, since the screenplay was written byauthors like Steven E. De Souza, Roger Spottiswoode or  JebStuart - many of them would later earn a lot of respect byproviding scripts for popular action movies of the 1980s.Walter Hill, one of the screenplay co-authors, was still atthe prime of his directorial career and he utilised thescript to the fullest extent. His editing techniques andperfect sense for the movie pace (ideal combination ofaction scenes and ""buddy buddy"" dynamic) overcome the genreclich‰s. Even the overused San Francisco scenery works verywell in this film, together with the good music soundtrack(although the main theme by James Horner would later berecycled by the composer in some 1980s movies).  However, the most appealing thing about 48 HRS. is one ofits two leads. Eddie Murphy, although second-billed, simplyoutshone any other cast members - even such capable actorswith previous Hill experience, like James Remar, DavidPatrick Kelly and Brion James. In this movie Murphy clearlyestablished his on-screen personality of clever,fast-talking and self-confident urban black that would laterhelp him to dominate the box-office and even keep afloatsome movies that would otherwise sink. Watching Murphydeliver such personality - rarely successful combination ofan action hero and comic relief - is a real joy; especiallyin the most memorable scene when he, pretending to be a cop,shakes down an entire racist redneck bar. The scene looks sonatural for Murphy, that the viewer could easily forget thatit was staged. His partner and nominal lead, Nick Nolte, isso inferior and passive in that scene, and that impressionwould remain with him for the rest of the film. So, thanksto the domineering presence of his emerging lead, 48 HRS.was bound to be remembered more as an Eddie Murphy vehiclethan good action movie by its merit. Perhaps without Murphy,this movie would be easy forgotten and all of his flaws andclich‰s (like completely unnecessary subplot involvingCates' girlfriend) more easily revealed. But, whether itowes its quality to Murphy or something else, 48 HRS.deserves to be praised anyway.  (Special note for ""trekkies"": Denise Crosby, later known asLt. Tasha Yar in STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION could beseen in 48 HRS. in the role of bat- wielding roommate). ",48 Hours,R,1982,3
13,"ed at: Loews Lincoln Sq., NYC, 2/10/04     ""50 First Dates"" could well have been inspired by the old gag:Guy goes to his physician:   ""Doctor, doctor, you've got to help me.  I have a real problem.  Idon't remember anything!""    ""How long have you had this problem?""    ""What problem?""        For a good deal of director Peter Segal's  Adam Sandler-DrewBarrymore comedy, the gag is repeated, visually of course, butstill over and over so that even with her accident-acquired braindamage, Barrymore's character would be hard-pressed toforget.     ""50 First Dates"" has a dynamite premise beyond theaforementioned gag.  What is it like to go on a first date not oneor two times but with fifty variations?  We're not dealing with asocially inept woman who'd rather wash her hair than go out asecond time with a guy, but with a beautiful, classy damsel whomust attend to both the joys and sorrows of a succession of firstdates with the same person!  On the one hand, there is the thrillof discovery with someone new, someone you really like.  Onthe other hand, you've got the awkwardness of being with aperson you have, in essence, never seen before and simply donot know how best to act.  This dilemma is not that of HenryRoth (Adam Sandler).  His flaw, not unknown to the malegender, is the inability to commit himself to such an extent thatas the movie opens, he is taking leave of a hot date who wantsto be with him for months to come but hustles off quickly in aspeedboat pretending that he's a secret agent who must headoff to Peru.  For her part a car accident has left Lucy Whitmore,however, with a defect in her temporal lobe that allows her toretain her long term memory so that she has no problem relatingto her dad, Marlin Whitmore, played by Blake Clark, or to herbrother Doug, played by Sean Astin, the latter a dopey, steroid-addicted body-builder unlikely to get even a first date.     Each night, though, she goes to sleep and her memory of theday's activities are erased.  Completely.     True to the Hollywood formula, ""50 First Dates"" mixes comedywith sentiment, giving the audience the lift they came for.  Yetthe film must be faulted on two grounds: One is the vulgarity ofthe comedy, the other is worse: that it is just plain unfunny.  Inthe first instance, we have characters who are idiosyncratic tothe point of tasteless caricature.  These include Ula (RobSchneider), who for reasons unknown to the script is blind inone eye, who has four handsome and giggly kids but whodevotes his time on screen to tasteless physical comedy, actingas Henry's de facto adviser.  One proprietor of the Hawaiinrestaurant patronized by Lucy and Henry is obese, tattooed andfond of pretending he's ready to put an end to Henry's life with ameat cleaver.  Some well-trained walruses they kiss, they givehigh-fives and the like--are fine except that to appeal to AdamSandler's pubescent audience one gets ill and throws up, andthrows up again and again all over the most obnoxiouscharacter in the picture, a woman (or is she a man?) who isHenry's veterinary assistant.  Her (his?) big joke in the movie isgrabbing someone's butt. And oh, there's a gag centering on thesize of a walrus's penis.  That, more-or-less embraces the pointthat there are few laughs with a script that still finds Mr. Sandlerunable to duplicate his adorable and believable performance inFrank Coraci's ""The Wedding Singer,""     Even in a light comedy, in which we're willing to suspend somedisbelief, could you believe that the father and brother of thebrain-damaged woman would even want to protect her so muchthat dad stashes a huge stack of newspapers dated the day ofthe car crash and endlessly plays videos of the same Sundayfootball game?  Or that Lucy would not find out within three daysthat time is passing?     Consider the greatest of all comedies with a similar premise,Harold Ramis's ""Groundhog Day,"" in which a weatherman findshimself trapped in a daily replay of the same 24 hours.  Ramisgives us twists and turns sadly missing in ""50 First Dates.""     Ah but there is one major redeeming feature to the film: Gohome, go to sleep, and when you wake up you won't rememberwhat you've seen. ",50 First Dates,PG-13,2004,2
14,"Two Arnolds for the price of one.  How could you go wrong with a recipe likethat?  Well, in THE 6TH DAY, director Roger Spottiswoode (TOMORROW NEVERDIES) doesn't, coming up with an intelligent and high energy science fictiontale that is a lot of good old fashioned fun. Set in a time -- ""In the near future.  Sooner than you think."" -- in whichcloning has become possible, the cautionary movie opens with an XFL footballgame.  (Just think of the product placement fees that the XFL had to come upwith for that plug.  The NFL, the story explains, is in the midst of a4-year player strike.)  The first $300,000,000 quarterback is severelyinjured in the game.   The solution, of course, is cloning.  Althoughcloning of human organs and of entire animals is legal, complete cloning ofhumans is against the law, so the replacement strategy for the quarterbackis kept strictly secret. As Drucker, the head of a cloning conglomerate and of the XFL, Tony Goldwyn(GHOST) is a villain who is a bit too cold for the part.  His chiefscientist, Dr. Graham Weir, is significantly underplayed by Robert Duvall.The rest of the supporting casting, however, including Michael Rapaport asArnold's sidekick and Michael Rooker, Rodney Rowland and Sarah Wynter, asDrucker's thugs, works quite well. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as helicopter pilot Adam Gibson, is at the top of hisform.  He is lovable, humorous, vulnerable and strong.  A man who has beenknown for some robotic acting at times, Arnold is remarkably human thistime, even when he is a clone.  Early in the story, he is cloned and the badguys under Drucker's orders try to find the real Adam and eliminate him withthe use of some cool guns.  If people find out that there are two Adams,Drucker will go to jail, and his operation will be shut down. The gadgetry becomes an engrossing and hilarious subplot in its own right.Carefully mixing the future with the present, all of the technological toysseem quite realistic.  Car's navigational systems have become capable ofautopiloting.  Holographic images have become the billboards of the future.Kid's dolls become a creepy cross between a real girl and something from THEBRIDE OF CHUCKY.  Get arrested and you are instantly given a virtual courtappointed attorney.  And if you have been worried about sex on the Internet,wait until you see what is possible with a full-sized virtual sex toy.  Thelatter is one of many reasons why the film's PG-13 rating is a bitquestionable. You back up your data regularly, or you should, but do you back up yourbrain?  Drucker does.  Memory dumping becomes part of this intriguing andcomplex story, whose twists come quickly and often.  Even if part of it isfamiliar ground for an Arnold actioner, it is none the less entertaining.It may not be the sort of movie that you'll be discussing a week later, butwhile you're there, you'll have a high old time. THE 6TH DAY runs 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for strong action violence, briefstrong language and some sensuality and would be acceptable for teenagers.","6th Day, The",R,2000,2.5
15,"Credit Universal Studios for one thing: when it came time to createa trailer for ""8 Mile,"" rap superstar Eminem's high-profile featurefilm debut, they made a damn good one. Maybe even the most invigoratingand energized of the year. The finished product, however, pales deeplyin comparison. Written by Scott Silver (1999's ""The Mod Squad"") anddirected by Curtis Hanson (1997's ""L.A. Confidential,"" 2000's ""WonderBoys""), ""8 Mile"" is gritty, downbeat, and more legitimate than, say,last year's Mariah Carey fiasco ""Glitter."" It is also an unexcitingtelling of a by-the-numbers storyline, complete with character actionsthat don't make a lick of sense because of how underdeveloped they are. Set in the slums of Detroit, circa 1995, Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr.(Eminem) is a young factory worker who finds himself moving back intothe trailer park home of his mother (Kim Basinger) after he breaksup with his allegedly pregnant girlfriend, Janeane (Taryn Manning),whom he leaves his car with. Loved by his baby sister, Lily (ChloeGreenfield), and despised by his mother's loutish boyfriend, Greg(Michael Shannon), Jimmy dreams of one day making it big as a rapper,but continuously freezes up in front of big crowds. He finds much-neededsupport in best friend Future (Mekhi Phifer), emcee at a local rapclub, and potential new girlfriend Alex (Brittany Murphy), who iswilling to do whatever it takes to get out of Detroit. When it was announced that a filmmaker of Curtis Hanson's staturewas going to direct Eminem in a motion picture, one couldn't helpbut sit up and take notice. The treatment of the cliched story, however,is far below what Hanson has proven himself in the past to be capableof. A sort of rags-to-riches tale that ends after the achievementof success but before the earning of money, ""8 Mile"" is one of thosemovies where the central character goes against all odds to, at leastfor a moment, be happy. Everything that surrounds this plot, includingmany of the supporting characters, are so superfluous and disappointinglyused it comes as a surprise that Hanson could be so unfocused. A needlessscene in which Rabbit defends a harrassed gay coworker thuds with a resounding falseness.  The tale of Rabbit's dream of being a musician has been done so manytimes it ceases to be stimulating. More intriguing, but also moreuneven and frustrating, are the subplots concerning his confused mother,who discovers she is being evicted, and his relationship with Alex.Going au naturale, Kim Basinger (2000's ""Bless the Child"") deliversthe film's most powerful performance, as a woman who clings to unsavorymen for reassurance even when she would be better off without them.As the confusingly loyal yet unfaithful Alex, Brittany Murphy (2001's""Don't Say a Word"") deserves better than what this terribly writtenrole has to offer. Alex serves little purpose in the film, and evenless by the end when she turns out to not be quite as savory as youwould expect. At the same time, the audience is unfairly asked to forgive and like her. As for Eminem, who has never acted before but is the only rapper Iactually like, his performance is mostly natural and unforced. Ifthis story is partially autobiographical, as has been speculated,then his turn is all the more impressive because it is more difficultto portray yourself in a movie than a different character. Althoughcertainly not Oscar material, Eminem easily surpasses Mariah Carey'sacting and about equals the underrated Britney Spears, from ""Crossroads."" The new hit Eminem single, ""Lose Yourself,"" although prominently usedin all of the advertising for ""8 Mile,"" outrageously only shows upduring the end credits. In fact, very little of Eminem's music isfeatured within, leading one to suspect severe false promotion. ""8Mile"" has its share of effective moments, and isn't without merit,but ultimately collapses in sloppiness the further it artificiallydigs beneath the surface of its characters. ",8 Mile,R,2002,2.5
16,"During the late 1960's and early 1970's, when college studentsacross the land were protesting the Vietnam War, the ""America:Love It Or Leave It"" types would sniff, ""These kids should besitting in the classroom and learning.  That's what college is for."" Not exactly.  People do not give up their humanity when theyenter the ivy-coated walls of the university.  Though most aremerely at the cusp of adolescence, students are three-dimensional human beings and what's more their hormonesrequire activity.  Activity during what used to be an idealistic agecould properly be directed at protests especially if rock musicaccompanies.  One of the principal characters of ""Abandon,""Embry (Charlie Hunnam), is not necessarily idealistic but he'scertainly keen on activity outside the classroom.  About tograduate summa cum laude from a prestigious school (actuallyfilmed at McGill University in Montreal), he suddenly disappears,leaving behind two first-class tickets to Athens.  Vanished intothin air. Suddenly the police want to know why and where.  (Don'task what the cops were doing just after his disappearance.)     ""Abandon,"" then deals with Embry's abandonment of collegeand of his girlfriend Katie (Katie Holmes), a theme that dovetailsinto Katie's abandonment by her dad when she was young, whichlinks into Katie's abandoning Harrison (Gabriel Mann) who eagerlypursues her following Embry's disappearance.  Credit writer-director Stephen Gagham, whose resume includes scripting of""Rules of Engagement"" and ""'Traffic,"" with giving his audience aHitchcockian psychological thriller which may not make us overlyfamiliar with the edges of our seats but which is an intriguingdetective story/thriller/romance filled with engaging characters.     Katie and Embry are the most engaging of all.  Embry, forexample that's the guy who disappeared just before graduatingsumma cum laude and who had previously set off on anarcheological expedition of Crete is seen leading a large chorusof college students in the performance of William S. Byrd's""Gloria"" from ""Mass for Four Voices"" which is supposed to be aLatin mass written by monks not for the entertainment of otherhuman beings but directly to God.  The charismatic Embry(played by a guy who may just be the next Brad Pitt) commandsthe attention of a rock star in leading his group singing in Latin,selecting none other than Katie to be his star soprano.  Hencetheir relationship, cut off mysteriously by Embry's disappearance.     Gaghan wants to explore various sides of Katie to give us afairly deep picture of this conflicted human being, one who isunder pressure to complete her senior thesis, to study for finals,and to prepare for and go on job interviews. (She has a 3.94 GPA,which makes one of her interviewers think she can calculate howmany pennies it would take to fill the interview room.)  Katie ispursued by Harrison despite his being told that the two of themare just friends.  Katie is pursued by the school psychologist towhom she repairs to talk about her stress.  Katie is pursued by adetective, Wade Handler (Benjamin Bratt), and by the team ofinterviewers for a finance company and more particularly by oneparticular fellow who is about to become a partner in that very firm. Everyone likes Katie.  Why?  Who knows?  She's cute and a fineactress, but I'd probably go for Zooey Deschanel.  She's the onewho stole the show from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jennifer Anniston in""The Good Girl.""  I hope she never tries to play Medea or LadyMacbeth but in comic roles she's a knockout.  Here Ms.Deschanel does not get the chance to say naughty things overthe microphone to shoppers at a Wal-Mart, but she capturesevery funny line in ""Abandon"" with her sexual advice to herroommates and others.    No, college is not just for study.  Anyone who has been to themovies during the past couple of years knows that every universityeast and west of Bob Jones University is the place to have funbefore donning your Brooks Brothers suit, Paisley tie, andtasseled loafers.  But Katie is not having the kind of fun she wouldlike, not after being abandoned by the love of her life, and""Abandon,"" while not being terribly original or about to moveHitchcock and Polanski aside is a well-made package of chillsand obsession. ",Abandon,PG-13,2002,2
17,"For those moviegoers not akin to having the Force be with them, ""Abouta Boy"" offers a highly entertaining, pleasingly unsentimental alternativeto the box-office onslaught of ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack ofthe Clones."" More than proving that they have undeniable range outsideof their raunchy ""American Pie"" escapades, directors Chris Weitz andPaul Weitz have concocted a warmly comical, heartfelt gem that sidestepsan easy maudlin tone for something more grounded in reality. Hugh Grant (2001's ""Bridget Jones's Diary""), in what is certainlyone of his most adept and likable performances, stars as Will Freeman,a self-involved slacker who has lived his entire adult life off ofthe royalties from a one-hit-wonder song his dad wrote years ago called""Santa's Super Sleigh."" With no real life goals except to sleep withone attractive woman after the next, his fate changes when he decidesto attend a single parent's support group in an attempt to meet anemotionally insecure woman. Through this, he ends up meeting, andlater befriending, 12-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the bulliedson of his latest female prey's friend. Marcus instantly seeks solacein the home of Will after his depressed mother, Fiona (Toni Collette),makes a suicide attempt. From this surprising odd-couple relationship,Will is forced to face up to what a shallow, wasteful life he has led up to this point. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby and lovingly adapted by Chris Weitz,Paul Weitz, and Peter Hedges (1993's ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""),""About a Boy"" is content in trading in predictable plotting for acast of characters who have all been written with a great deal ofaffection and sympathy. In the summer movie seasons when special effectsrule the multiplexes, it comes as something of a comfort to find asmall, genuinely funny and poignant motion picture about people simplytrying to make it through their everyday existence in one piece. Alternately narrated by Will and Marcus, the bond that forms betweenthe two is a pleasure to watch take shape. At first, Will looks atMarcus as little more than an annoyance who keeps showing up on hisdoorstep. After all, he has no desire to have children of his own--onlydate women who do. What he learns from the wise Marcus, however, allowshim to open his eyes to the goings-on around him, and to his own life.A lesser movie would treat this adult-child relationship as cutesyor maudlin, but directors Chris and Paul Weitz are more intriguedin portraying the reality of the situation. The film only benefits from this. In Will, Hugh Grant has been given a chance for the first time since1999's ""Notting Hill"" to play a character who isn't one-dimensionallyslimy, as he was in 2000's ""Small Time Crooks"" and 2001's ""BridgetJones's Diary."" At the onset, Will is undoubtedly a womanizer whoresorts to lying just to win women over. It is a testament to thelikability of Grant that he instantly wins you over and, by the end,has you deeply involved and rooting for his happiness. In his superbfilm debut, Nicholas Hoult makes for Will's splendid counterpart, Marcus.  Other actors in the film also get their individual moments to shine.Toni Collette (2002's ""Changing Lanes"") gives a heartbreaking performanceas Marcus' unconventional, clinically distraught mother, Fiona. Colletteis an actor's actor--a virtuoso performer who makes her every momentonscreen ring with a resounding truthfulness. Rachel Weisz (2001's""The Mummy Returns""), in a very good, believable turn, shows up asRachel, a single mother whom Will meets and evolves actual feelings for.  Through sharp, often acidic dialogue that only sounds better whentransported to the British accented mouths of the characters, ""Abouta Boy"" may be gently touching, but it is also enormously funny. Allthe way through, the picture has a smooth, relaxing air about it thatis thoroughly enjoyable, if not overwhelmingly earthshaking. The effectiveclimax, in which Marcus gains the courage to perform the Roberta Flacksong, ""Killing Me Softly,"" at a school talent show, could have turnedsappy with one false move, but never does. That is the biggest pleasureof ""About a Boy."" Just when you think you know where the film is going,and when it is going to lose its way into sentimentality, it surprisesyou. Just like real life.",About A Boy,PG,2002,3
18,"Much has been written in pop psychology magazines aboutmale mid-life crisis: the time that men at about age forty takeinventory of their lives and resolve to make changes.  Most realizethat they're not going to be CEO's and worry about the way theirhormones are losing their edge.  Some get nifty MercedesKompressors, others (especially during the 1960s and 1970s)wear their weekend shirts unbuttoned, strings of beads decoratingtheir hairy chests.       Since senior citizens are not as sexy, stories about them arelargely missing from the big screen.  Since most moviegoers areunder the age of forty, the studios worry about baleful box officesas films like ""On Golden Pond"" fail to bring in the MTV crowd.     ""About Schmidt"" is one of the exceptions.  Dealing with a fellowwho has turned sixty-six years of age, the film might beconsidered good at art, less sanguine at commerce, since afterall, would the youthful audience want to look at a codger whorarely smiles, who is not on the make, and who is tossed onto thedustbin by both his profession and his family?  The big differencehere is that Warren Schmidt is played by Jack Nicholson in a leadperformance called by Hollywood Reporter online ""sublime"" and ""atough act to follow.""  Yet while Michael Rechtshaffen of that tradepaper calls the movie ""blisteringly funny,"" he gives his readers theidea that this is a no-holds-barred laugh fest when in fact it issomething better: ""About Schmidt"" is a family comedy repletewith Checkhovian themes more comparable to that playwright's""Uncle Vanya"" than to Jay Roach's ""Meet the Parents.""    Though ""About Schmidt"" can be read as a Sinclair Lewis-styleput-down of Midwestern blandness and babbitry, directorAlexander Payne together with his co-scripter Jim Taylor hasmore important issues in mind.  The film should be seen as anEveryman story, perhaps a warning to those of us who are stillshort of senior citizenhood to seize the day, possibly as anexistential cri de coeur on the theme of loneliness, alienation, andthe meaningless that many of us feel our lives have becomes andthe banality of human existence.     Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) has just retired from his job asassistant Vice President of Woodmen Insurance Co. after thirty-two years' service.  After hearing a round of hackneyed speechesat his retirement party and suffering the cockiness of his muchyounger replacement who has no use for his advice, he has yetmore crosses to bear.  His wife Helen (June Squibb) has suddenlydied and Schmidt, who had been irritated by everything she does(""Who is this old woman who is living in my house?"") begins tomiss her terribly.  He  uses the Winnebago Adventurer with whichhe and his wife planned to use to tour the country to head out toDenver where his daughter Jeannie (Hope Davis) is to be marriedto a waterbed salesman, Randall Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney asunrecognizable as ""The Hours""' Nicole Kidman).  Warren thinkslittle of his future son-in-law and tries to convince his little girl notto marry the klutz: we wonder whether he really opposes Hertzel'scharacter or whether he simply does not want to give up the lastsignificant human being in his life.     ""About Schmidt"" is blessed by a smashing supportingperformance from Kathy Bates as Jeannie's future mother-in-law,Roberta Hertzel, a liberated woman who speaks openly about herhysterectomy, about the sexuality which she felt since the age ofsix, and her belief that Warren should have nothing to worry aboutsince his daughter and son-in-law will always be great ""betweenthe sheets.""  The funniest scene has Roberta climbing into a hottub just after Warren's immersion pendulous breasts swinging asshe hits on the terminally embarrassed retiree.       Jack Nicholson carries the movie, appearing in every scene, hissignature facial expressions making dialogue almostunnecessary.  The voice-overs, done unobtrusively in the form ofletters that Warren has been writing to a six-year-old Tanzanianboy he has ""adopted"" by sending him twenty-two dollars eachmonth, fill the gaps in the narrative fortuitously.     In Checkhov's ""Uncle Vanya,"" the title character, who has spenthis life working the estate of a pompous professor, ultimatelyleave the grounds, looking forward to an uneventful, barelybearable routine that had become his way of life.  That AlexanderPayne, whose previous, edgy works like ""Election"" (which spoofsAmerican politics) and ""Dear Ruth"" (which shows the absurdity ofboth sides on the abortion debate), can be compared to Chekhovis no small tribute. ",About Schmidt,R,2003,3.5
19,"      'Absolute Power' is another testament to Clint Eastwood's ability as atalented filmmaker.  What makes Eastwood so good is not only his diversity insubject matter from 'Play Misty for Me' (1971) to 'Unforgiven' (1992) but hisuncanny ability to take films with relatively long scenes and stretch theminto the most absorbing films made anywhere by anyone.       'Absolute Power' is an extremely powerful motion picture filled withintrigue (both political and social) that manages to construct its plot linein a manner suitable for building to a daring climax but also in a way forserious discussion after you leave the theatre.       A life long criminal who specializes in high profile burglaries(Eastwood) forces his way into a mansion one evening and upon committing aroutine heist is forced to hide in seclusion when others arrive.  From hisviewpoint he witnesses a sexual escapade which leads to a murder involving abillionaire's wife and the most powerful man in the world, the President ofthe United States (Gene Hackman).  Also involved in the clandestine crime aretwo Secret Service agents (Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert) and thePresident's Chief of Staff (Judy Davis).       The investigating homicide officer who tracks Eastwood to the scene ofthe crime (Ed Harris) is the film's protagonist who is the key to the film'scentral focus.  Eastwood has an estranged daughter (Laura Linney) who getsdangerously close to the investigation not necessarily for her own good. Rounding out the film's cast is veteran character actor E.G. Marshall as abillionaire and political king maker.  It's his wife who is murdered.       Oscar winning screen writer William Goldman ('All the President's Men')is credited with this clever screenplay based on the novel by David Baldacci.       What makes 'Absolute Power' so enjoyable to a large extent is seeingEastwood gradually move into parts that fit his age.  He is well seasoned inthis film (Eastwood is 66)and he doesn't perform any silly physical stunts and the film isn't filledwith unnecessary violence.  Instead it relies on heightened scenes of keepingthe audience guessing what's to come next.       This is a smart film brimming with conniving wit that manages to remainhighly entertaining and credible throughout its entire running time. ",Absolute Power,R,1997,2.5
20,"When James Cameron started working on TITANIC, many expectedthat project to fail and with a good reason. In late 1980sCameron was heavily involved in project with many strikingsimilarities to 1997 ""Oscar""-awarded epic - both were shoton water, both required revolutionary special effects, bothrequired ridiculously high budgets, both representedincredible psychological challenge to the cast and crew. Theresults of Cameron's efforts were, however, different in -while TITANIC became one of the most successful cinemaprojects of all times, his 1989 science fiction epic THEABYSS is almost forgotten by now.  The plot, based on Cameron's script, begins with Americannuclear submarine USS Montana chasing unidentifiedunderwater object in the waters near Cayman Trench inCaribbean Sea. The chase results with USS Montana hittingthe underwater reef and sinking with all hands aboard. Dueto heavy Soviet naval presence in the area, US Navy wants toorganise quick salvage and enlists the help of civiliandivers situated on nearby experimental underwater oil rig.Virgil ""Bud"" Brigman (played by Ed Harris), the team leader,is not particularly happy about this arrangement, and hisenthusiasm is further diminished after arrival of hisestranged wife Lindsay (played by Mary ElizabethMastrantonio) who designed the rig. Lindsay is accompaniedby the team of elite Navy SEALs led by Lt. Coffey (played byMichael Biehn), and soon the series of incidents would puteveryone on the rig to the ultimate test. Severe storm cutsall links with the surface and the rig crew is faced notonly with the immediate task of survival but also with theseries of strange phenomena. While Lindsay becomes convincedthat those events have something to do with friendlyunderwater aliens, increasingly paranoid Lt. Coffey wants toprevent submarine's nuclear missiles from falling into enemyhands.  When the author of this review saw THE ABYSS for the firsttime, he was so blown away by the experience that he gave itthe best possible ""10/10"" grade in his review for the localscience fiction fanzine. As years passed, the author of thisreview learned that some great films can't look that greatafter the second viewing, so this was the last time I gavesuch a high grade without allowing some time to pass and putinto perspective. However, although THE ABYSS to me nowlooks worse than during the first viewing, it is still morethan interesting film experience that includes betterdisplay of Cameron's filmmaking talents than TITANIC. Butthose two films had separate fates - one was commerciallysuccessful, and had its commercial success was mirrored inrave reviews; the former was commercial failure and manycritics jumped on the bandwagon by calling it a setback inCameron's career. Cameron had additional reasons to bedispleased by THE ABYSS - the film was subjected to heavycutting by the studio, leaving some important plot issuesunresolved and audience had to wait 1992 Special Editionbefore seeing Cameron's true vision.  However, even in its 1989 version, THE ABYSS is great film.The film lasts for more than two hours, yet the audiencecould hardly expect to be bored. On the contrary, there arefew films so exciting as this one, due to Cameron's abilityto fill almost entire running time with spectacular andbreath-taking action scenes and, in the same time, allowenough plot development to make us care about thecharacters. Three years earlier Cameron used the sametechnique in ALIENS and this is probably the reason why somecritics viewed THE ABYSS as repetitive and tried to describeit as ""ALIENS under water"". There are plenty of similaritiesbetween those two films - plot takes place in isolated,claustrophobic location; characters are almost constantlyforced to fight for their lives; roles are played byensemble cast of character actors instead of regularHollywood stars; relationship towards technology isambivalent; heroine fits into Cameron's post-feministstereotype of strong, self- conscious woman who can takecare of herself in male-dominated environment; politicalsubtext of the film is again influenced by the Cold Warescalation of Reagan years - but there are also differences.  The major difference is, of course, in the way Camerontreats First Contact. While in ALIENS he stuck to the darkand disturbing vision of original creators and portrayedouter space as a place full of unspeakable horrors humanbeings can't handle, Cameron takes more optimistic approachin THE ABYSS. New frontiers - in this case depths of oceaninstead of outer space - represent both the challenge andopportunity; the biggest threat to mankind is not from theoutside, but from within - irrational instincts from oursubconscious that make us react to anything new anddifferent with ignorance, paranoia and outright hostility.According to this film, civilisations technically moreadvanced than humanity are also morally superior to humans;they managed to overcome such instincts, otherwise theywould perish in self-annihilation similar to nuclear warthat used to haunt us during Cold War. This thesis isexplicitly given in final scenes of 1992 version thatexplain a plot, but also seem somewhat too preachy andsimplistic. 1989 version, on the other hand, suffered fromplot not being explained enough. It takes almost an hourbefore the protagonist experience first alien sightings;until that time (and even after the finale) THE ABYSS mightbe viewed as a standard action/disaster film with wholealien subplot being nothing more than screenwriter'safterthought.  However, this structural flaw won't prevent the audiencefrom enjoying THE ABYSS. Cameron again shows his tendencytowards perfectionism and extracting all talents andresources at his disposal. Acting in this film is reallygood. Ed Harris shines in his role, allowing class conflictto play part in love story. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio isvery convincing as a woman whose social skills representtotal opposite of her abilities to handle extremesituations. Michael Biehn, who played squeaky-clean heroesin two previous films by James Cameron, is refreshinglymenacing as psychotic naval officer. Todd Graff serves as anexcellent comic relief. Photography by Mikael Salomoncreates effective atmosphere, and special effects aretop-notch. Musical soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is good,although it might sound somewhat too corny compared toHorner's work in ALIENS.  Another reason why fans of science fiction cinema should payattention to THE ABYSS might be found in the scenes whereCameron pays homage to the classics of the genre. Aliens andtheir vehicles look like those in Spielberg's CLOSEENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, while ""Bud""'s visit to alienunderwater city might remind many of the final scenes inKubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Some might argue that thelevel of originality in this film below criteria ofmasterpiece, but THE ABYSS is nevertheless great film thatshould deserve much better reputation. ","Abyss, The",PG-13,1989,3
21,"      Ace Ventura, a guy with an outlandish Hawaiian shirt and long sideburns, has nothing but bad hair days.  Without any of the refinementshe has shown in some of his latter films, Jim Carrey, as Ace Ventura,keeps the humor in this one insufferably crude.  The first Ace film inhopefully a short series is called ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.  Neverhas a film been less in need of a sequel than this one, but aftermaking over a hundred million dollars in 1994, there has, regrettably,already been one sequel.       In need of a better script than the one by Jack Bernstein, Carrey,and the director, Tom Shadyac, Carrey struts his stuff withoutrestraint.  The director lets Carrey run wild, which in Carrey's caseis a dangerous thing to do.  Carrey is an undeniable comedic genius butone in need of control.  As proof of how good Carrey can be, considerhis relatively more restrained performances in LIAR, LIAR and THE MASK.       Typical of the crude bathroom humor in ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVEis a scene of Ace bending over and manipulating his rear in a sick formof ventriloquism. The rest of the movie is the same, ad nauseam.       To the extent that the movie has a plot, it involves Ace, loudmouthed, pet detective extraordinaire, in search of a professionalfootball team's dolphin mascot, which was stolen two weeks before theSuper Bowl.  The team uses Ace to track down the animal.       The script is devoid of ideas, and the movie plays as if it wereone long ad lib routine by Carrey.  Sean Young, who, since her oneexcellent part in NO WAY OUT, gives her usual forgettably badperformance, this time as a police detective.  She and all of the otheractors provide little more than a backdrop for Carrey's showing off.ACE VENTURA has one memorable scene -- the ending credits, which bringblessed relief. ",Ace Ventura Pet Detective,PG-13,1994,1.5
22,"Well, it took twelve months, but a motion picture has finally beenreleased in 2002 that is as audaciously original as 2001's ""DonnieDarko,"" ""Mulholland Drive,"" and ""Moulin Rouge."" ""Adaptation,"" directedby Spike Jonze (1999's ""Being John Malkovich"") and written by CharlieKaufman, is a mind-blowing experience in more ways than one, a cinematictreasure so daring, so unpredictable, so unconventionally brilliant,and so purely entertaining that it is a miracle it got made in thefirst place. For those who thought ""Being John Malkovich"" was ""out-there,""they haven't seen anything yet. Several years ago, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was hired to adaptSusan Orlean's non-fiction book, ""The Orchid Thief,"" into a film,only to discover that a faithful rendering would not be cinematic.The book, based on Orlean's article in New Yorker magazine, tellsof John Laroche, a man so in love with the rare Orchid flower thathe risked being arrested by taking them from the swamps of a nationalpark in the Everglades. When Kaufman's attempts in adapting this talefailed, he found himself using the basis of Orlean's work as a jumping-offpoint to write a different sort of film that included Orlean and Kaufmanhimself as the central characters. Director Spike Jonze's ""Adaptation"" is the wondrous result of Kaufman'sstruggle. Although far from the truth, in the screenwriter's mindCharlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage) is overweight, balding, and painfullyintroverted. When he is commissioned by Valerie (Tilda Swinton) toadapt ""The Orchid Thief,"" Charlie finds himself with a terrible predicamentand a nightmarish case of writer's block. No matter how much he studiesand digs within his source material, he cannot find a visual, interestingway to write the script. Not helping matters in Charlie's more assuredtwin brother, Donald (Nicolas Cage), who is writing his own screenplay:a conventional serial killer thriller called ""The 3"" that is immediatelypicked up by the studio currently in production on Charlie's ""BeingJohn Malkovich"" (Jonze, John Malkovich, Catherine Keener, and John Cusack make cameos). In an underlying plot set three years earlier, Susan Orlean (MerylStreep) has begun researching her article (and later her book) byinterviewing John Laroche (Chris Cooper). Susan, who is married butunhappy, is drawn to Laroche's inspirational way of looking at Orchids,and realizes that she has never had anything in her own life thathas inspired her in such a way. When Valerie proposes to option thefilm rights to her book, Susan is thrilled, not knowing that her unknownscreenwriter, Charlie, has formed a heartbreaking crush on her. Believe it or not, this is merely the set-up for what is to followin ""Adaptation,"" a one-of-a-kind creation that twists and turns, buildinglayer upon layer, time frame upon time frame, and fact within fiction,into a richly drawn, unforgettable tapestry about not letting lifepass you by. More than that, even, screenwriter Kaufman has concoctedone of the most truthful and searing portrayals of writing and moviemakingthat has ever graced the silver screen. When Charlie sucks up hispride and agrees to attend a screenwriter seminar with author RobertMcKee (Brian Cox), the result is both painfully honest and cathartic. The screenplay, which is also credited to Donald Kaufman (a fictionalcreation of Charlie's), is startling in its multiple dimensions ofthe human beings on display and their inner struggles. As Charliegrapples with his writing assignment, he continuously strikes outwith the women he has grown to care about because of his unrelentingshyness. Meanwhile, Susan Orlean's entire outlook on her life changeswhen she comes to the scary insight that she has never felt completelypassionate about anything before. She yearns to have the feelingsthat John Laroche has, and is uncontrollably drawn to him because of this.  The trio of central performances are nothing short of incendiary.It has taken him seven years, but Nicolas Cage (2002's ""Windtalkers"")has finally found a marvelous role worthy of the promise made by 1995's""Leaving Las Vegas."" Cage dually stars Charlie and Donald, and heis so good in his facial expressions and body language that you forgetalmost immediately they are both being played by the same actor, andaccept them as two completely separate individuals. Making an indeliblereturn to the big screen after a three-year hiatus, Meryl Streep (1998's""One True Thing"") is phenomenally powerful and even sometimes extremelyfunny as Susan Orlean. In one felt swoop, Streep reminds the viewerof why she is considered one of the greatest actresses of all time.Finally, Chris Cooper (1999's ""American Beauty"") develops John Laroche'sinitial appearance of being a sort of backwoods redneck into a kind,intelligent, and charming man with more on his mind than meets the eye. Surrounding Cage, Streep, and Cooper are a bevy of superlative supportingperformances. Cara Seymour (2002's ""Gangs of New York"") is touchingas Amelia, Charlie's would-be girlfriend who clearly would reciprocateCharlie's feelings for her if only he had the courage to express them.Judy Greer (2001's ""The Wedding Planner""), as a diner waitress whorelates to Charlie through her love of orchids; Maggie Gyllenhaal(2001's ""Donnie Darko""), as Donald's vivacious girlfriend whom hemeets on the set of ""Being John Malkovich;"" and Brian Cox (2002's""The Ring""), as brutally candid seminar speaker Robert McKee, areequally fabulous with only a handful of scenes each. ""Adaptation"" is the rarest of cinematic treasures--a movie that engulfsthe viewers in characters, stories, and complexities they have neverbefore seen. Almost immediately beginning with a mesmerizing fast-motiondepiction of the creation of the world since the dawn of time, andconcluding with a corkscrew of a final act that is as surprising andunforeseen as it is devastating, director Spike Jonze once and forall places himself within an exclusive group of modern filmmakersas great as any working today. Endlessly enlightening, always fascinating,and nothing short of miraculous, to see ""Adaptation"" is to live, see,breathe, and feel in an entirely different way than any other motionpicture released this year has offered.",Adaptation,R,2003,3.5
23,"      ADDICTED TO LOVE is a fresh and surprisingly good, romantic comedyby actor Griffin Dunne in his first time as a director of a featurelength film.  In it writer Robert Gordon creates a wondrous tale of twojilted lovers who reluctantly join forces when they find that theirex-lovers are now living with each other.       Sam, played by Matthew Broderick in a role somewhat reminiscent ofhis character in INFINITY, is an astronomer with a big heart.  Everyday at high noon, he points his huge telescope down to earth so thelove of his life, Linda (Kelly Preston), can wave to him from the parkin their little town.  When Linda disappears, leaving only a ""DearJohn"" letter for him, he tracks her down to New York where she isliving with a Frenchman named Anton (Tcheky Karyo).       Sam, looking disheveled and with his constant 4-day-old beard,sets up shop in an abandoned warehouse across from Anton's apartment.Using all of his scientific prowess, he begins graphing everythingright down to Linda's degree of smile.  With the data he is confidentthat he can predict when Linda will break up with Anton and return tohim.  Afterall, these same statistical techniques worked for him whengazing at the stars.  Well, as you can imagine, humans are much lesspredictable than celestial bodies.       Into Sam's cozy world comes Maggie, played by Meg Ryan in her bestcomedic part since WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...  Ryan, who is one of themost talented actresses working today, is probably most enjoyable inher funny parts, but, to be honest, it is in her serious roles as inCOURAGE UNDER FIRE and, one of my personal favorites, WHEN A MAN LOVESA WOMAN that her greatness shows best.  All of this notwithstanding,she is terrific in ADDICTED TO LOVE.       Maggie was tossed aside by Anton, and she wants to get even withhim.  She does not want to kill him, but if he died, well, people dieevery day.  She moves uninvited into Sam's lair and starts watchingAnton and scheming ways to seriously mess up Anton's life.       Biker Maggie, with her punk rocker heavy black eye shadow and hertough-as-steel attitude, sets Sam straight from the beginning.  Shesleeps naked, but he is not to interpret that as a come on.  Sheelaborates on the pain that she will inflict on him if he even touchesher.  Ryan is given some great dialog and hurls sexual insults at Samas well as the absent Anton.       From the beginning, you know that Sam and Maggie are bound to gettogether.  The intelligent script makes the inevitable enjoyable anywaybecause the characters created are so incredibly likable andinteresting.  You want them to fall in love and do not care if it isclearly preordained.  Tough Ryan dishes out one funny line afteranother to straight man Broderick, and the chemistry between them isbeautiful.       Several key decisions were made that make the film work so well.One was to concentrate on two leads rather than four.  Karyo andPreston support the leads but never compete with them for screen time.Broderick, in a recent interview, said that he felt awkward playing arole that director Dunne could have played himself.  While true, thecasting remains perfect as is.  Broderick has the good sense to letRyan set the rhythm for their interactions and roll with the punches.       Easily, the most intriguing and innovative aspect of the movie isSam's use of a camera obscura to project Linda and Anton's images intoSam and Maggie's hiding place.  This delicious plot device is milkedfor everything it is worth.  Sometimes Sam and Maggie even set on a oldsofa, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER-style, and make up funny dialog for whattheir ex-lovers are saying to each other.       ADDICTED TO LOVE is a sweet show, even in its blackest moments.It posses a high spirited energy and a perfect sense of timing thatnever loses the audience's attention.  Only in the needlessly slapstickbody cast scenes does the movie ever bog down.  An intelligent picturethat leaves you enchanted and delighted as you leave the theater.  Ifound myself bursting into song in the parking lot for reasons unknown.Good movies can cause such strange reactions. ",Addicted to Love,R,1997,3
24," Despite its superb performances, this is a bleak film about oneof life's dissolute losers. Set in a tiny New Hampshire town in thedead of winter, Nick Nolte is the local cop and snow-plower who'sbrow-beaten by the town's real-estate power broker, unhappily divorcedfrom his wife, and painfully alienated from his pre-teendaughter. Except for his waitress girl-friend, Sissy Spacek, no onewants to be around him, even his drunk, sadistically violent andemotionally abusive father, James Coburn, who allowed his mother tofreeze to death in their isolated farmhouse.  As the story unfolds,solemnly narrated by his younger brother, Willem Dafoe, we find outhow he came to be who he is and why, when a local union boss isaccidentally killed in a deer-hunting accident, he is told to justlook the other way - if he wants to keep his job. Instead, he indulgeshis conspiracy theories involving foul play and discovers somedevastating truths about himself, his past, and his future.  Adaptedfrom a novel by Russell Banks, this sanity-to-madness saga should bemore emotionally affecting than it is, but writer/director PaulSchrader (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"") invests so much coldlycalculated gloom, doom, and foreboding into every cruel scene thatthere are few highs and lows. From the beginning, Nolte's life is oneof tortured, desperate rage.  With no self-esteem, he is spirituallyadrift and neurotic, unable to maintain a relationship with anyone. Inshort, he's a wreck. His life is in shambles. All his dark angst issymbolized by a persistent, throbbing toothache which he suffersthroughout. Both Nick Nolte and James Coburn deliver remarkableperformances, but on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Affliction""is a desolate, uncompromising 6. One of the most harsh, depressingmovies of the season. ",Affliction,R,1998,3
25,"""After the Sunset"" signals an unwillingness to grow and a lazy tendencytoward more of the same for director Brett Ratner. 1997's ""Money Talks""was a humor-heavy heist picture, while 1998's ""Rush Hour"" and 2001's""Rush Hour 2"" remained snugly within the confines of the buddy copcomedy. 2002's surprisingly effective ""Red Dragon,"" a prequel to ""TheSilence of the Lambs,"" was apparently but a quick detour, becausehere Ratner is again, making yet another heist film. Comedy, witha propensity toward a lot of predictable banter and too many stereotypicalgay jokes for comfort, once again leads the way, this time unsuccessfully.The only difference is that there isn't much of anything to recommendabout ""After the Sunset,"" outside of its deceptively unconventional setup. With most crime movies of this sort ending with the thieves ridingoff into the sunset and living happily ever after on the beach, screenwritersPaul Zbyszewski and Craig Rosenberg pose the question of what happensnext, once the final score has been done? The answer found in ""Afterthe Sunset"" is discouraging, to say the least. Instead of going offin fresh and interesting directions, the film resorts to wearisomecliches and a complete lack of originality. Following their last heist, master thieves/lovers Max Burdett (PierceBrosnan) and Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) travel to an exotic islandresort to begin their peaceful retirement. Almost immediately, Maxbegins to yearn for his old life, not helped by the appearance oftireless FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson), who has managed totrack them down and is set on catching them in the act. When Stanalerts Max to the fact that the final diamond they are missing ina series of three is setting sail on a nearby cruise ship, Max startsmaking plans to pull off the steal while still eluding Stan and nativeinvestigator Sophie (Naomie Harris). This time, however, Max willalso have to do it without the help of Lola, who makes it clear sheis finished with her life of crime and wants to settle down. Movies like ""After the Sunset,"" free of character depth and not cleverenough to wade from formula, make one wonder what filmmakers and actorssee in them. The genre can be done right if there is style and charismainvolved„see 2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"" and 2003's ""The Italian Job""for recent examples„but even the best of the lot waver the line ofdisposability. The luscious cinematography by class-act Dante Spinotti(2000's ""Wonder Boys"") is naturally attractive thanks to the tropicalon-location scenery, but there is no story to support it. ""After theSunset"" is content to go through the motions and, adding insult toinjury, can't even derive any suspense out of its climactic heist.So anticlimactic is Max's steal on the cruise ship that it barelymakes an impression at all. Pierce Brosnan, who has made a career out of this type of role withthe James Bond series, 1999's ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and 2002'sslightly more substantial ""The Tailor of Panama,"" looks understandablybored as the boring, suave Max. As love interest Lola, Salma Hayek(1999's ""Wild Wild West"") is afforded little to do but nag and pleadwith Max to stay on the straight and narrow path. Far more friskyand promising are the interactions between Woody Harrelson (2003's""Anger Management"") and Naomie Harris (2003's ""28 Days Later""), makingsomething out of nothing as unlikely agents Stan and Sophie, who pairup to nab Max and Lola and find themselves uncontrollably attractedto each other. The less said about Don Cheadle (2003's ""The UnitedStates of Leland""), the better. His turn as an all-business kingpinis virtually a cameo, and a transparent one at that. With lame jokes abounding, a romance that gives the viewer no reasonto care about either party, and a heist so incompetently portrayedthat it renders the entire project irrelevant, ""After the Sunset""is a long slog through a pretty sea of thankless twaddle. If therewas a point to the film being made and, thus, wasting millions ofdollars in the process, director Brett Ratner must have kept suchreasons to himself. 2004's earlier heist effort, ""The Big Bounce,""a failure in its own right, suddenly seems not quite as futile. Atleast that movie was offbeat. ""After the Sunset"" wallows in banality. ",After The Sunset,PG-13,2004,2
26,"      It has been over a year now since I last gave a movie a full fourstars, but I saw one this weekend that got my **** rating.  I can onlydescribe THE AGE OF INNOCENCE as devastating.  Martin Scorsesedescribed it as his ""most violent film"".  This is from a director whobrought you TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL.  The violence in the film isstrictly mental.  There is no physical violence or even threats of any.The ""violence"" is strictly mental because the film, set in the late1800s, is about repression and entrapment in an age of carefullyprescribed moral actions.       The sex in the film is mainly some great handholding althoughthere are a few kisses.  The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus isspectacular and deserves an Oscar.  The images of New York in that ageare unforgettable.       The casting was excellent (Daniel Day-Lewis as Newland Archer,Michelle Pfeiffer as Ellen Olenska, and Winona Ryder as May Welland),and the acting and directing near perfect.  Numerous Oscarpossibilities in this film.  You could feel the repression of a societywhere you must act in a certain way and where most rules were extremelystrict and yet most were implicit and unspoken.  Depending on your sexit would be hard not to identify with one of the key actor oractresses.  You feel repressed when you left the theater.       When the movie was over, I could hardly move.  It was the samefeeling I got when I first saw ALIENS.  I just set there staring at ablank screen.  The movie left such a strong impression on me that wordsseem inadequate to describe it.       THE AGE OF INNOCENCE runs 2:19.  I thought the editing (ThelmaSchoonmaker) perfect and would not want to see a single frame removed.The movie is rated PG although what it did to keep it from being ratedG is not clear.  Anyone older than 8 could see it, but you probablyneed to be at least 15 to begin to truly understand it.  This is a gemof a movie; a near perfect movie.  I award it **** and recommend thismovie strongly.  Don't miss it! ","Age of Innocence, The",PG,1993,4
27,"The original AGENT CODY BANKS was a fun little film about junior secret agents. The story was just plausible enough to be credible and the characters wereendearing.  But its sequel, AGENT CODY BANKS 2: DESTINATION LONDON, is justsilly and stupid.  The original was a kid-friendly film, but the sequel turnsthe youngsters into jokes, who are never believable as little CIA agents. ""Remember, trust equals death,"" super-secret CIA Agent Cody Banks (FrankieMuniz) is told by his adult trainer.  ""Now go write that in your lunchbox,Banks.""  The original was a good-spirited comedy, but the sequel is just aridiculous spoof that would have gone straight to video were it not for thetheatrical success of its predecessor.  The biggest problem with AGENT CODY BANKS 2: DESTINATION LONDON, however, isthat it is Hilary Duffless, since Duff did not sign on for the sequel.  Inaddition, Muniz, who was a little old for the original, is way too old atsixteen to repeat his part.  If this silly script had any chance of working, itwould be for a fresh face of about eleven to have been offered the lead.  Whenyou dumb-down the script, you have to cut back on the age of the actor to starin it.  Some jokes aren't too bad.  The best of these involve killer Beanie Babies whodon't always perform on command.  The plot -- set in London where guys saythings like, ""Take your bum off my Bentley."" -- involves a bad guy named VictorDiaz (Keith Allen) who has stolen mind control software.  Maybe that is theproblem.  It wasn't Don Rhymer who wrote the script but some nefarious mindcontrol software out to enslave the minds of kids foolish enough to buy ticketsto this dog of a picture.  AGENT CODY BANKS 2: DESTINATION LONDON runs way too long at 1:41.

28,"With last spring's ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" and now ""Alex andEmma,"" Kate Hudson is doing what she can to replace Meg Ryan as America'sromantic comedy sweetheart. Unfortunately, Hudson has yet to finda film within the genre that is worthy of her grace, charm, and sheerlovability. Directed by Rob Reiner (1999's ""The Story of Us""), ""Alexand Emma"" wants to be the next ""When Harry...Met Sally,"" pitting aseemingly mismatched couple together who may be perfectly right foreach other, but it lacks the romantic spark and worldly knowledge of that former classic. Writer Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) has found himself in hot water witha gang of loan sharks whom he owes $100,000 to. If he doesn't completehis next novel in thirty days and collect the monetary payment, he'sdead. Enter Emma Dinsmore (Kate Hudson), an opinionated stenographerAlex hires to help him finish it in time. As Alex orally spits outhis book's words, Emma diligently types it for him. The novel's story,crosscut with the real-life action, tells of a teacher named Adam(Luke Wilson) who finds himself in a love triangle with the snootyaristocratic mother of his pupils, Polina (Sophie Marceau), and Polina'shousekeeper, who starts out as the Swedish Ylva before segueing intothe German Elsa, and then the American Anna (all played by Kate Hudson).Meanwhile, Alex and Emma find themselves caught up in an instanceof life imitating art, as their gradually forming relationship startsto mirror that of Alex's characters. Penned by no less than four screenwriters--Rob Reiner, Jeremy Leven(2000's ""The Legend of Bagger Vance""), Adam Scheinman (2000's ""Bait""),and Andy Scheinman--""Alex and Emma"" suffers from a distinct staginessthat the novel-come-to-life sections fail to compensate for. In fact,the sequences set within the novel are easily the weakest of the lot,burdened by a crummy, unimaginative premise that wouldn't hardly passmuster within a Harlequin romance. Meanwhile, the scenes between Alexand Emma offer a handful of nice laughs and winning moments, but becausethe majority of them are set within a dank-looking Boston loft, theyfeel more suited for an off-Broadway stage. When the movie finallyopens up a little to portray Alex and Emma out on an idyllic day together,the proceedings are suddenly energized before settling in on a frustratingclimax filled with misunderstandings and subsequent ""break-up-and-get-back-together""scenes. Just as she was in her crowning achievement, 2000's ""Almost Famous,""and recent box-office hit ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" Kate Hudsonis the star attraction, and for good reason. Hudson's looks and mannerismsmay be occasionally reminiscent of her mother, Goldie Hawn, but shehas a naturalism and commanding presence all her own. As Emma, Hudsondoes as much as anyone could with an underwritten part. As her novelalter-egos, she garners easy laughs by putting on a stream of over-the-topforeign accents. As Adam, Luke Wilson (2003's ""Old School"") sufferswhen he is put in the same frame with the more radiant Hudson, butis blandly likable on his own. And as Polina, the woman who gets betweenthem, Sophie Marceau (1999's ""Lost & Found"") is criminally wastedin a shrill, one-dimensional role that does her no favors. It isn't that the viewer does not root for Alex and Emma to get togetherin the end; it's just that the story and plot developments they havefound themselves in are so beneath their natural charisma and intelligence.Try as he might to recapture his ""When Harry...Met Sally"" glory days,Rob Reiner has fashioned ""Alex and Emma"" as a romantic comedy relyingtoo much on the well-worn cliches of the genre to come off as anythingbut a marginally innocuous time-waster.",Alex and Emma,PG-13,2003,2.5
29,"""Alfie,"" a remake of the 1966 film starring Michael Caine in the titlerole, thematically reminds of a more accessible, personalized versionof the recent ""I ? Huckabees."" Although it is easier to wrap yourfinger around, and, thus, more audience-friendly for the mainstreamfaction, it is in no way simpler or condescending. An accurately observedslice-of-life-cum-coming-of-age story about a philosophical womanizer'sbumpy road to processing the choices he has made and discovering thatthere is more to life than one-night-stands, ""Alfie"" is smart, understated,and unusually perceptive. For the smooth, seductive Alfie (Jude Law), a limousine driver livingin the heart of the Big Apple, his free time„and occasionally hisworking hours„are all about two things: ""women and wine."" Stronglybelieving that a lot of something is better than just one, his playboylifestyle is but a series of flings, some more long-term than othersbut never with the promise of monogamy. Single mom Julie (Marisa Tomei)is his sort-of, quasi-girlfriend, but she is at a point where shewants to settle down into a relationship and is starting to catchAlfie's drift that he isn't the man to do it with. The older Liz (SusanSarandon) is a Manhattan socialite, a female representation of Alfiewho is always ready for a good time but not always with the same person.Nikki (Sienna Miller) is a wild party girl who worships the feet ofAlfie after taking a ride in his limo, but threatens to become toomuch of a handful. And cocktail waitress Lonette (Nia Long) is theex-girlfriend of Alfie's best friend, Marlon (Omar Epps), her actionswith Alfie after a night of drinking she soon regrets. ""Alfie"" is a studio picture with an unlikely protagonist, that ofan unapologetic man willing to sleep with any woman, single or not,that he comes across. Although Alfie does and says unsavory things,there is a purpose behind them for the climactic payoff to work. Writer-directorCharles Shyer (2001's ""The Affair of the Necklace"") and co-screenwriterElaine Pope avoid sugarcoating the candidly raw Alfie, who often waxesphilosophic directly to the camera. Breaking down the fourth wallis a tricky cinematic undertaking that demands just the right unforcedtouch to work, and it does here. Most important of all, as the viewerobserves Alfie's actions and gets to know him as he gets to know himselffor the first time in his life, he becomes deeply sympathetic in a three-dimensional way. The way in which the script juggles its large ensemble of charactersis time-efficient and close to faultless. Alfie's story is told throughhis varied interactions with the women in his life, each one givenenough time to make an impact as a person who feels real rather thana thin screenplay creation. And while there are a number of amusingcomedic moments, it is in the drama of Alfie's self-discovery thatthe film gains its loftiest and most truthful resonance. Several scenes are downright invigorating to watch and experience,either from a touching emotional standpoint„a moment between Alfieand Lonette following a difficult decision she makes; a bitter run-innear the end between Alfie and best friend Marlon„or from a senseof freedom and joyful energy that director Charles Shyer and unobtrusivelystylish editor Padraic McKinley (2002's ""Igby Goes Down"") captureto great effect. The cinematography by Ashley Rowe (2004's ""ChasingLiberty"") is lovely and picturesque, painting the Christmas seasonin Manhattan with utterly gorgeous strokes that make the city looklike one of the most exciting places in the world. The incendiaryoriginal music by Mick Jagger, John Powell, and David A. Stewart aidsimmeasurably in underscoring the emotions present in each scene withoutwading into heavy-handedness. In a year in which Jude Law is all over the place„""Sky Captain andthe World of Tomorrow,"" ""I ? Huckabees,"" and the upcoming ""Closer""and ""The Aviator""„his sterling, dashing work as Alfie will be toughto beat. Although the screenplay offers depth to the role, it is Lawwho makes this ant-hero a likable, if flawed, person worth caringabout. The top-notch actresses surrounding him bring additional gravitasand support to their scenes, including Nia Long (2000's ""Big Momma'sHouse""), Marisa Tomei (2001's ""In the Bedroom""), Susan Sarandon (2004's""Shall We Dance""), Jane Krakowski (2003's ""Marci X""), and stunning newcomer Sienna Miller. There are times as ""Alfie"" rounds the corner to its finish line thatthreaten to become routine, as Alfie makes his way around town reunitingwith the women in his life and being faced with one eye-opening discoveryafter the next, but director Charles Shyer fortunately never quitefalls into a predictable melodramatic pattern. If anything, the finalmoments of ""Alfie"" dodge expectations to offer something a bit morerestrained and genuine than what most viewers will likely be countingon. ""Alfie"" is a gratifying early surprise of the autumn movie season,an intelligent and wise film that finds vast entertainment value inone man's own existential crises. ",Alfie,R,2004,2.5
30,"Following in the footsteps of 2003's successful collaboration, ""FreddyVs. Jason,"" ""Alien Vs. Predator"" comes off as a less inspired, lessoriginal knockoff. It is also so watered-down in the horror and goredepartment that not once does it induce a single shiver or feelingof nervousness in the viewer. This may not be the motion picture writer-directorPaul W.S. Anderson (2002's ""Resident Evil"") initially planned to make,but the finished product is clearly what studio 20th Century Fox askedfor„a family-friendly, PG-13 rehash of the unanimously R-rated ""Alien""and ""Predator"" series', built out of pure greed and a reckless disregardfor what the fans see these kinds of movies for in the first place. Intended as a loose sequel to the 1980s-set ""Predator"" films and aneven looser prequel to the future-set ""Alien"" quadrilogy, the present-set""Alien Vs. Predator"" wastes no time in setting up its premise. Whena sudden rise in heat emanates from below Antarctica's surface, ultra-wealthyindustrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) enlists a teamof specialized scientists and adventurers, including environmentalistand expert climber Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), to travel down to thecontrolled area for exploration purposes. What the team discoversis an ancient pyramid, one whose frequently moving chambers make itimpossible to stick together. Even worse, they come to find themselvesin the middle of a war between two species from space„Predators, whoonce ruled the Antarctic land, and Aliens, who have been used as reproducingpawns to help train the younger Predators. Pity poor Paul W.S. Anderson, who can never seem to make the filmhe sets out to. 1997's ""Event Horizon,"" a sort of ""The Shining""-in-spaceflick, had its tense moments, but was burdened by reported studio-enforcedcuts. 2002's ""Resident Evil"" was also severely chopped up, this timethanks to the inconsistent, pompous MPAA board. Now here comes ""AlienVs. Predator,"" which takes the general path of both series', but hasbeen rendered impotent by the insane demands of a studio obsessedwith the PG-13 rating. It is difficult to say whether the film wouldhave been worthwhile even with the stomach-churning, blood-curdlingmaterial intact, but having it could have only helped. Audiences goingto see ""Alien Vs. Predator"" want„no, expect„to be treated to violent,graphic death scenes and gore galore. What they will receive is anattractive but empty horror-lite version, suitable for pre-teens,that cuts away from the violence every time it is about to take place.The film offers no valid payoffs; it is akin to dedicating fifteenweeks to a reality series or ongoing television drama and then forgettingto watch the finale episode. Now imagine such a quandary occurringover and over again, and that is what the experience of watch ""AlienVs. Predator"" is like. The plot of ""Alien Vs. Predator"" is preposterous and its charactersstock figures from the official handbook of one-dimensional cliches,but in an icky sci-fi thriller such problems can be easily overlookedif said film is genuinely effective from a visceral standpoint. PG-13horror can achieve spine-tingling chills„look no further than 1999's""The Sixth Sense,"" 2001's ""The Others,"" 2002's ""Signs,"" and 2002's""The Ring."" What is offensive about this same rating being given to""Alien Vs. Predator"" is that director Anderson has been forced tocompromise not only his vision, but squander the talents of his technicalcrew. The editing by Alexander Berner (2002's ""Resident Evil"") isa hack job, with so much footage cut out of the action sequences thatthey become murky and nearly incomprehensible. The scares are non-existent,their attempts more of the ""false-jump"" variety (none of which work)than from a building of tension. The deaths, as mentioned, are plentifulbut mostly off-camera, making the picture a slasher film without theslashing. The movie is also a horror film without a true sense of requisite uneasiness. Sanaa Lathan (2003's ""Out of Time"") makes for a sturdy, memorablesuccessor to female heroine Ripley, played in all four ""Alien"" picturesby Sigourney Weaver, as the similar Alexa Woods. Lathan has littleto work with, but she ably brings vulnerability, strength, and realityto her every scene. That is more than can be said for the rest ofthe terrible cast, particularly French male lead Raoul Bova (2003's""Under the Tuscan Sun""), who doesn't seem to understand what he issaying in English. The rest of the crew members are strictly of thechopping-block persuasion. Finally, sole ""Alien"" returnee Lance Henriksen(2000's ""Scream 3"") plays the original Bishop, whose descendants inthe earlier entries were robotic replicas, but is underused. ""Alien Vs. Predator"" isn't about acting, or screenwriting, or heartfeltdrama. It is about the chase, and the horror of the situations, andthe slimy creep factor of the alien species, but it fumbles the outcome.The film is blessed with some accomplished cinematography by DavidJohnson (2002's ""Resident Evil""), a hybrid of moody gothic architectureand atmospheric Egyptian inspiration, and the particulars of the climaxboast stylish showmanship while being appreciably unpredictable. Furthermore,Paul W.S. Anderson shows efficiency in his filmmaking style, as hehas in the past; perhaps one day he will be able to make the moviehe wants to without any interference from outside sources. As a genrepic, however, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" simply doesn't make the cut. Afterall, why watch an undercooked, virtually bloodless remake of all theother ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" flicks when they were done better andtreated the ir audience with more respect? There is no reason to. ",Alien vs. Predator,PG-13,2004,1.5
31,"Space ships are so complicated that notwithstanding the twomillion year history and prehistory of humankind, the ability toascend to the heavens was gained in only the last forty years orso.  Take a look at the ship trotted out by Ridley Scott in his1979 film ""Alien,"" today considered a classic which boastsspecial effects as its principal star.  There are buttons all overthe place, even a series of some twenty different levers andgadgets if you should want the vessel to self-destruct.  Whiletraveling beyond the ionosphere, you could be hit by a meteorand one wonders whether there's any way the crew can steerclear of shooting stars, particularly considering the hours theytake to sleep and the banter that passes for conversation atmeal time.  The last thing anyone need to go wrong is to havesome alien aboard: Some creature reflexively hostile to movingobjects that do not resemble its massive hulk.  When this titlefigure does appear, we wonder why the command center onearth, known as Mother, did not anticipate with a contingency. Then again, given the increase tense conversations engaged inby the diverse crew, especially by a guy who seems to havebarely recognizable emotions, we begin to think that there'ssomething that the command center on Earth knows about thereal meaning of the mission that six out of the seven crewmembers do not.     This intriguing idea which is mirrored in the many Americanmovies that fantasy about special, evil, operatives in the CIAand FBI, is just one of the subtexts of Ridley Scott's film, todayconsidered a classic and a breakthrough event during the1970's an era said by some to be the golden age of bothAmerican and European cinema. During the seventies the sci-figenre gained new momentum after the public tired of the cornyblack-and-white features of the fifties: The ""Star War"" serieswas born.  An audience of people below the age of thirty,though impressed by the special effects in ""Alien,"" at the sametime may wonder why the creepy monster that springs from thechest of one of the crew and grows larger, stronger and fiercerwith each of its murders, should have been awarded an Oscar. Remember, though, that we're talking 1979, part of a decadethat saw few if any computers in the homes of Americans andthe Internet was strictly a tool of specialists in university.research.     What Ridley Scott has successfully created in his secondfeature, two years after ""The Duellists,"" was atmosphere.  Thefilm starts slowly, like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" introducing itslargest character, the ship ""Nostromo,"" before honing in on thecrew.  We learn that the ship is headed back to Earth, anuneventful journey that finds its astronauts joking about whetheror not they're entitled to a bonus.  The captain, Dallas (TomSkerritt), is the most relaxed, with Lambert (VeronicaCarthwright) in the navigator's seat.  Ash (Ian Holm) is theprincipal scientist, Kane (John Hurt), excels in dry humor, Brett(Harry Dean Stanton) is famous for tersely saying ""right"" inresponse to others, Parker (Yaphet Kotto) just wants to party,while Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), will prove the heavy when theship hits the fan.       Sticklers for following the contract signed with Mother back onEarth, they are mandated to check out the source of a bizarrecommunication not emanating from natural channels.  Landingon an seemingly barren planet, they discover what appears tobe a large jellyfish.  Kane looks too closely: the small, octopus-like creature attaches itself to his face.      Director Scott drives the tension as though pushing his footslowly on an accelerator.  From a quiet look at the Nostromo, hecarefully distinguishes each character from the other, pushingthe ante ever so slowly to bring the audience to frenziedexcitement.  In so doing, he repudiates the tendency of action-adventure movies nowadays that begin with a bang (think ofhow each James Bond work opens with fireworks beforeslowing down).  The frights are calibrated, first by showing thesmall creature leaping out an attaching to Kane's face, later bythe growing figure of this bizarre entity which picks off the crewone by one.       Among other attributes, ""Alien"" punctuates a strong role for awoman, played by Sigourney Weaver as a take-charge typewho antagonizes the others in the crew by refusing to override arule mandating a quarantine for Kane.  By the final twenty orthirty minutes of ""Alien,"" the tension has grown measurably.     To put together digitally re-mastered version, a team of filmarcheologists fetched boxes of original negatives in London,including outtakes and original sound recordings.  Ridley Scottthen chose the footage he wanted included in this new,director's cut while at the same time he trimmed increments of10 or 15 seconds from various scenes to add to the film'senergy.  Jerry Goldsmith's music, influenced perhaps by Holst's""The Planets,"" adds to the atmosphere, tones which someconsider among the scariest because of their very minimalism.     I somehow missed the first showing of the movie when itopened in May 1979 but can imagine the greater impact theeffects had on an audience not accustomed to the likes of H.R.Giger's design of the creature.  Michael Seymour productiondesign is responsible for a good deal of atmosphere, keepingthe action flowing through the types of mysterious corridors thatappeared in, say, ""The Shining.""  The picture was followed sixyears later by James Cameron's ""Aliens,"" also featuringSigourney Weaver, as the sole human survivor of ""Alien"" returnsto the planet with a the U.S. Marines, prepared to liquidate thecreatures. ",Alien: The Director's Cut,R,2003,3.5
32,"""Alive"" is one of the best disaster films ever made.  This maybe because it is based on a true story,  thus avoiding theusual disaster formula of presenting us with dubious (butdemographically diverse) characters and unrealistic heroes.Another difference from the typical disaster movie is thatthere are no real villians in ""Alive"".  The character that comesclosest is the plane's mechanic, whose greatest crime is stealingan injured girl's coat.  The story is very compelling, and the subtitle ""Miracle ofthe Andes"" is well deserved.  (Although ""Horror of the Andes"" maybe even more appropriate.)  It is a miracle that anyone returnedfrom those mountains alive.  ""Alive"" begins with a chartered plane full of Uruguayan soccerplayers, en route to Chile.  There is a storm, and their planecrashes into the desolate Andes mountains.  The plane crash isstunning.  I doubt that Hollywood has ever done another better.  About half the passengers, mostly young male soccer players,survive the crash.  They nurse the wounded, obtain shelter fromthe cold, obtain water, ration food, and wait for a rescue thatdoesn't arrive.  Needed leadership is initially provided byangst-ridden team captain Antonio (Vincent Spano) and medicalstudent Roberto (Josh Hamilton), but later surprisingly arisesfrom Nando (Ethan Hawke).  Antonio's despair, Roberto'spettiness, and Nando's vision all come across with credibility.The nature of the story provides dramatic tension, and thesetting (the Andes mountains) provides superb cinematography.  ""Alive"" will always be infamous in film circles because of itssubject matter: the survivors were forced to cannibalize thedead, since there was no other source of food.  It is unfairlycynical to judge the film by this, but undoubtedly that haskept the film from receiving its due merits or box officesuccess. ",Alive,R,1993,3.5
33,"Beneath Miami's glitter the high-rise hotels, the babes inbikinis, the Lexus dealerships and yacht showrooms lies anunderclass of people who exist in trailer parks watching BugsBunny cartoons in cabins decorated with Confederate flags andcommission-only people doing dangerous jobs that get theminto trouble with lowlife criminals and hassles with the police.  Allthis is illustrated in Kevin Bray's ""All About the Benjamins,"" co-written by and starring producer Ice Cube. But ""All About theBenjamins"" merely dabbles in sociological commentary.  Its trueimport is a test of the chemistry between motormouth comicMike Epps and Ice Cube in the traditional setup of straight-manand stooge: a convention that dates back at least to Laurel andHardy and Abbott and Costello. But since Ice Cube is hardly adimwtited straight man we can compare ""Benjamims"" mostclosely with ""Rush Hour,"" which pitted fasttalking Chris Tuckerwith fast-moving but straight- acting Jackie Chan.  Released justone week before yet another buddy-movie parody, ""Showtime,""""All About the Benjamins"" may offer nothing to new but is sofast-moving in the usual action-movie traditions displayinggorgeous girls, car chases, explosions and comic violence thatonly a churl can fault it for not showing more about its messagesof race and class in America.  Cube was better cast in GaryGray's ""Friday,"" however,  which, although lacking a strong plotspread the word about underprivileged youth trying to survive inL.A.'s South Central 'hood.      Ice Cube performs in the role of Bucum Jackson, a bountyhunter who works for Martinez (Anthony Giaimo), getting tenpercent of the put-up bail for each minor felon he captures(though the way the bounty system works could have used anexplanation for those in the audience who've never had a coplook at them cross-eyed).

34,"""Life's a bitch and then you die.""  This aphorism is neverspoken in Mike Leigh's latest look into working class trials, nor,ultimately, does Leigh draw that conclusion.  But his leadingcharacter, the wonderful Timothy Spall, does say at one point,""We are born alone.  We die alone.""  Not original, but then, thedown-home people like taxi drivers, supermarket checkers, andcustodians of nursing homes are not about to quoteKierkegaard.       But philosophies they do have, nonetheless.  Following adeparture with his biopic about Gilbert and Sullivan three yearsago,  Mike Leigh returns to his signature observations of realityin ""All Or Nothing,"" which, if Charles Dickens did not have acopyright of the title could have been called ""Bleak House.""  Andlife is bleak bleak bleak in the three families observed by Mr.Leigh, its writer-director, whose ""Secrets & Lies"" might havebeen filled with more intrigue and powerful emotions while thistime around Leigh is consumed with pathos.  Leigh takes us to aworking class development in Southeast London to look at threefamilies and the problems brought on not only by the lack ofmoney but by the frustrations engendered by the boredom ofunskilled work and the obstinacy of their teen-aged children.     With an ensemble led by Timothy Spall as Phil and LesleyManville's as Phil's common-law wife, Leigh centers hisattention on Phil, giving us a strong feeling for what a day's workis like for a taxi driver with his diverse assemblage ofpassengers.  He injects humor into one conversation betweenthe laconic man behind the wheel and one English-speakingFrench woman who wonders aloud whether his kids are a fat ashe is and who chastises him for taking her through a tunnelwithout warning her in advance of the route.  As if the grind ofhis job were not enough, at home he suffers the indignities ofhearing his obese son Rory (James Corden) regularly tell hisparents to bugger off, nor can he feel much pride in his equallyobese daughter Rachel (Alison Garland), who is a cleaner in ahome for the aged and is conversationally virtually catatonic.     While we watch the shenanigans of his neighbors, aswell who include the always drunk Carol (Marion Bailey) andher daughter Samantha (Sally Hawkins) who comes on to boysas a tease; and the relatively happy supermarket checkerMaureen (Ruth Sheen), who daughter Donna (Helen Coker) isknocked up and beaten by her jerk boy friend Jason (DanielMays)-Leigh's main concern is the loss of love between Phil andPenny and the way that a family crisis offers hope ofredemption.     Those who know Timothy Spall's work those lucky enough tohave seen him in other Mike Leigh films such as ""Life is Sweet,""""Secrets and Lies"" and ""Topsy Turvey"" realize that a film like""All Or Nothing"" is worth seeing even if just for the chance ofwatching his expressive, unshaven face register terminalresignation.  When he turns off both his cell phone and the lineleading to the office of the taxi manager, we expect him todepart his vale of tears and perhaps, were it not for an accidentthat offers the hope of renewed love at least for a while betweenhim and his family, that would be his expected fate.  Theprincipal drawback to the movie is the lack of subtitles, andwhile this is not a Ken Loach job which would be impossible tocomprehend without that assist, the low volume of speechthroughout the story requires a keen and attentive audience ear. ""All Or Nothing"" seems about as valid a picture of thedesperation of a working-class family, particularly one whosedaily grind has erased most traces of love, as you can get. ",All Or Nothing,R,2002,2.5
35,"    Cameron Crowe's first film since ""Jerry Maguire"" is soengaging, entertaining and authentic that it's destined to become arock-era classic.  Set in 1973, this slightly fictionalized,semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age story revolves around ababy-faced 15 year-old (Patrick Fugit) prodigy whose intelligence andenthusiasm land him an assignment from ""Rolling Stone"" magazine tointerview Stillwater, an up-and-coming band. With the help of PennyLane (Kate Hudson), a bewitching ""Band-Aid,"" he meets the charismaticlead guitarist (Billy Crudup) who invites him to join the tour, muchto the dismay of his mother (Frances McDormand) who relentlesslyrepeats, ""Don't do drugs!""  Soon he's part of the inner circle of theband he idolizes, disregarding the caution of his rock critic mentor(Philip Seymour Hoffman): ""Friendship is the booze they feed you tomake you feel cool."" Eventually, of course, the rookie reporterbecomes disillusioned, honest and unmerciful. What's so compelling isCrowe's infallible casting which doesn't have a single discordantnote. Patrick Fugit embodies innocent bewilderment, revealing onelayer of surprise after another. Billy Crudup is dynamite, a superstarwaiting to happen. Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's real-life daughter)gives a captivating, flamboyant yet hauntingly poignant performance.Frances McDormand is bracingly funny, playing with perfectpitch. Philip Seymour Hoffman is mesmerizing, exploding like a landmine. Finally, Crowe, cinematographer John Toll, art directors ClayA. Griffith & Clayton Hartley, and costume designer Betsy Heimanncleverly capture the sense of time and place.  On the Granger MovieGauge of 1 to 10, ""Almost Famous"" is a soaring, spirited 10.

36,"""Along Came Polly"" aspires to be both a love story and an outrageouscomedy, a'la ""There's Something About Mary"" (even the title none sosubtly recalls that 1998 Farrelly brothers hit), but writer-directorJohn Hamburg fails to achieve such a feat. The romance is implausibleand unconvincing, while the humor never quite takes flight to achieveits comedic capabilities. What is left, then, is a purely formulaicromantic comedy not fresh or memorable enough to garner an identity of its own. When Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) gets married to the lovely Lisa Kramer(a wasted Debra Messing), they follow it up with what is supposedto be an ideal tropical honeymoon. Instead, things take a disastrousturn when Reuben catches Lisa cheating on him with their hunky scubainstructor, Claude (Hank Azaria). Broken up over a marriage that endedbefore it had a chance to begin (think Britney Spears' recent LasVegas nuptials), Reuben returns to his New York City job as a risk assessment analyst.  At a party w ith best friend Sandy (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), Reubenhas a chance encounter with junior high pal Polly Prince (JenniferAniston). Polly is a decidedly flighty eternal free spirit, and Reubenlives his life through schedules and order, but her exact oppositedisposition on life is the very thing that immediately draws himselfto her. As Reuben suffers in the name of love, going to Polly's favoriteIndian restaurants (he can't handle spicy foods) and learning salsadancing, their relationship hits its first blow with the reappearanceof Lisa, who wants a second chance. ""Along Came Polly"" is predictablemaybe more so than the norm becauseif you've seen the theatrical trailer, you've basically seen the wholemoviebut so are most films of this genre. Instead, the picture's fatalmistake is that, regardless of how energetic the cast is, the romance doesn' t work on any level. On their own, Reuben and Polly are originalenough character creations, with Reuben a by-the-book straight arrowwho assessing every possible risk in life through a percentage andPolly a joyfully disorganized gypsy who never stays in one place longenough to get bored. Together, they fit about as well as two unrelatedjigsaw puzzle pieces. While one can possibly believe Reuben mightbe attracted to Polly's liberated ways, there is no reason given forwhy Polly would even glance in Reuben's direction twice. There connectionbetween these two people is never palpably felt, nor is there anyheat or chemistry. Because of this sad fact, the romanceindeed, thewhole point of its existenceflounders miserably. What does work, and what makes the viewing experience a passable,if not worthwhile, one, is the sharp character w ork by a few of itssupporting players. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (2002's ""25th Hour"") cando no wrong, and does it again here as Sandy Lyle, a former childstar who in his adulthood has clung to the fame achieved from a solefilm appearance in a ""Breakfast Club""-style teen flick. Hoffman isat his quirky best, wavering between truthful pathos and successfulcomedic flourishes (as when, playing Judas, he takes it upon himselfto sing Jesus' empowering musical number in an off-Broadway productionof ""Jesus Christ Superstar""). As Leland, a client of Reuben's whowith every daredevil stunt he partakes in plummets his chances ofbeing insured by the company, Bryan Brown also stands out, bringinga daffy likability to a person oblivious to the danger he constantly puts himself in. As main attracti ons Reuben and Polly, Ben Stiller (2003's ""Duplex"")and Jennifer Aniston (2003's ""Bruce Almighty"") are also good, butthese frothy, undemanding parts are so beneath them it almost hurts.Stiller, a warm and funny presence with impeccable comic timing, hasbegun to repeat himself too often. And Aniston, who delivered themost powerful performance of 2002 in ""The Good Girl,"" has followedup this success with two phoned-in love interest roles. Aniston'sPolly may be a part of the film's title, but she never breaks freeof one dimension and shows no satisfying growth by the end, asidefrom what the plot has demanded she do. And Polly's consistent noncommittalattitude toward everything she does stops being endearing midway throughand becomes downright frustrating. By the conclusion, when she threatensto move away again simply because of her conflict with Reuben, youhave half a notion to slap some sense into Polly. This likely wasn'tthe response writer-director John Hamburg was going for, but thatis exactly how he has clumsily constructed this character. ""Along Came Polly"" has a few laughs, including the long-overdue definitionof what a ""shart"" is, but they come and go without a whole lot ofimpact. The film, as a whole, falls victim to the same quandary. Themachinations of the plot creak along as one cliched and unextraordinaryevent follows the next. As for the love story between Reuben and Polly,it is stillborn. There's nothing particularly terrible about ""AlongCame Polly,"" but, save for a handful of performances, nothing particularly good, either.",Along Came Polly,PG-13,2004,2.5
37,"A superior, loose sequel to 1997's lurid and silly ""Kiss the Girls,"" ""Along Came a Spider"" is a competently made thriller--well acted, tautly directed, but with more than a few ludicrous twists and plot holes. The story this time around does not revolve around a serial killer, but a vicious kidnapper, which is an admittedly refreshing change of pace from what was originally expected, and what I am used to seeing in this genre. It is ultimately the film's tight pacing that saves the day, turning what could have been a tiresome retread into an enjoyable, if unexceptional, viewing experience.  Brilliant investigator Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), the one major returning character from ""Kiss the Girls,"" has been having a rough personal time lately, unrequitedly guilt-ridden for not being able to save the life of his partner several months earlier. He is called back to work, however, when one Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), the 12-year-old daughter of a United States senator, is abducted by her teacher, Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott), while at school. Helping and guiding Alex in his desperate search is Jezzie Flanagan (Monica Potter), a secret service agent who has worked at the exclusive private school for the last two years. If anyone can possibly know why Megan was kidnapped, it is Jezzie, who has grown to know and care about all of her charges.  ""Along Came a Spider"" is riddled with far-fetched ideas and sequences, including a mad chase through the streets and metro stations of Washington, D.C. without any accuracy in where each location is placed on a real map. There is also a laughable scene in which the FBI is able to conveniently search through the kidnapper's home using only a camera and a computer that is able to zoom in on every minute detail of the room. The movie is a little silly when you stop to think about it long enough, and yet, it works in spite of its flaws.  The screenplay, by Marc Moss (based on the novel by James Patterson), and direction, by Lee Tamahori (1997's ""The Edge""), are certainly instrumental in making the picture's spare parts gel together into a satisfyingly cohesive whole, but it is Morgan Freeman who makes everything convincing. Freeman (2000's ""Nurse Betty"") is a class-act veteran, taking every character he plays so seriously that it would almost be impossible for him to turn in a bad performance. His Alex Cross is not developed much further than he was in ""Kiss the Girls,"" but it is a smart, cunning character that you cannot help but follow.  Holding her own is Monica Potter (2001's ""Head Over Heels""), a younger, blonder version of Julia Roberts, who is quickly becoming quite a stunning actress. Potter more than makes up for the absence of Ashley Judd (the heroine in the movie's predecessor), and genuinely is able to go through a spectrum of differing emotions, as she isn't sure how to react to her own failings as a guardian at the school.  Mika Boorem (2000's ""The Patriot""), as Megan Rose, is perhaps the standout in the film. Megan may be a young child, but she is a clever, intelligent, and strong individual--quite a rare feat for such a small kidnap victim in the world of feature films. Boorem is not only likable, but believable, and her role is not an easy one, either.  From the opening credits, which ingeniously consist of the words being lowered by the strings of a spider web, to the stunning prologue that depicts a horrifying automobile accident which concludes over the side of a waterfall, to the unpredictable finale, ""Along Came a Spider"" is a good movie. Judging from how strongly I disliked ""Kiss the Girls,"" it is probably better than it has any right to be. It isn't a great achievement, however. The climactic twist is undoubtedly surprising, but it also leaves several unanswered questions, and almost feels like a betrayal. You'll know what I mean when you see it. Suffice to say, amidst its downfalls, the ending is much like the entire movie in general: not completely agreeable, but nonetheless, it manages to somehow remain a strong entertainment. ",Along Came a Spider,R,2001,3
38," With a high-powered, A-list cast that features no less than Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal, and Christopher Walken, the chance that ""America's Sweethearts,"" a satirical view of Hollywood with a little romance thrown in for good measure, would be a failure seemed slim to none. Thanks to director Joe Roth's aimless direction, and Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan's unimpressive, personality-deprived screenplay, the unthinkable has happened. ""America's Sweethearts"" is a dull-witted, utterly slight comedy that, dare I say, is boring from one end to the other.   Set over one weekend at a Las Vegas desert-set press junket, big-screen actors and married couple Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) and Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) have come to promote their eighth picture together, entitled ""Time Over Time."" With Gwen's last two Eddie-less films bombing in the states, a lot is riding on the success of ""Time Over Time"" to boost both of their careers. Only one problem stands in the way of a peaceful weekend of joint promotion; Eddie and Gwen have split up and are currently not even speaking to each other.   Enter Lee (Billy Crystal), a studio publicist who has been hired to reconcile Eddie and Gwen's relationship, or, at the very least, make it seem to the press that they are still getting along. This task won't be an easy one; Eddie is in a state of depression, and still believes he is in love, while Gwen has taken up with a Spanish lothario named Hector (Hank Azaria). Further complicating matters, Gwen's sister and personal assistant, Kiki (Julia Roberts), has secret longings of her own for Eddie.   If ""America's Sweethearts"" wants to take a ruthless, sharp jab at the Hollywood industry, it is far too soft around the edges and lacks the wit needed to accomplish such a task. If it wants to make a statement about famous marriages and the press surrounding celebrities, the same idea was put to far better use, and was infinitely more telling, in 1999's ""Notting Hill,"" also starring Roberts. If it wants to be a screwball comedy in the tradition of Preston Sturges, it hasn't the energy to even get off the ground running. And, finally, if it wants to be a romance between Eddie and Kiki, I've seen more sparks fly between ostriches.   Watching ""America's Sweethearts"" is a disheartening experience. It starts off slowly, has a middle that creeps along at the speed of an asthmatic octogenarian, and finishes up with a conclusion that is neither gratifying nor inspiring. While a few winning moments sneak in throughout (Roberts' distressed Kiki, formerly sixty pounds heavier, falls off the wagon and digs into a breakfast big enough for the entire salvation army), they are only fleeting glimpses of what might have been had the screenplay gone through some major rewrites. Not helping matters are a collection of characters (excluding the mousy Kiki) who are self-involved, uninteresting, and not nice. Who wants to watch a film--one that attempts to be a romantic comedy, no less--when you can't even stand to be around the participants?   Julia Roberts (2000's Oscar winner for ""Erin Brockovich"") isn't the world's most popular actress for nothing. She injects life into the slimmest of parts, and ""America's Sweethearts"" offers her her most thankless role since 1991's ""Hook."" While Roberts' Kiki is the sole likable presence, as she gradually learns to stand up for herself, she is underwritten and not terribly engaging. Almost every scene that does work includes Roberts, however, whether she be stuffing her face with breakfast, blowing up at the vacant idiocy of Gwen and Eddie, or sharing a tender moment with Eddie in a flashback that finds her equipped with a pudgy face and a fat suit (read: a normal, American body).   John Cusack (2000's ""High Fidelity"") and Catherine Zeta-Jones (2000's ""Traffic""),as title couple Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison, are far above their roles. Cusack, good in just about everything, must resort to jokes about falling on the spines of a cactus to get laughs. Zeta-Jones plays the pampered actress to a hilt, but the sheer phoniness of her character does nothing in the way of making her an attractive presence. Billy Crystal (1999's ""Analyze This""), as the determined, smarmy Lee, has one good gag involving a Doberman attracted to his crotch, but might as well not have even been present for the rest of the picture. In minor roles, Christopher Walken (2001's ""Joe Dirt""), as the maniacal director of ""Time Over Time;"" Hank Azaria (1999's ""Cradle Will Rock""), as Gwen's flamboyant new flame; Stanley Tucci (2000's ""Joe Gould's Secret""), as the head of the production studio; and Seth Green (2001's ""Josie and the Pussycats""), as Lee's eager, but clueless, assistant, have little to do.   ""America's Sweethearts"" squanders so badly because it fails to uphold the courage of its convictions. Something is definitely off about the whole enterprise. Where it should be a lethally funny attack at the cliches of the Hollywood system, it holds no true insight or daring. And where it should be a cute romance, it is--for lack of a better word--sterile. Director Joe Roth may be the head of the promising new studio, Revolution Films, but as the one in charge of ""America's Sweethearts,"" he has wasted the talents of a large bevy of people who probably should have known better in the first place.  ",America's Sweethearts,PG-13,2001,2
39,"David Mamet is one of the most brilliant of today's playwrightsand screenwriters.  His scripts for the movies include VANYA ON 42NDSTREET, HOFFA, HOMICIDE, THINGS CHANGE, THE UNTOUCHABLES, THE VERDICT,and THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE.  There are also several plays ofhis for which he wrote the movie scripts including OLEANNA, ABOUT LASTNIGHT, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, and HOUSE OF GAMES.  The last two films areincredible tours de force and put him at the top of my list for writersworth looking for.  His scripts are highly intelligent with every lineworth pondering, and his characters engage each other with constantverbal ripostes.       One of his classic and early plays, AMERICAN BUFFALO, has not beenmade into a movie until now.  Producer Gregory Mosher got playwrightand one time director Michael Corrente (FEDERAL HILL) to directAMERICAN BUFFALO.  They wanted Dustin Hoffman to play the lead in thisthree man play, but at first he turned them down.  As Hoffman tells thestory in the press kit, ""Michael told me he felt there were three greatmale roles in the American Theater: Stanley in 'A Streetcar NamedDesire;' Willy Loman in 'Death of a Salesman;' and Teach in AMERICANBUFFALO. ...  I recalled that twenty years ago I heard from anothercrazy Italian filmmaker about a cab driver in New York, and I didn'tpay much attention to it.""  He finally took the role of Teach, thesmall time gambler, crook, and general lowlife.       As Hoffman's costar, they got Dennis Franz from the TV series""NYPD Blues"" to play the junk store owner and fellow crook Donny.  Inthe only other role in the film they cast Sean Nelson (FRESH) as thewannabe burglar Bobby.       Most of Mamet's plays that are made into movies do not feel likeplays, but AMERICAN BUFFALO has all of the claustrophobia of a play.All of the action takes place in or just outside Donny's junk shop cumantique store.       Teach tells us that, ""If I had kept everything my old man threwout, I'd be a wealthy man today.""  Well, Donny's store seems to bewhere all the stuff from our childhood went, but he isn't making muchmoney so he spends his waking hours gambling with Teach and his otherfriends and trying to figure out ways to rise cash through pettythievery.       As Donny relates to Teach, a man came into his shop and paid $90for a Buffalo nickel that Donny thought was worthless.  Eventually,Donny becomes convinced that this guy is a big time coin dealer whomust have a fortune in coins in his house.  Donny decides to pin hishopes on his young and inexperienced protege Bobby as the person tobreak in and steal the loot.       Teach is aghast at this decision since he wants to be cut in onthe action.  Outraged, he argues with Donny, ""All I'm saying is don'tconfuse business with pleasure.""  He goes on to say that, ""Loyalty isfine, but this is business.""       Most of the show has the two would be rich con men arguing abouthow the crime will be pulled off.  Typical of these is the discussionabout where the theoretical coins are hidden.  Most of their logic isfull of wild and changing suppositions, but they squabble with greatferocity.       Teach is the cynical philosopher of play.  As their plans andfriendship begins to disintegrate in front of their eyes, he musesthat, ""The world is lies.  There is no friendship.""  He says, ""We livelike the cavemen.""  In one of his summations toward the end, hedeclares, ""I go out there everyday.  There is nothing out there.""       All of the people give fine performances.  Hoffman says of hischaracter that, ""On the surface, Teach is an ineffective, pettycriminal, but what is intriguing is the unexpected vulnerability andcomplexity he reveals.""  Here is where I begin to have problems withthe film and where I find it one of my least favorite, albeit stillexcellent, works of Mamet's.       The Teach character as written by Mamet and played by Hoffman iscertainly intense, but not especially complex.  In fact, the mainfailing of the film is that too often it becomes tedious and littlemore than a mechanism for delivering some admittedly fine lines.       Whereas all of Mamet's other work are highly involving, this oneis too distant and self-indulgent.  I do think it is an excellentmovie, but for someone who has delivered so much better, I left thescreening feeling disappointed.  I had expected more.       AMERICAN BUFFALO runs just 1:28.  It is rated R for frequent badlanguage.  The language was natural for the characters and never usedto shock so I had no problem with it.  The film should be fine for anyteenager.  Flaws and all, the film is excellent, and I recommend it andgive it ***. ",American Buffalo,R,1996,3
40,"      My wife rented one of her favorite old movies for us to watchagain, the 1984 comedy and fantasy called AMERICAN DREAMER.  If youlike romantic fairy tales and light hearted comedies, then you may findthis is the simple sort of fable perfect for a rainy day.       Cathy Palmer (JoBeth Williams) is a housewife and would be writer.Her favorite books are the Rebecca Ryan series.  Rebecca is a brilliantinternational spy who is fluent in five languages and is a martial artsmaster.  Cathy dreams of being Rebecca.  Who among us has had notsimilar dreams?       One day she enters a writing contest where the author who writesin a style closest to that of the Rebecca Ryan novels will win a tripto Paris where Rebecca is based.  Cathy wins, but her controllinghusband Kevin (James Staley), who claims he is too busy at work to joinher, informs her ""It would be selfish, childish and irresponsible togo, but I'm not going to tell you not to go.  I'm going to leave thatdecision up to you.""       Her husband is a cliche, but this is a comedy.  When they arelaying in bed at night, she wants to make love, but he says he has""accounts,"" and so at first he declines.  He has their bed litteredwith his paperwork (""accounts"") from the office.  He even has anelectric pencil sharpener beside him so that he can grind up a freshone without leaving their bed.       Needless to say, she ignores her husband and heads off by herselfto Paris.  Once there she has a feeling of genuine exhilaration withher new success and independence.  The fun starts when she gets hit onthe head in an accident.  When she wakes up, you guessed it, she isconvinced that she is Rebecca Ryan.       She tells people at the Embassy ball in Paris that, ""I'm RebeccaRyan, and I can drink any man here under the table.""  She does.  Sheeven quotes Nietzsche (""What doesn't destroy me makes me stronger"") inthe original German to the people she meets.  The show gets reallyloony at this point, but Williams plays the role with great panache andwith her good sense of comedic timing pulls it off brilliantly.  I lovewatching Williams.  Makes you want to go live your dreams.       Along the way she meets people whom she is convinced are othercharacters from the novels.  Chief among these is Victor Marchand (TomConti).  Conti, who was good during this period of his acting career,is sweet here.  His main purpose is to be a foil to Williams.       AMERICAN DREAMER was directed by Rick Rosenthal and written byDavid Greenwalt and Jim Kouf based on a story by Ann Biderman.  Thescript is lighted hearted and funny, and the director's pacing is zany.The success of the show, however, should be credited to Williams.Comedy is a personal taste, and for me this show is a fun romp.       AMERICAN DREAMER runs about an hour and a half.  It is rated PGfor reasons of which I am not quite sure.  There is no sex, nudity,violence or bad language.  It would be fine for any kid old enough tobe interested in a comedy featuring adults.  I recommend this littlepicture to you and give it ***. ",American Dreamer,PG,1984,3
41,"Last few years it became very fashionable to portray 1970sas the Golden Age. People that actually had to live in thatparticular period had somewhat different perspective. In theGloomy Decade lamentation over kinder and gentler past wasquite fashionable. In 1973 George Lucas, young and unknownfilm director at the time, was one of the first to profit onsuch feeling of nostalgia. His semi-autobiographical dramaAMERICAN GRAFFITI, shot in four weeks with small budget,turned out to be one of the most popular, and therefore,most profitable films of the year. Financial success,critical praise and ""Oscar"" nominations later allowed Lucasto engage in the next and even more successful project -STAR WARS.  The plot takes place in Modesto, small town in NorthernCalifornia during one night in summer of 1962. CurtHenderson (played by Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve Bolander(played by Ron Howard) are two high school graduates who areabout to travel back East next morning in order to enrol incollege. Two of them have different views on their immediatefuture - Curt has some second thoughts about leavingfriends, familiar settings and carefree teenager lifestyle;Steve is, on the other hand, quite adamant about going tocollege, even if it jeopardises relationship with his longtime girlfriend and Steve's sister Laurie (played by CindyWilliams). Steve, while trying to settle things with Laurie,borrows his expensive car to Terry ""The Toad"" Fields (playedby Charles Martin Smith), nerdy friend who would use thatmachine to cruise the town's strip and pick beautiful blondeDebbie Dunham (played by Candy Clark). John Milner (playedby Paul Le Mat), the oldest of the bunch, has quite anotherproblem - during the course of his nightly cruise, he wastricked into babysitting obnoxious 13-year old brat Carol(played by Mackenzie Phillips), and while he tries to dumpher, new hotrod driver Bob Falfa (played by Harrison Ford)challenges Milner's title of local drag race king.  AMERICAN GRAFFITI is often cited not only as one of the best1970s, but also one of the best American films of thiscentury. On the other hand, its current popularity wasperpetuated, at least partially, by the later success ofSTAR WARS and instant name recognition of its creator.Overrated or not, AMERICAN GRAFFITI is a fine piece offilmmaking. It has anything a good period film should have-costumes, hairstyles, cars and other details characteristicfor the early 1960s, all shot by a good photography by HarryWexler (although some scenes look too dark at times). Theperiod atmosphere is also brought by almost semi-documentarystyle in which Lucas shows us fast food restaurants, driveins, high school dances, night cruising, drag races andother social customs of that era. The characters are wellwritten and played by a great ensemble cast of young andunknown actors who would later (at least in most of thecases) enjoy respectable careers, including Harrison Ford ina small but very uncharacteristic role of villain. The musicis not original, but great nevertheless, with an excellentcollection of late 1950s and early 1960s songs that playalmost non-stop, followed by the voice of Wolfman Jack,legendary DJ of the period who appears in a small butmemorable cameo role in the film.  However, this film, despite being very good, lost part ofits initial appeal through the passage of time. Some of theflaws in the script by George Lucas and Gloria Katz arebecoming more transparent - like the lack of coherent plotand adequate closure. Many situations and character typesbecame overused in multitude in later films that covered thesame period, turning AMERICAN GRAFFITI in large collectionof cliches and stereotypes. And even its message of growingup and facing the world seems less universal than Lucaswants to admit. Those who would understand this film themost are still those who used to grow up in nearly fairytaleworld of post-WW2 American prosperity and whose illusionsgot shattered by Kennedy assassination, Vietnam and greatsocial turmoil that followed those traumatic events. Theothers would probably have different perspective on thisfilm, but AMERICAN GRAFFITI still bears the mark of a superbfilmmaking talent. ",American Graffiti,PG,1973,3
42," Hey, break open a keg.  The gang's all here.  In James B. Rogers's AMERICAN PIE2, it's a year later, and everyone has just finished their first year ofcollege.  So that they can make it a summer to remember, the guys, Jim (JasonBiggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas)and, most of all, Stifler (Seann William Scott), whose irreverent smart mouthmakes the movie, have rented a beachfront house.  In order to remind us of the bawdy incidents that we loved from the first movie,writer Adam Herz begins with a lot of not so subtle references to the original,which the audience laps up.  Although no pie is harmed in the making of thismovie, you can be sure that Jim will have another encounter that he won't soonforget or be able to live down.  As soon as you see the cause of his troublesthis time, you'll guess what will happen, but that will in no way detract fromyour enjoyment of the results.  Actually, the two most memorable scenes inAMERICAN PIE 2 are centered on Stifler.  One is based on champagne, and anotherinvolves men's fantasy of homosexuality -- but only among women.    The director and the editor (Larry Madaras) seem to make just the right choicesin knowing how long to stay with a scene and when to cut away.  The movie itselffeels like a compendium of the best episodes from an entire season of a raunchycable sitcom.  Not much has changed from when we last saw our studs and would-be studs.  Jimworries, correctly, about how bad he is in bed.  Jim pines for the voluptuousNadia (Shannon Elizabeth), but it is band nerd Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) towhom he goes to for sexual advice.    Oz has a thing only for Heather (Mena Suvari), who is inconveniently abroad. This leaves them with one almost successful phone sex scene and not much else todo in the movie.  Finch is in training to be the world's greatest lover to his goddess, Stifler'sMom (Jennifer Coolidge).   And Kevin wants only the unobtainable Vicky (TaraReid).  They settle by agreeing to be ""friends.""  Among the story's many gems is the ""Rule of 3.""  Take the number of women that aman claims to have slept with and divide the number by three.  For women, theoperation is multiplication rather than division.    AMERICAN PIE 2 has some large laughs but not many genuine surprises.  Onesurprise, however, is that it can sometimes be as sweet as it is funny.  Thebest example of this occurs when Michelle tries as hard as she can to teach Jimthe finer points of love making.  As she put its succinctly, ""You've got topreheat the oven before you stick in the turkey.""  Michelle is the type of girlthat every guy wishes had lived next-door when they were growing up.  It's not ablonde bombshell that guys want.  It's an understanding female to show them thereal ways of romance.  Michelle provides that charmingly for Jim.  AMERICAN PIE 2 runs 1:40.  It is rated R for strong sexual content, crude humor,language and drinking and would be acceptable for older teenagers. ",American Pie 2,R,2001,3
43,"      THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is as topical as today's headlines.  Whatsubjects are more in the news than President Clinton's reelection andsingle parents?  Well, in this comedy we get both.  The names have beenchanged to protect the innocent as they say, but the movie leaves nodoubt that this is a movie that asks the question, what would it belike if today the president was single because his wife had died ofcancer during the 1992 campaign?       In director Rob Reiner's THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT it is the thirdyear of the first term of 49 year old Democratic president AndrewShepherd (Michael Douglas).  Just like William (Bill) Clinton, he goesby a nickname, Andy.  His opponent in the campaign is the conservativeRepublican and Senate majority leader, Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss).Not only is Dreyfuss made to resemble Bob Dole, he even representsKansas as well.  Playing the Chelsea role is another 12 year old girl,Lucy Shepherd (Shawna Waldron).  As senior policy advisor GeorgeStephanopoulos, we have a short actor with a lot of hair and a temperjust like him, Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox).  See the documentaryTHE WAR ROOM if you want to see the real Stephanopoulos in action.       The parallels go on and on.  Here the president is not sure whathe is for other than getting good poll numbers and being reelected.The moral of the show, of course, is that he discovers his values andfinds his missing backbone, much as a paleontologist might discover anew dinosaur.  The Republicans in the movie are only interested inslinging mud, they met in smoke filled paneled rooms where they smokebig cigars, and they talk like devils.  The Democrats, on the otherhand, have a handsome and charismatic leader, and they are out to savethe planet with bills on global warming.  Were life so clear, we couldgive up on elections and turn the government over to the Democrats inperpetuity.  It is this part of the show that I found very tiring.They could have made a show about a single president trying to getreelected, without the Clinton family and his advisor look-alikes, andit would have been better.       When I was able to ignore the pedantic political messages, I founda movie that was hilarious.  It has been a long time since I laughed somuch.  The script by Aaron Sorkin has one great line after another.When environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) firstmeets the president, he overhears her describing him as thinking he is""the chief executive of Fantasyland.""  Rather than hating her, he fallsin love with love.  When he calls her on the phone for a date to astate dinner, she hangs up on him not believing he is the president.This is one of many scenes that had me rolling in the aisles withlaughter.  When he calls her back, she does not know what to say, andhe complains to her that, ""Congress doesn't take this long to decide.""       Douglas and Bening are both wonderful in the movie.  Andy is everywoman's dream date, an extremely handsome man who is the most powerfulman in the world and who is tender and charismatic at the same time.While wooing her, he tells her that ""The White House is the singlegreatest home court advantage in the modern world.""  Sydney isbeautiful, charming, bright, and even allows as how she makes moremoney than he does, hence she represents every man's dream date.  Thechemistry between them is strong and believable in every scene.  Attheir first date, he asks her, ""how am I doing so far?""  As theflashbulbs go off in the state dinner procession, she answers, ""justyour typical first date.""  I do hope the writer gets an the AcademyAward nomination.       There is a great series of scenes where the president attempts toorder flowers himself.  His finds his credit cards are locked instorage in Wisconsin, and no one on the phone will believe he is thepresident anyway.  In my favorite scene in the show, the president'slong motorcade, stops in front of Carmen's Florist Shop where he popsin to buy flowers causing the woman cashier inside to faint.  This is asight gag that really works.  The length of that motorcade and theimage of it stopping in the snow for the president to buy flowers forhis girlfriend is extremely funny.  The excellent cinematography byJohn Seale has this scene in steel blues and shadows rather than therich, rosy, and almost regal colors of the rest of the movie.       The lush music by Marc Shaiman is extremely dramatic and romantic.While the president is walking along making small talk, the musicreinforces his power reminding the audience that everything thepresident does is important.  The sets by Lilly Kilvert show themajesty of the presidency while still giving it many human touches.The costumes by Gloria Gresham again reinforce this duality.       His pollsters and advisors want to know how he is going to dealwith the ""Sydney issue.""  The media keeps a count and has news storieslike ""day 15 of the Sydney watch.""  Meanwhile, Sydney gets to go onsome terrific dates at places like Camp David where she channel surfswith the president looking for the basketball scores.       The movie is full of great minor characters like Sydney's bottomline boss, Leo Solomon (John Mahoney).  One of my favorite minor rolesis Martin Sheen as A. J. MacInerney, the president's chief of staff.He is as hard as nails and super loyal.  He does not care what thepresident stands or does just so long as he gets reelected.  He wantsto rent some women surreptitiously for the president so that Andy candrop Sydney and boost his sinking poll numbers.       The first assistant director of the movie is Frank Capra III.There is a reference to the movies of his grandfather.  Clearly Reinerintends the movie as sort of a homage to Capra, and the parallels arestrong.       Finally, in a scene that shows how out of touch people in theWhite House can be, the president's pollster, Leon Kodak (DavidPaymer), at a Christmas party says ""It's Christmas"" to Lewis.Dumbfounded, Lewis asks, ""It's Christmas?"".  Leon retorts, ""You didn'tget the memo?""       THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT runs a fast 1:55.  It is rated PG-13 for atiny bit of bad language and for references to sex.  There is no nudityor violence.  I would have rated it PG, and it would be fine for anykid older than say eight.  Other than the heavy one sided politicalmessages, I loved the show and recommend it to everyone looking for agood time at the movies.  It gets *** in my book and without theunnecessary political indoctrination, I could have given it anotherhalf star. ","American President, The",PG-13,1995,3
44,"The collective luck of Jim, Michelle, Stifler, Finch, Kevin, and thefilmmakers has finally run out with ""American Wedding,"" the thirdinstallment of 1999's ""American Pie"" and 2001's ""American Pie 2.""Whereas its predecessors effortlessly blended outrageous and raunchycomedy with an unden iable truth and sweetness, the humor in ""AmericanWedding"" is more often uneven than not and its serious moments lessconvincing and real. Written by Adam Herz as if he was more won overby his salary than a genuine passion for the story he was telling,the film is ultimately burdened by this very notiona distinct feelingof nothing more than obligation for all involved. Why the movie wasn't simply called ""American Pie 3"" is anyone's guess,even if the new title says it all. Upon graduation from college, niceguy Jim (Jason Biggs) digs up the courage to propose to long-time,former band camper girlfriend Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). When sheaccepts, the extended wedding plans begin, with Jim seeking the aidof best friends Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)to ensure that everything goes off without a hitch. It doesn't, ofcourse, especially when self-involved horn-dog Stifler (Seann WilliamScott) catches wind of the marriage plans and attempts to romanceMichelle's beautiful younger sister, Cadence (January Jones). If the high school-set ""American Pie"" set up characters we grew tolove, and the college-themed ""American Pie 2"" continued their naturalprogression with a surefire accuracy, then ""American Wedding"" neverfeels like anything more than tacked-on. Post-college marriage iscertainly the next step in these characters' lives, but the writingthis time isn't nearly as sharp or witty, and most of its charactershave ridiculously little to do. In fact, past cast regulars ChrisKlein, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, and Natasha Lyonneare not only nowhere to be found, but aside from one passing exception,are never even mentioned. This is not only a disappointment to theseries fans who have invested into all of the characters, but it islazy on screenwriter Herz's pa rt. Their absence is strongly felt. ""American Wedding"" does try to follow the formula that worked forits precursors, but by now, that formula is getting notably stale.For the most part, the jokes arrive out of necessity rather than throughnaturalism, even if several set-pieces are quite funny. Jim and Stifler'srun-in with a wedding cake and two dogs is a comic highlight, theculmination of its setup ribticklingly ballsy, while a bachelor partygone awry reminds of a superbly edited screwball comedy. Less successfulis Stifler's dance-off in a gay bar and Jim's untimely decision to shave his pubic hair. The center of the film is, inevitably, the wedding, yet Jim and Michelleare pushed aside in favor of countless Stifler antics. Jason Biggsand Alyson Hannigan made a wonderfully charismatic team in the previoustwo features, but here share too few scenes together to be lastinglyeffective. Hannigan's Michelle, the best thing about the series, hasbeen softened to the p oint of rarely being given a good one-lineror character scene. Mostly, she stays in the backgroundsomething Michellenever did in the first two. Hannigan is an excellent actress, severelyunderrated, and she deserves better. For that matter, so does ThomasIan Nicholas (2002's ""Halloween: Resurrection""), given nothing satisfactoryto do as Kevin. The biggest flaw on director Jesse Dylan's (2001's ""How High"") partis in handing over lead role duties to Seann William Scott (2003's""Bulletproof Monk""), as Stifler. Scott, another standout of the firsttwo movies with his showy supporting part, wears out his welcome quickas the lead, and hasn't smoothly drifted back into Stifler's shoes.Something feels very off about Scott's performance here, and his facialexpressions sometimes border on creepy when that clearly wasn't theactor's intention. What does work is his romance with Michelle's free-thinkingsis, Cadence. January Jones (2003's ""Anger Management"") makes fora bright, earthy counterpart to the more out-there Stifler. Also makingrequisite appearances are Eugene Levy (2003's ""A Mighty Wind"") asJim's faithful dad, and the invaluable Jennifer Coolidge (2003's ""LegallyBlonde 2"") as Stifler's Mom. ""American Pie"" and ""American Pie 2"" blended smoothly together, a beautifullycrafted rites of passage duo that were always funny, but not afraidto remain honest about friendships and romance. In comparison, ""AmericanWeddin g"" feels tired and empty, a motion picture with a handful offine moments surrounded by one missed opportunity after the next.And despite Jim and Michelle's climactic dance to The Wallflowers'cover of ""Into the Mystic"" recapturing the pure magic of their lovingrelationship, it does not excuse the fact that they are otherwiseshortchanged throughout. Making Stifler the star was a bad idea; aloud and over-the-top creation like him is perfect for a supportingrole, but grates on the nerves when onscreen for longer portions.It doesn't take a rocket scientist (or a pie fornicator) to tell that""American Wedding"" is easily the weakest in a once-promising series.",American Wedding,R,2003,2.5
45,"The author of this review, while being introduced to thephenomenon called ""straight-to-video"" in the early 1990,made an interesting observation. It dealt with the trailersof the ""straight-to-video"" movies. The good trailers usuallymeant bad or unwatchable movies. The trailer for AMERICANYAKUZA, 1993 action film by Nick A. Capello, was one of thebetter ones. But the movie itself was one of the rareexceptions to the rule above; it was surprisingly good andit delivered the goods promised in the trailer.  The plot of this movie, based on the screenplay by JohnAllen Nelson and Max Strom, uses the very same Americanphobias as much more spectacular (and less successful)RISING SUN - phobias based on the great success of Japaneseeconomy in 1980s and the infiltration of Japanese capitalinto American mainland. But in order for this film to haveattractive ""straight-to-video"" potential, the Japaneseinvasion of USA happens in the form of yakuzas - Japanesecrime organisations that are taking over lucrative crimebusinesses from the locals like Mafia. Of course, that leadsto the series of bloody conflicts and one of the peoplecaught in the crossfire is Nick Davis (played by ViggoMortensen), convict recently released from prison. Hehappens to be in the right place and the right time andsaves the life of an important yakuza. Yakuza reward him byemploying his services and he gradually begins to get theirtrust and friendship. Of course, they don't know that Davisis undercover FBI agent, now torn between his official dutyand the loyalty he feels towards his new friends.  Although the screenplay seems rather weak excuse for theseries of standard action scenes, the writers should becommended because very few of them would use the form of anaction movie to preach multiculturalism, like Nelson andStrom do. Of course, the plot is full of simplifications andsometimes not very plausible events, like in manystraight-to-video films. But AMERICAN YAKUZA still has avery good impact, because the direction by Nick A. Capello,very MTV-like style (few years before that style becamefashionable), reminds the viewers of John Woo's Hong Kongfilms. The music by David C. Williams is also very good. Butthe most impressive element of the film is Viggo Mortensen,one of the most capable American character actors, here in avery unusual role of an action lead - tough, but sensitiveman with a hidden agenda. AMERICAN YAKUZA is still alow-budget action film in its essence, but the talent of itsmakers managed to cross the barriers of such genredesignation. ",American Yakuza,R,1994,2
46,"      As the abolitionists kneel in prayer and song before the jail, theAfrican slaves imprisoned inside cannot figure out what to make of thisweird group.  At first they think these strange people prostratingbefore them are sick, but then they decide that they must beentertainers.  But why are the entertainers all so sad?       AMISTAD is Steven Spielberg's earnest movie based on a true storyof a group of Africans who in 1839 revolted and commandeered the slaveship (La Amistad) upon which they were being transported.  With thefilm, Spielberg boldly comes out foursquare against slavery -- not avery controversial or original idea.       Although Spielberg devises many powerful scenes for the movie, hisstaging confuses more often than it enlightens.  When the slaves speak,for example, we frequently do not get English subtitles, but when theircaptors speak in Spanish, we get their every word translated.       Told by a host of known actors, almost all white, the overly longmovie never takes the time to develop more than the one slave -- JosephCinque (Djimon Hounsou) -- into a real character.  The other slavesmake up a large faceless mass.  With over two and a half hours ofmovie, in which Spielberg devotes time to incidents as small as youngQueen Isabella of Spain (Anna Paquin) jumping up and down on her bed,why we couldn't hear from more than one slave remains a mystery.       In ROSEWOOD, a much better film from earlier this year, we heardfrom a wide variety of African-Americans, which made their plight realand vivid.  Why did Spielberg feel he needed to devote so much moneyand screen time to a group of known actors (Anthony Hopkins, MatthewMcConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, Stellan Skarsgard, AnnaPaquin, David Paymer and Arliss Howard among others) as the peopleaiding the slaves and then create only a single decent part (Cinque)for the slaves themselves?  How effective would SHINDLER'S LIST havebeen if only the Nazis and the Allies got parts, but the Jews wererelegated to a single character?       After the slaves revolt in AMISTAD, they are tricked into sailingto America, thinking it is Africa.  Once near the shore they werecaptured by an American naval ship and taken in for trial.       The case itself has many intricacies, both in the number oflitigants and in the strategy of the slaves' defense attorney.  MatthewMcConaughey plays Roger Baldwin, the slaves' tricky but effectivelawyer.  Several groups sue for ownership of the slaves, but the scriptnever takes the time to explore the issues as effectively as it should.Instead, we get a Cliff's Notes-style outline of the case plus a fewrandom scenes of the trials.       When Spielberg should be storytelling, too often we get theatricsinstead.  Cinque, for example, bursts out in the middle of their trialand starts speaking for the first time in English.  ""Give us free,"" heshouts repeatedly, thereby bringing the trial to a complete standstill.Rather than anyone trying to repress the outbursts of the prisoner,everyone stares in awe at him as the music contains somethingapproaching the sounds of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir raising a loudvoice to heaven.       Morgan Freeman and Stellan Skarsgard play Joadson and Tappan, thetwo abolitionists who hire Baldwin.  Freeman gets little dialog and isbasically wasted in the movie.  But then, most of the characters in thefilm exist mainly in caricature.  Tappan, for example, is the canonicaldo-gooder who is perfectly willing to let others die for his cause.""They may be of more value to our cause in death than in life,"" Tappanexplains to Baldwin.       Nigel Hawthorne repeats his Academy Award nominated role of GeorgeIII, except this time his character is addressed as President MartinVan Buren.       The best performance in the picture, and the only one with anydepth, is given by Anthony Hopkins as the semi-senile, ex-presidentJohn Quincy Adams.  Adams comes into the story mainly at the last as heargues the slaves' case in front of the Supreme Court.  ""We've come tounderstand that who we are is who we were,"" he orates in his moving andcomplicated address to the court.       Even given the film's ponderous pacing, the slaves' story doescome out.  We see extremely gory pictures of naked people being beatento death as their blood splatters everyone nearby, and we see nakedhuman beings chained together, attached to a weight and thrown to theirdeaths in the ocean.       ""Whoever tells the best story wins,"" is Adams's advice on how bestto conduct the trial.  Spielberg should have listened.  All in all,AMISTAD is an excellent story, poorly told.       AMISTAD runs 2:37.  It is rated R for gore, nudity and maturethemes, and would be fine for teenagers who can handle gruesome images. ",Amistad,R,1997,2.5
47,"""It was the summer of 1965,"" Suzanne (Scarlett Johansson, GHOST WORLD) tellsus as the story opens on a picturesque Hungarian bridge on the wrong side ofthe Iron Curtain.  ""I was fifteen, and my life was falling apart.""  For mostkids, one set of parents is plenty, sometimes more than enough.  All of herlife Suzanne has had the blessing and the curse of having two sets ofparents, who live a world apart.  It is never quite clear which ones aremore her ""real"" parents, her biological ones or her foster ones.  In thistrue story, both have profound love for her.   There are plenty of movies that generate laughter, as this one will too onoccasion, but few that cause you to cry as you will listening to Suzanne'spoignant story.  Too often movies that try to pack an emotional wallop justcome across as cheap and maudlin.  Not AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY, an honest dramathat touches your heart.  The picture is a labor of love by long-time editorÄva Gàrdos (AGNES BROWN) in an incredibly accomplished debut as writer anddirector.  Just like Suzanne, Gàrdos escaped Communist Hungary thanks to theefforts of the Red Cross.   After the opening sequence, we jump to the past when Suzanne is just a baby.Her parents, Margit and Peter, played in powerful yet understatedperformances by Nastassja Kinski and Tony Goldwyn, are about to risk theirlives in a daring escape attempt across a heavily mined and guarded border.Her sister is just barely old enough to accompany them, but they can't takea baby.  They have a separate scheme to smuggle Suzanne across, but it goesawry.  The net result is that Suzanne is left with a kind and loving familywho live on a remote Hungarian farm, while the rest of her immediate familyis off to America to make a new life for themselves while exhausting everypossible avenue to get their daughter returned to them. The episodic movie covers the events when Suzanne is a baby as well as atage three, six and fifteen.  The longest portions are at six and at fifteen.The actor who steals the movie is a real find, newcomer KellyEndresz-Banlaki, a snaggletoothed charmer who plays the key role of Suzanneat age six, when the girl is first confronted with the reality of having twosets of parents, both wanting her to be with them.  The scenes of her at herHungarian farm home reminds us of how wonderful home can be, wherever it islocated.  Home is where the heart is, and Suzanne's home is about to change,which causes understandable trauma to her heart.  There are so many waysthis key transition point in the story could have gone wrong, but underGàrdos's capable hands and with Endresz-Banlaki's delightful acting, itdoesn't miss a step. From there the story works its way from an innocent little girl seeingtelevision for the first time to an angst-filled teen with raging hormones.  The movie has some of the most impressive cinematography (Elem_r Ragàlyi,JACOB THE LIAR) of the year.  From a rich Technicolor look that mimicsmovies of the period to intriguing black-and-white flashback sequences, itis hard to pick out a visual favorite.  The set designers (Alex Tavoularisand Stephanie Ziemer) and the costumers (Beatrix Aruna Pasztor and VanessaVogel) work hard to get the look authentic without overwhelming us withkitsch.  The 60s, in particularly, is a hard era to recreate withoutproducing parody.   There's a lot more in this rich narrative that I haven't mentioned from thematernal grandmother's plight in prison to the mother-daughter conflict of arebellious teen and an overprotective mother, who is dead set on neverlosing her daughter again.  Is there anything I would change?  Not much.I'd lose the boy on the bike with the big American flag, which was a littletoo clich_d even if it did provide a nice two-second visual.  If you leavehappily teary eyed, don't be surprised.  But don't worry, you'll won't feelmanipulated.   AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY runs a nearly perfect length at 1:43.  It is ratedPG-13 for ""some violent content and thematic material,"" and would beacceptable for any kid old enough to be interested in such serious stories.",An American Rhapsody,PG-13,2001,3.5

And so does the film ANACONDA -- rightafter the opening credits.       Luckily for Jennifer Lopez, she had a tremendous hit, SELENA,before ANACONDA was released, because this grade B movie with grade Aspecial effects could do serious damage to the career of a newer actor.       Okay, let's set the cast for our cruise down the Amazon.Jennifer Lopez plays our bumfuzzled documentary director, who managesto look alluring and keep on her make-up no matter how hot and humidthe climate.       Giving the only respectable acting performance in the show, HipHopper and actor Ice Cube plays the documentary cameraman.   As the onecredible character on the boat, the audience can use his part as astandard to judge the degree of ridiculousness of the others.       Owen Wilson (BOTTLE ROCKET) ostensibly plays Gary, the soundmixer, but actually his is the classical role of the gullible blondewho has good looks but little brains.   He gets some asinine lines,including my favorite, ""Is it just me or does the jungle make youreally, really horny?""  Yes, our titillating script makes you thinkthat sex, just like the monster, is just around the corner.   KariSalin plays Denise Kalber, whose main role in the film is that ofsomeone for Gary to ogle.       Eric Stoltz briefly appears as the anthropologist Dr.  StevenCale.   Shakespearean actor Jonathan Hyde is cast as the documentary'snarrator Warren Westridge.   Warren, the quintessential twit, drinkshis white wine from his personal crystal goblet while floating down theAmazon in a beat-up barge.   Danny Trejo plays Poacher, the captain ofthe ill-fated boat.       Jon Voight, who was so brilliant in ROSEWOOD, returns to his oldhabit of picking miserable material.   In ANACONDA, he plays PaulSarone, the Captain Ahab of the snake hunting world.   Voight, sneeringthrough the entire movie, gives a pathetic and unbelievableperformance.       (As the characters die in the movie, see if you notice aninteresting relationship with the order of their death and the actor'sprobable salary.)       Finally, there are the real stars of the show -- the snakes.According to the press kit, there were two animatronic snakes whichwere augmented with computer imaging.   The largest snake was 40 feetlong and weighed over a ton.   The kit goes on to claim that snakeslike these do exist.       The special effects are the only reason to see the film.   Thefake snakes' movements are fascinating.   Director Luis Llosa usestypical horror film techniques to shock and gross out the audience.We get to hear people's bones snap, and we get an inside view from thesnake's stomach as someone is swallowed alive.   The snake even gets toregurgitate one of its human kills.   And you will lose count of howmany times snakes and humans come back from the dead to fight one moretime.       Perhaps because the filmmakers realized how hopeless ANACONDA was,they pumped up the music and the background sounds so much that youwill leave the theater looking for a little peace and quiet.   Onething that can be said for the film, it does have a high energy leveland lots of action, even if it is all preposterous.       ANACONDA runs a mercifully short 1:30.   It is rated PG-13 forgross and sometimes gory violence.   I'd be careful about letting kidsunder 13 go unless they are used to schlock horror films.   I give themovie thumbs down and * 1/2 for the special effects. ",Anaconda,PG-13,1997,1
49,"1997's ""Anaconda"" was a cheesy, slick B-movie that had fun with itspremise of a documentary film crew being terrorized by a very bigsnake, succeeding by never pretending to be anything more than a sillypopcorn entertainment. It also featured an impressive cast of risingA-listers„Jennifer Lopez, Owen Wilson, Ice Cube„and one deliciouslyover-the-top standout in human villain Jon Voight that raised it abovethe throwaway level. With no apparent connection to its predecessor,a cast made up mostly of talentless unknowns, and an out-of-placetone far too serious for its wholly ludicrous plot, ""Anacondas: TheHunt for the Blood Orchid"" is both excessively unnecessary and thoroughlyworthless. The original may not have been great, but it sometimestakes a truly awful motion picture to uncover another film's qualities. Hidden deep in the Borneo jungle is the Blood Orchid, an extremelyrare flower that blooms once every seven years and holds the key toeternal life. Seeing a chance to create a product that would be ""biggerthan Viagara,"" a group of entrepreneurs and scientists set out onthe jungle river to recover the flower. Before they can find it, however,their boat capsizes over a waterfall and they are left stranded inthe wilderness. The ragtag team soon realize they are not alone. Lurkingall around them are lethal, hungry Anaconda snakes, who guard theBlood Orchids and have been made giant by their extended lives. Suffering through the superfluously-titled ""Anacondas: The Hunt forthe Blood Orchid,"" it would be understandable to pose the followingquestion to oneself: ""Who wrote this asinine junk?"" While the presenceof a screenwriter is clear„no automated, unscripted movie, even alow-rent creature feature, could feature such an absurd premise„whatdoes boggle the mind is the participation of four writers (John Claflin,Daniel Zelman, Michael Miner, Edward Neumeier). Did they intentionallysit around day in and day out, concocting the most tediously drawn-outand creatively pedestrian of horror sequels, or is the lowly finishedproduct merely a freak accident on the part of hacks with grade-schoolabilities? Either way, ""Anacondas"" is a virtual rehash of ""Anaconda,""minus the former film's wickedly sly sensibilities, taut pacing, and passable suspense. For a film supposedly about robust killer snakes, ""Anacondas"" evenfails on fulfilling the expectations to see lots of slithering reptiles.With a mild, flavorless PG-13 rating that bars any of the deaths frombeing shown and the shots of the snakes nearly matching the amountalready seen in the theatrical trailer, the viewer is left malnourishedfrom what they came to see and never got. When the Anacondas are shown,they are bereft of the threatening personality they had in the original,waterlogged by the chintziest, most slapdash CG effects to grace astudio picture this year. Incredibly, filmmaker Dwight Little (a frequenttelevision director also responsible for 1988's respectable ""Halloween4: The Return of Michael Myers"") donates roughly 75 percent of hisinterminable 90-minute running time with hoary exposition and dialogue,treating his hopelessly wafer-thin characters as if they were beingplayed by performers who could actually act and carry scenes by themselves.They can't, and what is left is a pace equal to that of a dead snail. While not sharing identical names, all of the characters feel likereplacements for the 1997 actors. As scientist and head of the expedition,Gail Stern, Salli Richardson-Whitfield (2002's ""Antwone Fisher"") isthe poor man's Jennifer Lopez and, in certain scenes, a dead ringerfor the Latino star. As the stubborn but eventually moralistic GordonMitchell, Morris Chestnut (2004's ""Breakin' All the Rules"") has theIce Cube role. Richardson-Whitfield and Chestnut, the only veteransof the ensemble, are at least tolerable. Johnny Messner (2004's ""TheWhole Ten Yards""), as hunky, muscled tough guy Bill Johnson, is beyondamateurish in his sincere but unbelievable line deliveries. As virtuousSam Rogers, KaDee Strickland (2003's ""Something's Gotta Give"")„inthe Kari Wuhrer part„starts the film off with a laugh-inducingly thickSouthern accent and then promptly loses it altogether by the secondact. Like Strickland's promise as a thespian, her twang never returns.Almost as bad and easily more forgettable are Matthew Marsden (2001's""Black Hawk Down"")„no match for Jon Voight„as the slimy, money-hungryDr. Jack Byron, and Eugene Byrd (2002's ""8 Mile"")„an amalgamationof Ice Cube's and Owen Wilson's parts„as t oken black comic relief Cole Burris. Save for a couple unintentional guffaws near the beginning, ""Anacondas:The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" doesn't even fall into the ""so badit's entertaining"" category. It is a chore to sit through, as unscary,threadbare, and downright dull as these kinds of movies come. If itwere not for the box-office success of its precursor, there is nodoubt it would have gone direct-to-video next to similar giant-snakeschlock like 2002's ""Boa"" and 2000's ironically superior ""Python.""""Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid"" scrapes the bottom of thebarrel and then digs lower without even trying (director Dwight Littleplainly didn't), making one long for weeks' past when the mediocre""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" were released.When you go to see a film about huge, deadly snakes and the sickeninglyprecocious monkey who tags along on the humans' trip gets more screentime than the reptilian villains„and lives to see the end credits,no less„ you know you're in trouble. ",Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid,PG-13,2004,0.5
50,"1999's ""Analyze This"" was a stale, uneven mobster comedy with theunlikely partnering of Robert De Niro (2002's ""City by the Sea"") andBilly Crystal (2001's ""America's Sweethearts""). Neverminding its quality,the film somehow made over $100-million at the box office, and commonknowledge tells you that where there's money to be made in Hollywood,there's a sequel just around the corner. ""Analyze That"" is more ofthe same--a near-carbon copy of its predecessor--meaning that it hasa handful of funny moments surrounded by a boatload of unfunny ones. Approaching the end of his 18-month sentence in a Sing Sing prison,former mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) has apparently flown overthe edge into insanity, performing nonstop songs from ""West Side Story.""When former psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) is called uponto diagnose Vitti, Ben unwittingly is forced to take Vitti home withhim until his condition improves. Little does the prison board knowthat it is all just an act to get prematurely released. Sure enough,after failed attempts at real jobs to go straight, Vitti has resortedback into his Mafia family.  ""Analyze That"" is a tedious excursion into formulaic and uninspiredcomedic territory. Returning writer-director Harold Ramis and co-screenwritersPeter Steinfeld and Peter Tolan fail to put a fresh spin on the original'salready-tired material, with their idea of inventiveness being thespoofing of ""The Sopranos"" with a show called ""Little Caesar."" With nothing of note on display, and no new insights into the paper-thincharacters, the film is mired in desperation. The enjoyable outtakesshown over the end credits only further concrete this suspicion. The returning actors on display--De Niro, Crystal, Lisa Kudrow (2000's""Lucky Numbers""), and Joe Viterelli (2002's ""Serving Sara"")--deservemuch better than the lackluster material they have been given. Granted,having De Niro deliriously sing the soundtrack from ""West Side Story""may have appeared funny on paper, but it only comes off as odd inthe finished product. The few zingers that do work can only be attributedto the actors' delivery. As Crystal's exasperated wife, Laura, LisaKudrow is the movie's most regretful casualty, thoroughly wasted andput to no worthwhile use in the proceedings. ""Analyze That"" moves a more successful pace than ""Analyze This,"" butthat is its only claim to superiority. By the time the overlong heistclimax comes into play, even its halfhearted striving for comedy allbut disappears to make way for dull action scenes. If ""Analyze theOther Thing"" comes to fruition in 2005, the thought of being shotpoint-blank may sound like a more desirable option than having towallow through another 95 minutes of such inanity.",Analyze That,R,2002,2.5
51," When a New York Mob boss starts having panic attacks andsecretly seeks out a suburban psychiatrist what you get is one of themost inventive, original comedies in years.  Robert De Niro isterrific as the powerful, domineering gangster, Paul Vitti, whoseparalyzing anxiety is preventing him from assuming his role as leaderof his crime family. And Billy Crystal has never been better than asthe divorced psychotherapist, Dr. Sobel, with a young son and adetermined fiancee (""Friends"" Lisa Kudrow) he's about to marry. ""Whatis my goal?"" he asks. ""To make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster?""Despite Dr. Sobel's understandable terror of his new patient, he'sgamely determined to unravel the mystery of Vitti's childhood and makehim healthy enough to cope with an all-important Mafia meeting - injust two weeks. Cleverly directed as a fable with Damon Runyonovertones by Harold Ramis (""Groundhog Day"") from a wickedly amusingscreenplay by Peter Tolan, Howard Ramis and Kenneth Lonergan, thismovie offers a rollicking good time, balancing drama, suspense, andaction, as Vitti's psychological troubles have the audience literallyhowling with laughter. The key, of course, is that the problems (fear,grief, rage, and guilt) are firmly grounded in reality and De Niro'swillingness to poke fun at the screen persona that he has created overthe years, along with Crystal's amusing reactions to theconflicts. Their sense of timing is flawless, and the humor is deeplyinherent in each of their characters. Chazz Palminteri and JosephViterelli ring true in supporting roles. On the Granger Movie Gauge of1 to 10, ""Analyze This"" is a devilishly clever, utterly hilarious 10,the first genuine comedy hit of 1999. ",Analyze This,R,1999,3
52,"Entering the marketplace as the third broad comedy in less than amonth, ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" places smack dab inthe middle, behind the delightfully goofy ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog'sStory"" but ahead of the dumb, disposable ""White Chicks."" As a satireof news broadcasts, the film has its bitey moments of knowing lunacy,but ""Dodgeball"" was largely more creative and successful in its sportssatirizing. The latter's hit-to-miss laugh ratio was also notablyhigher. For all of the comedy that works spectacularly well in ""Anchorman,""there are three times as many jokes that either try too hard, or simplyfall to the ground with a resounding thud. Set in the 1970s„a time when the public trusted its newspeople andbelieved every word they said„Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), lead anchorat San Diego's KVWN Channel 4 Evening News, is at the top of the localratings. A womanizing male chauvinist in a profession filled withother male chauvinists, Ron Burgundy and his co-workers/co-horts,Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and BrickTamland (Steve Carell), feel threatened when the ever-ambitious VeronicaCorningstone (Christina Applegate) is hired to be the first-ever on-the-scenefemale news reporter. Ron is instantly smitten with Veronica, whoin return finds herself uncontrollably attracted to Ron, but theirblooming romance is put into jeopardy when Veronica is promoted tobe Ron's co-anchor. It isn't long before Ron realizes Veronica hastrue talent in the field, whereas he has been coasting along withlittle to offer but absent-minded charm. Directed by Adam McKay (making his feature debut after cutting histeeth on TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), ""Anchorman: The Legend of RonBurgundy"" is an ambitious comedy of hits and misses that has troublefinding its groove. The opening 15 minutes are almost completely lackingin laughs (there are jokes and puns, to be sure, but they are consistentlyunfunny), and it isn't until the one-hour mark that the film settlesinto a relatively comfortable pattern of solid material. Much of thehumor is intentionally cornball or of the slapstick variety„a fightto the death between the different station's feuding anchors, playedin cameos by Luke Wilson (2003's ""Alex and Emma""), Ben Stiller (2004's""Starsky & Hutch""), Tim Robbins (2003's ""Mystic River""), and in aslight ly larger role as smarmy Wes Mantooth, Vince Vaughn (2004's""Dodgeball: A True Underdog's Story""), is so off-the-wall as to almostseem like a fantasy sequence„and it is only on sporadic occasions that it takes off. When the film does hits the bull's-eye, however, the results are uproarious.The section in which Ron and Veronica go to any length possible tosabotage each other's job inspires a series of genuine guffaws, particularlyone scene in which Veronica is introduced on the air in an outrageouslyderogatory fashion. An on-going joke concerning Ron's confusion overthe saying, ""When in Rome,"" and a glimpse at what news anchors mightbe saying to each other at the end of the program when the sound goesdown and the credits roll, are also wittier and funnier than the movie'snorm. And the inspired casting of illustrious ""American Justice"" hostBill Kurtis as the narrator is downright genius, recalling the appearanceof ""Unsolved Mysteries"" host Robert Stack in 1998's ""BASEketball."" For some of its running time, ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy""is able to slide by solely on the big laughs that are garnered. Notso fortunately, the film is bogged down too often in a state of distinctlistlessness. While not pivotal to, say, a drama, a comedy's first,middle, and last acts should always be readily apparent to the audience.This is not the case with ""Anchorman,"" which hops from one set-pieceto the next without firmly establishing its central plot. Is the movieabout Ron Burgundy's journey to becoming a better anchor and a betterman? Is it about the cutthroat environment of television news stations,and Ron's attempts to thwart Veronica's rise to the top? Is it a romancebetween Ron and Veronica? Is it about Ron's fight to retain the topspot amongst the other channel's news programs? The film ends up beingall of the above, but not enough time is spent with any of these subplotsto make the impact they intend. One thing is for sure: Will Ferrell (2003's ""Elf"") is a real moviestar, a brilliantly timed comic actor who manages to make Ron Burgundy,a decided scumbag, irresistible. Ron may not have much talent, butFerrell's likable performance makes it easy to see why this bumblingnews anchor captures so many viewers' hearts. Christina Applegate(2002's ""The Sweetest Thing"") makes Veronica Corningstone a winningpresence and much more than a passive love interest, holding her ownagainst Ferrell in some of the picture's funniest moments. While gameenough players, Paul Rudd (2003's ""The Shape of Things""), Steve Carell(2003's ""Bruce Almighty""), and David Koechner (2003's ""My Boss's Daughter"")fail to make their slimy roles congenial in the same way Ferrell isable to do with Ron. As station boss Ed Harken, the underrated FredWillard (2003's ""American Wedding"") struggles with little to do. ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a marginal entertainmentwith some greatly funny scenes definitely worth seeing, but is therest of the movie worth wading through to get to them? Probably not.The screenplay, credited to Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay,is a scattershot affair that could have benefited from another rewriteor two, tightening and centering its murky premise. And whatever involvementthe viewer has with the characters is due to the fine actors playingthem; even Ron Burgundy could be considered a one-dimensional creation.""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" has some worthwhile, realisticstatements to make about the changing ways within the male-heavy 1970swork environment, but the film itself doesn't provide enough hard-hittingsatirical coverage to make the rest of it palatable. ",Anchorman,R,2004,2
53,"      The great director Robert Wise will probably be forever rememberedfor such popular musicals as WEST SIDE STORY and SOUND OF MUSIC eventhough he does have some significant science fiction films to hiscredit, including STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE and THE DAY THE EARTHSTOOD STILL.       In 1971 Wise directed the first film adaptation of a MichaelCrichton novel, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN.  The film's screenwriter, NelsonGidding, has had a particularly mediocre career, including suchunmemorable films as BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE MUMMY LIVES.Nevertheless, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN's staging and scripting give it aneerie documentary feel that works perfectly.       The setup for the movie is that a United States satellite crashesinto an isolated desert town.  On-board the satellite is a tiny organismfrom outer space that instantly kills everyone in town except an olddrunk and a crying baby.  The show's conundrum is what is the commonthread that saved these two disparate individuals.       Men in protective gear are sent to survey the scene and determinewhat has happened.  The only thing they are sure of is that the organismfrom space is responsible and that death occurs by turning theirvictim's blood into powder.       This first and most frightening part gives way to the second wheredeep underground in the world's cleanest environment, four scientistsrush to find the cause and the cure for the greatest disaster to haveever struck earth.       Arthur Hill in one of his finest performances ever plays the team'slead scientist, Dr. Jeremy Stone.  Dr. Stone wants all proceduresfollowed carefully and no short-cuts taken just because they are underpressure.  When the strain has them all about to crack, he relents andbecomes more willing to cut corners in their experiments.       David Wayne plays the team's wise old man, Dr. Charles Dutton.James Olson is the team's handsome, young Dr. Mark Hall.  Since Dr. Hallis the only single member of the crew, he gets to carry the key that candisarm the underground station's self-destruct system.  They discuss indetail the scientific experiments that proved that a single person willbe the most rational user of the key.  Presumably a married person mightstop the self-destruct for some selfish reason having to do with hisfamily.       As the odd woman out, Kate Reid plays the only female member of thegroup, Dr. Ruth Leavitt.  Carefully casting an exceedingly homely andpudgy woman, the focus stays firmly on her technical abilities andleaves aside the usual love interest that most scripts seem obliged toinclude.  Dr. Leavitt, as it turns out, has some yet-to-be-discoveredlimitations, but scientifically she is a valuable member of the team.       The beauty of the script and the direction is the contrast of thefast paced demands placed on the researchers with the meticulousness oftheir experiments.  They talk and argue like scientists whereasaudiences are used to expensive actors showing off their emotions atevery turn.  One might criticize Wise's presentation as dull, but to meit was brilliantly realistic and totally captivating.  Every twist andturn in the show draws you more and more into the story.  The ending isarguably a bit too neat, but works nevertheless.       THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN runs 2:11.  It is rated PG for mature themesand would be fine for kids around nine and up. ","Andromeda Strain, The",G,1971,3.5
54,"In ANGEL EYES, Sharon Pogue is a tough-as-nails Chicago police officer.She's the type who hangs out at the bar after work, belting beers with theboys from the precinct.  Although she can trade insults with the best ofthem, she's really a sad loner who is never more uncomfortable than when sheattempts dating.   Combining a bit of her charm from THE WEDDING PLANNER and her intrigue fromTHE CELL, Jennifer Lopez, as Officer Pogue, is one of the two reasons to seeANGEL EYES.  The other is her costar, James Caviezel (FREQUENCY and PAY ITFORWARD), who plays an illusive character known as Catch -- no last name.Catch is a Good Samaritan who turns off people's car lights and knocks onneighbors' doors when they leave the keys in them.  More comfortable in theshadows than in the light, he is a nervous type who wanders aimlesslythrough dangerous streets at night.  (His happiness can be seen in strangeways.  The happier he is, the more often he shaves.) The biggest argument against seeing ANGEL EYES comes from its MESSAGE IN ABOTTLE team of director Luis Mandoki and writer Gerald Di Pego.  An unevenstory that moves in fits and spurts, it has trouble ever quite deciding whatit wants to be.  Not a romance, per se, although there is an obligatory sexscene, which is both brief and bland, the film is more of an exploration oftwo characters' lives. Catch, for example, may or may not be alive.  Is he a ghost, an angel, atrauma victim or what?  Sharon, who grew up in an abusive family, appears tobe hiding some secrets of her own.  Catch and Sharon, who share an easilyguessed bond, form a mutual help group.  Their relationship is awkward sincethey both suffer from various forms of denial. One thing is certain, the movie is in no rush to get wherever it is going.One character, a mysterious shut-in, Elanora (Shirley Knight), asks, ""Whydoes everybody have to rush everything these days?""  The line feels ratherlike a lecture to the audience to stop being impatient. At its best, the movie can drive home some excellent points with the best ofthese showing how a single moment in one's life can be so incrediblyprecious or tragic.  But the proof of the story's effectiveness comes in theend.  Catch and Sharon each have what are obviously designed to bethree-hankie scenes, but both leave you completely dry-eyed.  One thing iscertain, you can't fault the acting since it is splendid throughout. ANGEL EYES runs a long 1:44.  It is rated R for language, violence and ascene of sexuality and would be acceptable for teenagers.",Angel Eyes,R,2001,3
55,"      I think ANGELS AND INSECTS is supposed to be a morality tale, butit is so outlandish, it is comes off more as parody.  If it were not soslow and somber, one might be tempted to laugh at it.       ANGELS AND INSECTS tells about the lives of naturalists and is setin England in 1864.  The movie's purpose is to show the strong linkagebetween humans and insects.  In one of the more pedantic editing jobs(Belinda Haas) in recent memory, we have frequent cuts between thehorrors of the insect world and that of the human.  Although there areseveral memorable insects scenes, perhaps the most dramatic is theimmolation scene of the moths in the ubiquitous candles that lit therooms of that era.  A close second is a scene straight out of THE BIRDSbut with moths instead of birds attaching the helpless female.       As the movie starts, the camera (Bernard Zitzermann) is drawn intoswirl of unfocused images which on closer inspection turn out to be""savages"" dancing.  As soon as the viewer realizes that the film ismeant to be out of focus and that he does not need to run and complainto the manager, the film switches to a swirl of upper-class dancers inEngland and here the colors are rich and the picture is sharp.  Watchthe costumes (Paul Brown) in this and every scene of the show for theyare as ridiculous and pedantic as the editing.  Some gowns areovergrown with fruit favored by insects while others are made to looklike insects, e.g., bold and broad, yellow and black bee stripes.       It seems that Mr. William Adamson (Mark Rylance) has just returnedfrom the Amazon without his specimens, having lost them all in ashipwreck.  This means he has no way of earning a living.  Thispredicament is quickly solved when Sir Harold Alabaster (Jeremy Kemp)and Lady Alabaster (Annette Badland) invite him to stay in their homesince they all share an interest in entomology.  Well it turns out thatthe Alabaster's home is a highly dysfunctional one, and we have longsince learned from the movies that almost all Victorian homes were.Since I am sure movies would not lie to us, it is nice to be safelyensconced in the late twentieth century.       Mr. Adamson soon falls under the spell of the lovely EugeniaAlabaster (Patsy Kensit).  She has a slight problem in that herprevious fiance killed himself rather than marry her for mysteriousreasons which left her a bit mixed up.  Nevertheless, Mr. Adamson soonmarries her.  Eugenia has a brother Edger (Douglas Henshall) who is thecanonical rich wastrel.  He does not approve of Mr. Adamson and tellshim, ""you are underbreed and not a good match for my sister.""        The servants all turn their heads and face the wall whenever Mr.Adamson goes by, and he does not know what to make of this.  AsEugenia's relative Matty Crompton (Kristin Scott Thomas) says, ""Thereare people in houses who can know a great deal if they choose.""  Iguess the servants are not supposed to know the dark secrets of theAlabaster household.  The shocking ending of this movie is telegraphedabout a million times, but I will not reveal it here, although thetrailers for the movie do.  In one of the better pieces of dialog, thehusband says of the mystery, ""Whom can I tell that I should not destroyin the telling.""       This is a show where I developed an admiration for all of the finedetails of my watch.  At the one hour point, I began to wonder what, ifanything, was ever going to happen.  As it turns out, in the lastquarter of the film the actors and actress come alive as if they hadcome through a metamorphosis.  Why director Philip Haas did not breathlive into the show before then astonishes me.  There is a genuine,albeit mainly unrealized, potential in this picture.       Actually, the worst part of the movie is not the ploddingdirection, it is the stilted script by Belinda and Philip Haas.  Mostof the lines fall like stones and are laden with gibberish.  A typicalone forces the excellent actress Kristin Scott Thomas to have to sayverbatim, ""I wish humankind would create such altruistic virtues, butsometimes I think socialism may never be realized.""       ANGELS AND INSECTS runs too long at 1:57.  It is rated R for lotsof sex including certain perversions and full male and female frontalnudity, but if you are looking for an erotic show, I think you have thewrong film.  I would not let teenagers see the show unless they weremature.  Although I am glad the characters finally came alive towardthe end, I can not recommend ANGELS AND INSECTS to anyone, and I giveit a single * for a good conclusion to a poor film. ",Angels and Insects,R,1996,2
56,"Notwithstanding Paul Thomas Anderson's challenging 2002 film, ""Punch-DrunkLove,"" Adam Sandler has been known to play one of two different typesof characters, each surrounded by the same basic plot conventionsand a tried-and-true love interest. Sandler's normal, sweet-guy roleshave unquestionably been more successful, such as his best picture, 1998's ""The Wedding Singer"" (opposite Drew Barrymore), 1999's ""BigDaddy"" (Joey Lauren Adams), and 2002's ""Mr. Deeds"" (Winona Ryder),while his more goofy, mean-spirited parts have fallen flat, as in1995's ""Billy Madison"" (Bridgette Wilson), 1998's ""The Waterboy"" (FairuzaBalk), and 2000's ""Little Nicky"" (Patricia Arquette). Despite fallinginto the former, statistically more promising category, ""Anger Management""goes against the odds to place as one of Sandler's weaker, more slapdash efforts. This time, Sandler is paired with not only Marisa Tomei (2001's ""Inthe Bedroom""), but Jack Nicholson (2002's ""About Schmidt""), an actinglegend who automatically gives the film a level of prestige it doesn'tdeserve. Despite the talent involved, director Peter Segal (2000's""Nutty Professor II: The Klumps"") and screenwriter David Dorfman letall the respective parties down, offering no one the kind of high-levelcomedic material they deserve. There is the occasional laugh in ""AngerManagement,"" to be sure, but it is an undoubted certainty that eachand every funny moment can be accounted to the performers' skills,rather than to standout or original writing. David Buznik (Adam Sandler), a soft-spoken and mild-mannered ad executivefor animal products with a sweet girlfriend named Linda (Marisa Tomei),is the epitome of bland kindness. When a misunderstood argument occurson a plane trip, David suddenly finds himself sentenced to anger managementsessions, taught by the wildly unorthodox Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson).And when a second misconstrued run-in with the law leaves David facingjail time, he instead agrees to allow Buddy to move in with him, actingas his psychiatrist for the next thirty days. As Buddy sets out to""cure"" David, David suddenly finds his world turned upside down bythe doctor's irrational and outrageous methods. With the unlikely pairing of Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson, ""AngerManagement"" had what it took to create genuine comic hilarity outof their differing personalities, but chooses not to take advantageof it. As the put-upon David, Adam Sandler plays--well--one of hismost restrained characters to date, but there is not a hint of complexityin him. As for Dr. Buddy Rydell, who in one of the film's brighterscenes forces himself into David's bed only to forwardly confess thathe likes ""to sleep in the nude,"" Jack Nicholson slums through theproceedings, given little more to do than exaggerate his famous eyebrow-raising mannerism. In the inevitable romantic subplot, Marisa Tomei--who, when giventhe chance, can give extraordinarily nuanced performances--is themovie's biggest missed opportunity. Tomei, who won an Academy Awardfor her unforgettably hilarious turn in 1992's ""My Cousin Vinny,""has such sharp comic timing that it is nearly a criminal act for thismovie to waste her abilities. As Linda, Tomei pops up every now andagain to stand around and look patient. No attempt is made to turnher into an actual character; the viewer is never even clued intowhat she does for a living. The less said about the chemistry betweenshe and Sandler, the better. That leaves a handful of the supporting characters to attempt to salvagethe day. Luis Guzman (2000's ""Traffic""), as the hostile, effeminateLou, and John Turturro (2002's ""Collateral Damage""), as fellow angermanagement assignee Chuck, brighten up every scene they are in. Insmaller roles still, Heather Graham (2001's ""Sidewalks of New York""),as a sultry, unstable bargoer, and Woody Harrelson (1999's ""EdTV""),as a transvestite, are surprisingly funny. Even former Mayor of NewYork Rudy Guiliani shows up in the climax, but his cameo is groan-inducing in the extreme. It is a shame director Peter Segal has chosen to botch the finishedproduct of ""Anger Management."" Even when there are laughs to be found,the movie is strictly a perfunctory affair, bawdy on the outside andhollow on the inside. By playing things safe around every corner,it is stripped of a solid reason for being.

57,"One of the things that differentiates the author of thisreview from most of the world's film critics is the opinionof John Landis. Many of Landis' films, often lauded bycritics, were disappointments for me. That is especially thecase in the latter part of his career, and it is hard toimagine why and how this author reached a cult status. But,earlier, while he was starting his cinema career in 1970s,he used to make quite nice films. One of the most legendaryones is ANIMAL HOUSE, 1978 comedy that was overshadowed byhis greatest success - BLUES BROTHERS, shot two years later.  This film actually doesn't have a lot of plot. It is set infictional Faber college in 1962 and chronicles the strugglebetween two student fraternities - Omegas, nice,by-the-book, rich, arrogant and powerful students, andDeltas, nonconformist losers who, instead of studying, spendall their time for alcohol, drugs, sex and different kindsof orgies. Their activity become the thorn in the side ofthe college administration who decide to kick them all out.But the brave Deltas would refuse to give up without afight, that would culminate in the apocalyptic parade in theend.  Some may think that ANIMAL HOUSE represents sorts ofautobiography for its writer Chris Miller, who based theplot on his own experiences as Darthmouth College student in1962. Others may argue that Landis in this film, byportraying the rivalry between Omegas and Deltas, gives hisown commentary about the great struggle between the forcesof Old and New in 1960s America. But the real motive forANIMAL HOUSE was most likely nothing more but the excuse forentire series of jokes, many of them so tasteless that theyreally questioned the standards of its, rather liberal,times. Yes, some of these jokes are rather tasteless, manyof them including Bluto (brilliantly played by late JohnBelushi) and his repetitive use of bodily fluids becomesboring after a while. Some other jokes also aren't so funny.But guess what? Film as a whole works as an excellent guiltypleasure - made without any redeeming values nor highartistic standards, but film that makes other, more nobleand ambitious works, to pale in comparison simply byentertaining viewers. Most of the jokes are funny,characters are well- played by excellent actors (DonaldSutherland, John Vernon, young Kevin Bacon among others),and the soundtrack is very good. The only real reason tobash ANIMAL HOUSE is the fact that it spawned entiresub-genre of its imitations in the decade to come - movieswith the words ""soft"", ""hard"" and ""body"" in title, all ofthem sharing its low standards, but not the talent of itscreators. But we shouldn't be too harsh towards ANIMAL HOUSE- today, same as two decades ago, it serves its purpose byentertaining us. ",Animal House,R,1978,3

In contrast, Luke Greenfield's ""The Animal"" is just plain lame. While the overall premise has definite comic possibilities, everything about the finished product screams, ""tiresome!""  The aptly-named Marvin Mange (Rob Schneider) is a crime evidence protector who dreams of becoming a police officer, if only he could pass the obstacle course section of the test. Following a freak car accident that leaves his body mangled, he is saved by mad scientist Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) by being replaced with spare internal animal parts. Returning to his daily life without any memories of what has happened to him, his newfound keen sense of smell helps him to peg a man at the airport carrying a bag full of heroin. Marvin soon finds himself becoming a cop, but his extreme animal urges are beginning to get the best of him.  No matter how hard screenwriters Tom Brady and Rob Schneider try to extract constant gags out of ""The Animal,"" it just isn't very funny. Excessively juvenile and with only one witty ongoing joke, involving ""reverse racism,"" a theory which Marvin's black friend, Miles (Guy Torry), creates, the film is a by-the-numbers effort from start to finish. At only 83 minutes, at least it is short.  Rob Schneider remains a likable personality, sort of a kinder, gentler Adam Sandler. He's a capable actor, and as ""Deuce Bigalow"" proved, can be quite funny when the material is strong. As his inevitable love interest, ""Survivor"" contestant Colleen Haskell plays Rianna, a feisty animal-lover who finds Marvin's similarities with her beloved animals endearing. It's difficult to say whether Haskell is a good actor; her thin role only requires that she smile a whole lot, and she does that well.  There isn't much else to say about ""The Animal."" I sat there for the duration of its running time unimpressed and without much to find amusing. Hopefully, Schneider will try a little harder his next time at bat, because with another movie as bad as ""The Animal,"" he may be in danger of turning into Pauly Shore. And we all know what he's doing now. Or, on second thought, we don't. ","Animal, The",PG-13,2001,1.5
59," If you've been heard to mutter, ""They don't make movies likethey used to..."" then this sentimental, spectacularly beautifulhistorical epic is for you. In this fourth film version of MargaretLandon's fanciful story of Anna Leonowens, the strong-willed, recentlywidowed schoolteacher who travels to Siam in 1862 with her young son(Tom Felton) to educate the King's 58 children in Western customs,Jodie Foster delivers a magnificent performance, combiningintelligence with compassion, dignity with vulnerability. Equallyimpressive is Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat as imposing KingMongkut, the proud monarch who is amazed when a stubborn, impertinent,English schoolmarm has the temerity to consider herself hisequal. Anna has Victorian preconceptions of primitive Siam while theKing, in turn, has his own disdainful preconceptions of Westerncivilization. Meanwhile, the ominous threat of an invasion byneighboring Burma, perhaps aided by the British, hangs over theirobviously growing affection for one another in this exotic,extravagant, romantic pastiche. Director Andy Tennant (Ever After) andcinematographer Caleb Deschanel (The Black Stallion), shooting inMalaysia, emphasize the lavish, breathtaking opulence and statelysplendor, conceived by production designer Luciana Arrighi, perhaps tothe extreme. That may be the result of the plodding, bland script bySteve Meerson and Peter Krikes which dulls the sharpness of theunderlying culture clash of racial, political and sexual tensions,relying instead on a weak, simplistic subplot involvingtreason. Nevertheless, on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Anna andthe King is a sumptuous 9, proving that the traditional Hollywoodformulas can still concoct gratifying entertainment. ",Anna and the King,PG-13,1999,3
60,"ANTITRUST, a thinly veiled cinematic diatribe against Bill Gates andMicrosoft, is a thriller about truth, justice and the open source codemovement.  Tim Robbins (ARLINGTON ROAD) stars as Gary Winston, the head andfounder of a monopolistic software conglomerate known as Synapse which likeMicrosoft is based in the Pacific Northwest.  Gary is made to look and dressalmost exactly like Gates.  He lives in a home like Gates's island house,right down to the electronic paintings on the walls.  Synapse even has thegovernment on his back like Microsoft does.  ""The Justice Department isdriving me nuts!"" Gary complains.  But wait, Synapse has more than killerapps.  They've got killer thugs on the payroll. In a pseudo-wink to the audience, Gary says that he's not like Bill Gates.With this line the studio can argue, perhaps not with a straight face, thatGary Winston really isn't meant to be Bill Gates after all. Putting aside the Bill Gates connection, the movie is pretty much a standardthriller in which no one is quite who they seem to be.  Sinister actionsabound, even at Synapse's on-site day care center.  Robbins approaches hisrole like that of a cad in a vaudeville melodrama.  You half expect him tograb a cloak, cover his nose with his elbow and sneer into the camera with a""Ya, ha, ha."" Still, as an over-the-top thriller, it is far from the worst.  The film,directed by Peter Howitt and written by Howard Franklin, works hard to getthe details of the technology and the slang right.  Even if what they claimto be able to accomplish with their gadgets may have more technologicallysophisticated viewers guffawing, the script is at least fairly consistent.Basically, Synapse is an Evil Empire with incredible snooping powers that itwould leave the CIA and the KGB in awe. Gary, who munches Pringles non-stop and guzzles Pepsi, -- don't you lovethose product placements? -- personally recruits Milo Hoffmann (RyanPhillippe).  Milo, is a new Computer Science graduate from Stanford.  Hisgraduate buddies want him to take the money from the venture capitalists andwork with them in their Palo Alto garage.  How do you spell clich_?  Well,Gary has been watching Milo -- and I do mean ""watching"" -- and wants him tocome to work instead on Synapse's hottest product.  It's a bet-the-companyproject that must ship in less than two months.  Quickly, it's goodbyefellow nerds for Milo.  He's gone to join the enemy.  You see, we arelectured about how nefarious Synapse is because it will not give away itssource code.  (Did I mention yet that Microsoft archrival Scott McNealy fromSun Microsystems gets to do a cameo?) ""The software business is binary,"" Gary, acting like some kind of cultleader, lectures Milo.  ""It's either one or zero.  You're either alive, oryou're dead.""  Gary, who speaks in something approximating marketingslogans, likes to scream things like, ""No limits!"" With all pervasive villainy, Gary and his minions surreptitiously drain thecollective programming knowledge of the world and pump it into theirheadquarters.  Milo is ready to fight back, if he can just figure out whomto trust.  Want to bet on who will win?  Oh well, given the other filmsopening Friday, ANTITRUST can lay claim to the title of only the third worstfilm of the week. ANTITRUST runs 1:43.  The film is sometimes in technogeek, but there are noEnglish subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for some violence and brief languageand would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.  ",Antitrust,PG-13,2001,1.5
61,"Before the ethereal melodies of  folk were crushed by thepounding rhythms of acid rock and punk, Harry Burleigh Thacker'sspiritual was popular during the 1960's..  It went like this:""Sometimes I feel like a motherless child/Sometimes I feel like amotherless child/Sometimes I feel like a motherless child/A longway from home...Motherless children have a real hard time/motherless children have a real hard time/motherless childrenhave such a real hard time/so long so long so long.""  If anythingcan make a human being or any other member of the animalkingdom feel lost, it's being without a mother.  DenzelWashington's first directorial effort, ""Antwone Fisher,"" has ascreenplay by the title character and is based on a real story of aNavy man who felt lost because he never knew his real mom, hada Dickensian background with a vicious foster parent andexploitative foster sister, and while he was so alienated that hecarried a chip on his shoulder that could be dislodged by the mostharmless comment, he thought that nothing was psychologicallywrong.     Fisher got into so many fights that you'd probably figure thatthis is a fellow you're not going to like.  Yet as played in aheartfelt, even charismatic manner by Derek Luke in a debutperformance, Fisher becomes a guy you'd want to stand up inyour theater seat to root for.  His vulnerability, his secret desire tobe loved while shucking off attempts at friendliness, afford the mana deserved sympathy from us in the audience, and though playedconventionally like a TV movie-of-the-week, ""Antwone Fisher"" iselevated by two dandy performances from director DenzelWashington as psychiatrist Jerone Davenport attached with hiswife to a West Coast Naval base and the aforementioned DerekLuke,  When the two get together, Fisher figuratively on the couchwith a now no-nonsense, now down-home commander giving himextra attention for reasons known to the doctor but not until theconclusion by the audience, you're sure that your own analysiscould have been more successful if only you had such anunderstanding and empathetic fellow as your shrink.     Though the real Antwone Fisher became a security guard atSony Pictures Studios after his stint in the Navy and had littlewriting experience, he was hired by producer Todd Black to scripthis own life: that's how compelling his story must have seemed tohim.  Is the story really that gripping?  Not really, when youconsider that in an age that more families are played on the bigscreen as studies in dysfunction, his background is unfortunatelynot too uncommon.       As shown with a few flashbacks, using young Malcolm DavidKelley to portray the seven-year-old Antwone and Cory Hodges inthe same role seven years later, Fisher recalls that his father wasmurdered by a girlfriend two months before Antwone was born andthat he had come into the world at the Ohio State CorrectionalFacility courtesy of his incarcerated mother, Eva (Viola Davis),who promptly gave him up to an orphanage.  Raised with a coupleof other lads and an older foster sister by the abusive Mrs. Tate(Novella Nelson) who would from time to time tie the boy up andbeat him with a wet towel while at other times his foster sistergave him a dislike for women by introducing the seven-year-old tosexual games Antwone nonetheless grew up to be a decentperson except for one flaw.  He'd fight as soon as he'd chat withhis buddies on board ship. When one such altercation led him toa compulsory visit to psychiatrist Dr. Davenport (DenzelWashington), he at first refused to cooperate but later opened up. Thanks to the forwardness of pretty Cheryl Smolley (Joy Bryant)who worked at the base, he has a chance to overcome hishostility to the opposite sex and spends the rest of the storyeither chatting with the good doctor or engaging with his girlfriendon a search after a quarter of a century for his real mom.     How an encounter with his mother would help him ""moveforward,"" or how a handful of visits to a psychiatrist could makethis fellow whole is anyone's guess.  Once we accept Mr. Fisherat his word, though, we watch most impressive performances fromthe ensemble, particularly the give and take between Mr.Washington and Mr. Luke, as they run through instantpsychoanalysis and in a surprise ending discover a counter-transference: the doctor and his wife (Salli Richardson) are helpedmore by their relationship with Fisher than is he by Davenport.  ",Antwone Fisher,PG-13,2003,3
62,"When authors like Jean-Paul Sartre and Fyodor Dostoevskyfind their names dropped into a contemporary film, you knowthat you're dealing either with Ingmar Bergman or Woody Allen. Both confront a cold, dark universe where life has no meaning,where people enter into relationships to deflect their thoughtsfrom death or, in the short run, out of fear of sleeping alone. Given the way that the bonds between couples tend with time tofade or wither away, some may wonder why we make the effortto nurture them, particularly when David Dobel (Woody Allen),speaking to the young man he mentors, Jerry Falk (JasonBiggs), declares, ""If you dry a styptic pencil carefully after eachshave, it will last longer than any of your relationships.""     Bon mots like that are few and far between in the forty-sixthfilm that Mr. Allen has had input, whether as director, writer,actor or voice-over.  With dialogue that seems at timesimprovised as speakers are regularly interrupted in mid-sentence as are people in real life, ""Anything Else"" is on the onehand more or less like anything else that Woody Allen hasdirected.  On the other hand, there is originality as thecelebrated writer-director engages the talent of JasonBiggs whose Al-Gore stiffness has been utilized well in both theBroadway production of ""The Graduate"" and in the currentmovie and Christina Ricci, considered by some to be hot(particularly in this work) but in my view is (as Woody might sayin referring to various aspects of life),  ""Eh.""     There's nothing political this time around, nothing that has thegravitas of ""Zelig"" or the bleakness of ""Interiors,"" while at thesame time ""Anything Else"" is no ""Annie Hall"" or ""Manhattan."" However just as Woody Allen used the miscast KennethBranagh as his alter ego in the embarrassing ""Celebrity,"" herehe utilizes Jason Biggs to depict Allen himself when the directorwas in his 20s and  writing comedy for Sid Caesar.  ""AnythingElse,"" then is partly autobiographical, though somecircumstances are fictionalized such as the conclusion in whichthe Biggs character is on his way to L.A. because that's wherethe big bucks are for comedy writers.     Biggs (that is, the 67-year-old Allen at the age of 25 or so)performs in the role of Jerry Falk, an upcoming writer whodashes off scripts for the equally youthful men and women whouse Comedy Corner and other New York locales to get theirstart in the biz.  When Falk meets Amanda (Christina Ricci)during a double-date at an Indian restaurant, he is smitten withher as is she with him.  Little does Falk know at the time thatAmanda is childish a coquette who enjoys being chased butwho cools down considerably when living with a guy for a shorttime.  Jerry has an agent, Harvey (Danny DeVito), with whom hehas an expiring 3-year contract and who gets the whopping sumof 25% cluing the audience that Jerry is an easy sell, adoormat, settling into destructive arrangements with both menand women because of a fear of sleeping alone and anunwillingness to walk away from a bad situation one that getsprogressively worse when Amanda's fast-talking mother Paula(Stockard Channing) moves into his small apartment at herdaughter's invitation.  He cannot get his  psychiatrist (WilliamHill) to say more than four words at a time ""What do YOU think,""and listens more readily to his mentor David Dobel (WoodyAllen), whom he meets regularly in Central Park to hear theolder man's paranoid fantasies.     Given Biggs's stiffness and Ricci's flat role as a neuroticwoman playing musical beds, the film comes most to lifewhenever Woody Allen holds court, whether his character issmashing the windows of a car that stole his parking space(which the timid Jerry could never imagine doing) or schleppingJerry to New Jersey to set him up with a rifle for protection.        The Manhattan that forms the background for perhaps most ofAllen's films is lush, with Darius Khondji's photography evokinga tourist's dream of Central Park, attractions like the QuadCinema, and the brownstones in the Village.  Jason Biggs haseffectively cut loose from adolescent (although in some casesfunnier) works such as ""American Pie,"" and though ChristinaRicci is no Diane Keaton,  ""Anything Else"" is worth a trip even ifit's not Allen at his best. ",Anything Else,R,2003,2.5
63,"    As I was leaving the theater playing ""Anywhere But Here,"" Irealized that the movie had contributed a personal insight. This wasn't an intuition that came on me like an epiphany butmore like one that strengthened a belief I had always had butabout which I needed more convincing.  When I was thirteenyears old, about to graduate from junior high school, Ireceived an acceptance letter from Stuyvesant High School inManhattan.  To this day Stuyvesant is a special place, acompetitive school for kids who pass a rigorous entranceexam.  I happened to be the only one in my JHS to be solucky, so you can imagine my disappointment when my momannounced that I was instead to go to a different place--aprep school which she had chosen for me and for which sheand my dad would have to work even harder to afford.  Ididn't particularly rebel against this decision of theirs butrather felt unable to resist her determination to send methere.  Years, even decades later, I wondered about her realmotivation.     Now with ""Anywhere But Here"" comes a story that clarifiesher resolve.  Like the character of Adele August, she wantedwhat was best for me, what might open more doors in myfuture.  If this sounds in hindsight like a simple enough pieceof wisdom--the ""duh"" factor--strangely enough this hadscarcely entered my mind at the time.       If a book, play, or movie can clarify some important facet ofour own lives, then that's a big plus for the art form; is it not? ""Anywhere But Here"" may be conventional as coming-of-agedramas go, but with photographer Roger Deakins's sharp,wide-lens photography throughout forty locations in LosAngeles, Alvin Sargent's solid screenplay from MonaSimpson's novel (and one which avoids excessivesentimentality), and most of all some absolutely wonderfulperformances by Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as amother and daughter team in conflict, the film is a remarkableachievement.  Its skillful direction by Wayne Wang, whose""Joy Luck Club"" gives him all the credentials he needs forhelming such a drama, is not the least of the reasons for itssuccessful, down-to-earth portrayal of family rivalry andreconciliation.     The most arresting twist of this comedy-drama is a reversalof the roles we usually expect from parents and their children. Adele August (Susan Sarandon) is the mother of a 14-year-old girl, Ann (Natalie Portman), but as you watch them drivingacross half the country from Bay City, Wisconsin to BeverlyHills, California, you'd not know from their actions which wasthe adult and which the child.  Adele, a bouncy, Auntie Mametype, turns up the radio to a Beach Boys' rendition of ""Surfin'Safari,"" bopping along to the music, singing the lyrics lustily,while her teen daughter mopes on the passenger sidecomplaining ""I hate the Beach Boys.""  Ann is furious anddepressed that she is being ""kidnapped"" by her mom, takenaway from the small town she loves which includes all herfriends and especially the cousin she dearly loves, Benny(Shawn Hatosy).  In Ann's mind, her mother is selfish, simplywanting to get away from her second husband, a nice guy butone whom Adele considers boring.  Not for Adele is a lifelongpartnership with a guy who will always be an ice skatinginstructor and a claustrophobic town full of people who lookforward to a life's career as supermarket checkers.  Instead,Adele wants her daughter to take up a career in acting, onein which the young woman has no interest.  How's that forrole reversal?     Director Wang exploits the talents of these two first-rateperformers wonderfully, displaying for us a collage ofepisodes that, taken together, elegantly defines the characterof these people.  Adele's vulnerability, hiding only slightlybeneath her bluster, emerges when she confuses a one-nightstand with a dashing orthodontist with true romance.  But in agreat many situations she is on the money.  In one scene,she is dropping her understandably anxious daughter off ather new school in Beverly Hills.  ""They look like they're goingto the beach,"" Ann protests upon seeing kids that could havecome out of Amy Heckerling's ""Clueless."" ""The intelligentones are inside,"" comforts her mom.     Wayne Wang may want us at first to share Ann's belief thather mom is looking out only for herself each time he showsAdele grasping for material goods.  In one comic display, thetwo are about to check into the Beverly Hills Hotel. Discovering that the room would be $1200 a night, Adelecomplains that the lodging is too small and asks for a villa,breathing more easily when she is told that there are noneleft that week.  Adele's embarrassment at her lack of fundscomes to a head when the electricity in their ordinary flat inthe unfashionable part of Beverly Hills is shut off.       Throughout the film, however, we see that mother anddaughter need each other despite their arguments: that momis terrified about losing her, and Ann, for all her whining, bothneeds and has a great affection for Adele.  As the pictureapproaches its conclusion, we're all aware that this portrayalof the most basic relationship we have will come to anoptimistic conclusion.  But as we ride along with the duo's1978 Mercedes from occasion to episode, we realize that thismovie, while perhaps more appealing to women in theaudience (whose male friends would rather see Ms. Portmanin ""The Phantom Menace""), is not a chick flick.  We've all hadmothers and none of us can honestly claim an unabashedlyjoyous connection with them.  Fortunate is each of us indeedwhen we discover, as does the beautiful and talented Ann,that ""when she dies, the world will be flat...too reasonable.""",Anywhere But Here,PG-13,1999,2.5
64,"Twenty-two years after Francis Ford Coppola finished his masterpiece,APOCALYPSE NOW, he has recut the film, adding in almost an extra hour offootage into a new version titled APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX.  Although it runsover three-and-a-quarter hours, it feels shorter than your average hour anda half movie.  It is so mesmerizing that I kept forgetting to shift in myseat, causing posterior to start to hurt.  APOCALYPSE NOW is the big movie that Francis Ford Coppola originally wantedto make, but he had to make THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER: PART 2 first inorder to get the studio backing and the money.  The filming was a disasterin about every way imaginable, including being struck by a typhoon.  Theresult was that it took him 16 months rather than the scheduled 6 weeks tocomplete the filming.  By the end, Coppola was broke and had lost 100pounds, but he finally had his magnum opus finished. As the story opens, we meet Captain Benjamin L. Willard, a man way past hisbreaking point.  Willard is played brilliantly by Martin Sheen, who had aheart attack during the filming.  The genius of the film comes almost asmuch from Sheen as Coppola.  In particular, Sheen's intimate, diary-likenarration is the best part of the movie.  The film's script is by JohnMilius and Francis Ford Coppola, inspired by Joseph Conrad's novel Heart ofDarkness.  (The film's title appears only in graffiti, very late in thefilm.  There are absolutely no opening credits.)  ""For my sins, they gave me a mission,"" Willard tells us sadly andfatalistically in voice-over as, drunk and bloody, he crashes around hisSaigon hotel room.  A former CIA operative, Willard is tired, very tired andhopeless. A very young and awkward Harrison Ford, as Colonel G Lucas, gives Willardhis assignment.  Lucas orders Willard to terminate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz(Marlon Brando).  ""Terminate with extreme prejudice,"" a man identified onlyas a civilian (Jerry Ziesmer) clarifies the orders.  After this, Lucas adds,""You understand, Captain, that this mission does not exist nor will it everexist.""   Willard boards a small boat to go way up river into Cambodia in order tolocate Kurtz.  Willard exists in a world of his own.  He doesn't belong inVietnam, but, after having recently gone home, he realizes that he doesn'tbelong there anymore either.  He feels quite different from the youngsoldiers on the small boat with him.  They smoke dope and drop acid as theyhead through deadly territory.  A 14-year-old ""Larry"" Fishburne (THE MATRIX)plays one of these solders. Willard wonders why they want Kurtz killed.  Is it just politics?  The morehe reads about Kurtz from his dossier, the more he comes to admire him.Dennis Hopper, as a spaced-out, freelance photographer, calls Kurtz, ""a poetwarrior in the classic sense."" Along the way, Willard meets Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (RobertDuvall), an officer nicknamed ""Big Duke.""  With his large hat, golden ascotand the looks of a GQ model, Kilgore is a fearless soldier who thinks nobullet can touch him and who prides himself on taking care of his men.  He'salso a huge surfing fan.  When he finds the perfect wave, at least asperfect as can be found in Vietnam, he orders his surfers to suit up.  Butsince this is in the middle of a battle, the napalm, much to Kilgore'schagrin, spoils the wind and hence the surf.   One of the film's most impressive visuals is of Kilgore's air cavalryhelicopters coming in to bomb and strafe a village.  As they swoop down fromthe skies, Kilgore orders ""The Ride Of The Valkyries"" to be played loudly onthe helicopter's loudspeakers in order to scare the villagers. With sweeping vistas, incredible sound effects and dramatic music and withsoldiers seen frequently in mud, blood, sweat and war paint, Coppola paintsa surrealistic view of the war from realistic parts.  This is in contrast toanother brilliant war movie, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which Spielberg madeequally horrifying using photorealism.   One of the many added scenes in APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX is one with Playboybunnies in which the young soldiers try to pose them in the same position asthey were in their centerfold pictures.  It comes off sadly touching. This hell on earth is best described by one of the men deep in the junglewho tells Willard, ""You're in the asshole of the world.""  Willard keepsencountering leaderless troops, which can be viewed as a metaphor for theVietnam War itself. Keep an eye out for Coppola in a cameo.  He appears as a television directorwho instructs Willard to act natural during a firefight since they arefilming it. The question for reviewers is whether to evaluate APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX onits own or compare it to the original.  Since it has been too long sinceI've seen the original, I'll evaluate it on its own.  It's an incrediblefilm and a classic, but it's not quite perfect.  A lot less of Brando wouldhave been better, and the film's last act isn't as good as the rest of thepicture.  But still it is an amazing achievement worth many viewings.Whatever you do, don't pass on the probably brief opportunity to seeAPOCALYPSE NOW REDUX on the big screen. APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX runs a surprisingly short feeling 3:17 (not includingthe ending credits).  The film is rated R for disturbing violent images,language, sexual content and some drug use and would be acceptable for olderteenagers.",Apocalypse Now Redux,R,2001,4
65," Most screen adaptations of Stephen King novellas fall into themacabre slasher/horror genre, but this evolves into a diabolicallychilling and profoundly disturbing psychological thriller. Adapted byfirst-time screenwriter Brandon Boyce and directed by Bryan Singer,the bizarre story begins in 1984 with a 16 year-old high-school senior(Brad Renfo) who becomes obsessed with the Holocaust in history class,spending hours in the library, immersing himself in documents andphotographs. Then, one day, he spots an elderly man (Ian McKellen) ona bus and recognizes his face from his research. After methodicallyacquiring fingerprints and other evidence, he accosts the accusedformer SS officer with his conclusions and, over the next few months,blackmails the mass murderer into graphically reciting the grisly,gruesome, gory details of his past atrocities in return for preservinghis anonymity. ""Boy, be careful,"" the old man warns. ""You play withfire."" And, true to his word, the crafty ex-Gestapo officer engages inhis own duplicity as an insidious, deadly cat-and-mouse gameevolves. As in his previous film, ""The Usual Suspects,"" Singer neverreveals too much about his characters, so you're not sure exactly whatmotivates the perverse teenager as the tension mounts. ""It's about aboy who became a very good student but not in the way his teachers andmother envisioned,"" concludes the Nazi war criminal.

66,"Before Hitler's program to exterminate the Jews, the Germanleader told his skeptical commanding officers, ""Who remembersthe massacre of Armenians?  He was talking about the programby the Ottoman Turkish government to exterminate its Armeniancitizens in Eastern Turkey, a program that actually begin at theclose of the 19th Century but continued in full, horrendous force in1915 and shortly thereafter, when one million Armenians weremassacred by Turkish troops.  There is a likelihood that even ifthe Turkish government today admitted the role of theirpredecessors eighty-seven years ago (they deny everything), thepublic would not become too aroused given the enormoussuffering brought on by ethnic cleansing sponsored by insanegovernments during the 20th century including those of Rwandaand Bosnia and Cambodia.  To remedy that situation in part,Atom Egoyan goes back to his own Armenian roots and those ofhis wife, Arsinee Khanjian, who plays a major role in Egoyan'slatest, Canadian-made production. ""Ararat,"" named for the mountain that is Armenia's leadingspiritual symbol and whose presence is felt in the film, is adifficult work, difficult not so much in the sense that it requires aknowledge of history (it really doesn't since the scenes ofmassacres are self-explanatory) but that it demands carefulattention to the flawed relationships at the heart of the story. Directed by Egoyan as a film within a film and moving backwardsand forwards as is the Canadian director's wont, ""Ararat"" bites offmore than it can chew.  By putting the present-day humanrelationships in greater importance than the tragic events of 1915-however justifiable in that the present-day affairs can be linkedpsychologically to the holocaust-Egoyan makes us at once wishthat he had concentrated on a full-scale historical film in themanner of other holocaust films this year such as ""The GreyZone,"" ""Amen,"" and ""The Pianist"" or that he had dealt purely witha psychological study in the style of his previous wonderful workssuch as ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and ""Exotica."" Egoyan opens in the present in the home of Philip (BrentCarver) whose father, David (Christopher Plummer) is a customsinspector with whom Philip is having difficulties and regrets theinvitation he extended to his dad.  David, who at his customs postat the airport has recently admitted an Armenian film director andpomegranate lover Edward Saroyan (Charles Aznavour) toCanada, is about to retire but appears to have considerable timeon his hands even while working for his government.   Havingdetained Raffi (David Alpay) on suspicion of carrying drugs in acouple of cans of film, he takes the young man into the back roomfor interrogation and uses the time to learn about-and give us inthe audience-a background to the 1915 massacre. This is Egoyan's ""heaviest"" film to date in the sense  that thereare no words wasted and that each conversation, seeminglybanal, carries the weight of its individual's probing for identity, formeaning, for truth about the holocaust and about his or her ownlife.  Included in the cross-cutting between the film-within-a-filmare Raffi's mother, Ani (Arsinee Khanjian) a professor of art historywho is frequently challenged at her lectures by audience memberswho differ with her interpretations of the past; Philip's male friendAli (Elias Koteas), who is half-Turkish, denies that the holocaustever took place and has gained a major role in Aznavour's film asa sadistic Turkish commander Jevdet Bey; Bruce Greenwood hastaken the role of Usher, an artist whose principal painting decadesago is a ten-year work meant to allow us in the present tomemorialize the massacre. Among the performers, the stand-out is that of a pre-medstudent David Alpay.   Alpay performs in the role of a matureyoung man intent on preserving the memory of the massacre butwho is estranged from his mother and has a complex romanticrelationship with his stepsister, Celia (Marie-Josee Croze). Alpay's role should put him in good standing when various critics'groups vote their awards for Best Debut Performance,''    Whatever its flaws, ""Ararat"" deserves to be seen if only becausethere are few other films dealing with the subject of the murder ofa million people who considered themselves Turkish citizens, asloyal to the Ottomans as the Jews were to Germany, and who areshocked that the people who were supposed to protect them turned on them instead.",Ararat,R,2002,3

For them, Alaskamight have look like a better place to live than Hawaii.However, in the meantime, there were those movies whooffered alternative version of Alaska - closer to the visionof cold, harsh place of Jack London's novels, or thefrontier of an American Wild West. In such wilderness,adventure is still possible, but also close encounters withthe characters who many of us wouldn't like to see in ourneighbourhoods. One of such characters is Ben Corbett(played by Rutger Hauer), hardened trapper who is prone toviolence. In one of such incidents, small row between hisfriends and rival hunters ends with bloodshed. Among all ofthem, Ben is caught and accused of murder. However, beforehe faces trial, he must be transported from isolated town toproper authorities. This is the job for environmentalistEric Desmond (Dylan Walsh), who would soon find thatmurderer's friends are ready to do anything in order to savetheir friend.  When they think about the plot, filmophiles among theaudience would probably find a lot resemblance to theclassic 1957 western 3:10 TO YUMA. Similarities aren'taccidental - this film really looks like western.Unfortunately, faced with somewhat small budget, directorPeter Masterson doesn't direct ARCTIC BLUE like western.Instead, it often baffles audience with shots moreappropriate to experimental video. Screenplay by RossLaManna is bellow par, with clear story diluted with poorlywritten, yet morally ambiguous characters, and also withunnecessary elements of environmentalist propaganda. Castingis also rather bad, especially in the case of awfully ineptRya Kihlstedt in the role of Eric's girlfriend. Luckily,Rutger Hauer, same as in many similar instances lately,saves this basically forgettable piece of low budget cinemawith his screen personality.

68,"      THE ARISTOCATS (1970) is a Disney animated film by directorWolfgang Reitherman.  Reitherman was an animator on a lot of theclassic Disney films (FANTASIA, DUMBO, and LADY AND THE TRAMP amongothers).  THE ARISTOCATS was written by a host of writers (KennethAnderson, Larry Clemmons, Eric Cleworth, Vance Gerry, Julius Svendsen,Frank Thomas, and Ralph Wright) based on a story by Tom McGowan and TomRowe that tells of a family of Parisian felines: mother Duchess (voiceof Eva Gabor) and her three little ones, Berloiz (voice of Dean Clark),Toulouse (voice of Gary Dubin), and Marie (voice of Liz English).       The plot of the movie is quite simple.  The cats live in aParisian mansion owned by Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voice of HermioneBaddeley).  The cats try to become sophisticated aristocrats like theirowner, so they study painting, piano, and singing.  Madame AdelaideBonfamille's butler Edgar (voice of Roddy Maude-Roxey) thinks he willinherit when the old woman dies, but then he comes to believe that shehas left everything to her cats, so he abducts the cats and takes themfar away where they can never be able to return.       Once far away in the country they are befriended by a smart alleycat named Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris).  They are also aidedby a host of other animals including, but not limited to, two redneckdogs named Lafayette (voice of George Lindsey) and Napoleon (voice ofPat Buttram), two silly geese named Abigail Gabble (voice of MonicaEvans) and Amelia Gabble (voice of Carole Shelley), and a sweet littlemouse named Roquefort (voice of Sterling Holloway from MY FAIR LADY).       The film is a musical, but the numbers, while pleasant enough, arenot at all memorable.  The dialog has few good lines and thesetypically come from the sage O'Malley.  He is down on humans as aspecies reflecting, ""Humans don't really worry too much about theirpets.""       The animation is not up to the Disney standards of today, but doeshave interest.  The characters are animated against a flat backgroundwithout realistic lighting.  This is not a problem since the backdropsare artistic ones as befits a movie set in and near Paris.  There areseveral nice visuals.  My favorites is when the geese tell the cats to""think goose"" and force them to all waddle like geese in a line behindthem.  Having cats waddling like geese is a sight gag that works.       The other part of the movie is a love story between O'Malley andDuchess.  This is sweet and low key.  The ending is full of thepsychedelic images from the late 60s when the film was made.  Most ofthe score (George Bruns), on the other hand, is actually upbeat jazzmusic.       THE ARISTOCATS runs just 1:18.  It is rated G, and there isnothing to offend or scare anyone of any age.  Although this is apleasant little film, it is never compelling.  Nice safe homogenousentertainment.  A safe choice at the video store if not a veryinvolving one.  Although my son Jeffrey (age 7) liked it when he saw itfor the first time tonight, I can not quite bring myself to recommendit.  I do give it ** for its pleasantries. ","Aristocats, The",G,1970,2
69,"   This contemporary thriller stars Jeff Bridges as a collegeprofessor whose FBI-agent wife was killed in a botched raid on analleged right-wing cult. The film was scheduled to open in May,shortly after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton,Colorado. With its tagline, ""Fear thy neighbor,"" its release wasunderstandably postponed. The theme revolves around how everydayappearances can be deceiving. This concept is personified by aseemingly normal, all-American couple - Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack -who move with their three children into a suburban Washington,D.C. neighborhood.  Gradually, Bridges, who teaches a course interrorism, senses something suspicious about them. Is he just paranoidor are they part of a lethal, para-military conspiracy?  ""There's nogratuitous violence,"" Bridges says, ""but it does deal with a violentsubject, with militia groups - and how some people express unhappinesstoward the government and their own lives. Certainly, I would hope itdoesn't lead to copycat crimes. However, it's a tough subject: whetherthe arts reflect society or lead society. I don't know if we want toput restrictions on creativity, but, at the same time, we certainly donot want to inspire people to do violence."" Writer Ehren Kruger anddirector Mark Pellington are obviously manipulative as they explorethis volatile subject with a stylish scenario that leads to a grim,uncompromising, over-the-top conclusion. Both Cusack and Robbins seemto relish their intriguing, intimidating roles with an evil glee, andJeff Bridges delivers a solid performance as the tormented widower whobecomes a pawn in their plot to dismantle American society.  On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Arlington Road"" is a sinister, scary6, making you skeptical about anyone's safety. It delivers a chillingshiver on a hot summer's night. ",Arlington Road,R,1999,3.5
70," For all the talk about their shared ""the sky is falling"" theme,_Armageddon_, about an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, can bestbe described as the opposite side of a coin shared by its counterpart, theserious falling comet tale _Deep_Impact_.  That said, on its own, uniqueterms, the slam-bang _Armageddon_ is a reasonably satisfying summerblockbuster, with all the flaws and virtues that come with that label.  In addition to the ""end of the world"" theme, _Armageddon_ and_Deep_Impact_ do have another thing in common: successfully overcoming asetup that borders on the ridiculous.  After a group of top government andscientific advisors determine that the only way to possibly prevent (yes)armageddon is to detonate a nuclear bomb inside the asteroid, NASAexecutive director Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) recruits expert deep-coredriller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, inexplicably speaking in a wildlyinconsistent drawl) and his crew to do the job.  Of course, these drillersaren't astronauts, which means a slow-going hour-long passage in which theroughnecks undergo extensive training and evaluation for their outer spacemission.  A lot of what goes on, including psychological and physical examsand a side trip to a strip club, is supposed to be funny.  But with theexception of a couple of one-liners dryly delivered by thealways-entertaining Steve Buscemi (as horny geologist Rockhound), thecomedy is merely tedious--just as tedious, in fact, as the setup of_Deep_Impact_, but in a different way, ineptly aiming for cheap laughs asopposed to earnestly setting up hokey, all-too-familiar disaster epic plotthreads.  _Armageddon_'s light touch is just one in its long line of differencesfrom its more grave counterpart.  While _Deep_Impact_ was a dramatictreatment of a doomsday scenario, _Armageddon_ takes a gung-ho,action-oriented approach.  Director Michael Bay (who appears fleetingly asa NASA technician) wastes no time putting the special effects dollars towork; before he hits the basic training lull, Bay treats the audience to acurtain-raising space shuttle explosion and a spectacular meteor shower inNew York City.  With this different angle comes a pivotal change ofperspective, focusing on the outer space rescue mission as opposed to_Impact_'s cross-section of Earth dwellers.  So, in essence, it can be saidthat _Armageddon_, with its scrappy crew doing their best to ""fight thefuture,"" is a film about living, not dying, the ominous inevitability ofwhich was the Earth-centered _Impact_'s main issue.  Ultimately, the difference between _Armageddon_ and _Deep_Impact_ can beboiled down to a fundamental one: male and female.  As_Entertainment_Weekly_'s Lisa Schwarzbaum observed in her review, thetouchy-feely _Deep_Impact_ was a ""woman's action movie""; _Armageddon_, fromnotoriously testosterone-heavy producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is clearly onefor the guys.  In addition to all the full-throttle spectacle,_Armageddon_, like all Bruckheimer films, barely has enough time for theonscreen females.  Liv Tyler is prominently featured in the marketingcampaign, but her slim role is merely an amalgam of two cardboard femalestereotypes: rebellious daughter (to Harry) and devoted girlfriend (todriller A.J. Frost, played by Ben Affleck).  There is one female on thespace crew, ballbusting co-pilot Watts (Jessica Steen), but, in typicalBruckheimer fashion, she's literally shoved out of the way at a criticalmoment.  So when _Armageddon_ picks up steam with the shuttle launch at about theone-hour mark, it is momentum of the hard-driving, Hollywood action sortthat takes over, not the subtle, surprising poignance that _Deep_Impact_eventually took on.  Bay, as shown in his previous two films (alsoBruckheimer productions), _Bad_Boys_ and _The_Rock_, is a crack actiondirector, and he successfully generates tension and excitement fromotherwise been-there, done-that situations such as the last-seconddisarming of a ticking bomb (complete with, as Roger Ebert terms them, an""RDR""--red digital display) and a narrow escape from an exploding complex.All of the mayhem comes bathed in Bay's trademark, music-video-honed visualrazzle dazzle, heavy on the quick cuts and slow-mo moments, which keeps theproceedings interesting.  _Armageddon_ is a sturdy popcorn extravaganza; if only Bay and the writingcrew of Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams, Robert Roy Pool, JonathanHensleigh, Tony Gilroy, and Shane Salerno were content to keep it that way. But, seeing they were telling a larger-than-life story (and perhaps swayedby the estrogen of producer Gale Anne Hurd), they decided to go foremotional content to match, with smaller-than-life results.  While there isnothing here nearly as embarrassing as the laughably dreary ""How Do ILive?""-scored reunion between Nicolas Cage and family in _Con_Air_, thegeneral lack of subtlety in _Armageddon_ (and, for that matter, otherBruckheimer productions) prevent the conclusion, which is to supposed to bea profoundly moving, from completely convincing; the ""human drama"" comesoff every bit as calculated as the effects.  Although two films are quite different, in the end the question willalways be ""Is _Armageddon_ better than _Deep_Impact_?""  For me, it's prettymuch a draw, but one that can be decided depending on what it is one wantsto see.  If it's drama, _Deep_Impact_; if it's action, _Armageddon_.  I'dventure to guess that it's the latter quality most moviegoers would go for,and, consequently, the box office answer to the question would be anemphatic yes. ",Armageddon,PG-13,1998,2.5

If Fogg fails, he agreesto dismantle his laboratory and never again practice sciencebecause, as one lord states, everything that can be inventedhas already been offered.   This road-, water- and air-buddy movie is an excuse forCoraci to plunge Passpartout and Fogg and also animpressionist painter they pick up in Paris, Monique (Cecile DeFrance), into life-threatening dangers.

Within the parameters of this genre, THEARRIVAL is a fun and surprisingly good film.  It is funny without everlapsing into self-parody.  Even the hokey plot somehow evolves intosomething bordering on plausibility if you just turn your brain off andgo with the flow.       In the opening, that I worried would be an omen for the audience,scientist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse) looks out on a green field ofwildflowers in the Arctic and proclaims a single sentence, ""Shouldn'tbe here.""

A highly overdrawncharacter to say the least.       Zane works at a Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI)facility.

Zane is nonplused calling his find, ""the premierscientific discovery of the twentieth century.""       As in most B movies, there are a couple of unnecessary romanticsubplots.  Zane can not understand his beautiful wife and successfulstock broker Cher (Teri Polo).  Looking at her he remarks, ""Booleanlogic I trust.  Algorithms I trust.  Beautiful women are beyond me.""       Soon the mysterious holes in the atmosphere that Ilana Green isinvestigating and the communication from outer space that Zane Ziminski(love that name) is digging into, become linked in a massive problemfor the entire planet.  Along the way, the script mixes in a lot ofnatural comedy, both in words and in action.  Zane threatens Gordianwith, ""What do I want to do?  I want to blow a hole in your head anddonate your organs to science, but I've got a few questions first.""Later Gordian warns, ""If you can't tend to your own planet, you don'tdeserve to live here.""  The funniest scene in the show is the bathtubone, which will have you in stitches.  The show is also inventive, agood example of this being how Zane extricates himself when trappedunderground.       THE ARRIVAL runs a little long at 1:55, but it keeps your interestup.  It is rated PG-13.  There is no sex or nudity, and only a littleviolence, mostly of the non-threatening sci-fi variety.  Probably thescariest scene involves big scorpions hidden in Green's bed.

75,"Easily the funniest, most imaginative and perhaps the mostlavish and expensive of the Austin Power trilogy, ""Austin Powersin Goldmember"" is a frantically-paced series of skits looselyanchored by the thinnest of plots.  Featuring parodies of moremovies than you could squeeze on a notebook page in a darktheater including ""Goldfinger,"" ""The Ipcress File,"" ""The ItalianJob"" and even ""Singing in the Rain,"" Jay Roach's collage ofmerry mayhem centers on the enormous talents of MichaelMyers who plays four of the most diverse characters as thoughthey were set apart by but one degree of separation. If you didnot know in advance that the spectacled savior of the world inhis regular nerdy but wholly extroverted persona is also the fivehundred pound character known as Fat Bastard, the billiard-ballbald Dr. Evil, and the diabolical Dutchman called Goldmember(because of an accident that gilded his eponymous phallus),you'd be hard-put to figure that out even if you life depended onit.  There's little doubt that some in the audience who'd not payattention to the end credits might even think that Mini Me, theshow-stealing imp played once again by Verne J. Troyes, is justanother Myers incarnation. Since even the most physical of comedies must have at leasta tissue-thin story around which to base its skits, writers MichaelMcCullers and Myers himself have constructed a time-travel taleconcerning the diabolical Goldmember, whose plan to take overthe world involves the kidnapping of Austin's dad, super-spyNigel Powers (Michael Caine) who had taught Austin all heknew about the cloak-and-dagger game and who has apaternity secret revealed toward the end of the film that bringthe tale to a mock-sentimental conclusion.  To get the help ofhis foxy ex-girl friend, Powers travels back in time to 1975where he picks up the Afro-bedecked Foxxy Cleopatra(Beyonce Knowles) at New York's Studio 69, then moves withher back to our own 2002 so that together they can rescueAustin's dad and foil the plans of Goldmember and the ransom-demanding Dr. Evil who works with a minute alter ego and spit-and-image, Mini Me (Verne J. Troyes). Unlike director Jay Roach's 1997 opener subtitled""International Man of Mystery,"" ""Goldmember"" has a lot moregoing for it than a one-joke premise and happily Myers does notoverextend the hippy argot ""Groovy, Baby"" or ""Yeah Baby"" thistime.  Unlike the second in the series, subtitled ""The Spy WhoShagged Me,"" also directed by Mr. Roach, ""Goldmember""restrains its gross-out gags to a modicum of bathroom humorand just the right touch of sexual innuendo.  Still an originalwhen compared to other  films that rely on physical comedy,""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" has one inventive sceneallegedly occurring outside Tokyo involving the reading ofsubtitles, but Roach has a difficult time besting his supremelyentertaining opener that utilizes a bevy of major Hollywoodcelebrities in some musical shtick that could have come out of""42nd Street.""   Strangely, MGM had opposed the use of the title""Goldmember"" as an infringement of its own James Bondpossession, ""Goldfinger,"" but what's wrong with a little productplacement to call audience attention to the inimitable Bondseries particularly with the upcoming November release of ""Die Another Day?""",Austin Powers In Goldmember,PG-13,2002,2.5

77,"  When M.G.M. refused to screen this tear-jerking May-Decemberromance for critics, it was an ominous sign because studios usuallyhide the star-laden stinkers, hoping to get at least one solid weekendbefore reviews come out. But it's not that bad. It's also not thatgood. Richard Gere plays a 48 year-old, hotshot Manhattan restaurateurwith a reputation as a notorious womanizer and whose picture is on thecover of NEW YORK magazine. Winona Ryder is a giggly, free-spirited,Emily Dickinson-quoting, 22 year-old millinery designer who informshim, shortly after their affair begins, that she's suffering from anextremely rare and probably terminal tumor which affects her heart. Sois it going to be the ""Love Story"" of the millennium year? Probablynot. Heavy-handed screenwriter Allison Burnett is no Erich Segal.First of all, too much is made of the age difference. In fact,according to her cackling grandmother (Elaine Stritch), Gere evendated Ryder's late mother.  Plus, he has an illegitimate daughter(Vera Farmiga) who is Ryder's age, and bartender (Anthony La Paglia)keeps warning him. Even Ryder bluntly quips, ""You've got to look onthe bright side. In a year or so, I'll be this sob story you can useto bag more chicks."" Then there's the soggy dialogue: ""We have nofuture. All I have to offer you is this - until it's over"" and ""Whatshould we do with this moment we're in?"" On the other hand, directorJoan Chen and cinematographer Changwei Gu create such intoxicatinglybeautiful visuals that you forget they're cliche-ridden - like thecloser you come to dying, the more luminous and beautiful youbecome. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Autumn in New York"" isa sentimental, predictable, melodramatic 4, but this glossy,two-hankie weeper at least deserved to find its niche. ",Autumn in New York,PG-13,2000,2
78,"Even after reading the pathetic excuses from the Warner Brothers spin doctors for withholding one of the summers most anticipated films from critics, I went into ""The Avengers"" hoping for the best. Maybe they really had withheld the film so that audiences could ""discover"" it on their own. Sadly, the negative buzz turned out to be true. ""The Avengers"" is a strong candidate for worst movie of the year. In addition, it's absolutely the most dreadful big screen adaptation of a TV series I have ever witnessed, taking the ultra-stylish, clever 60's spy show and turning into a disjointed, garish train wreck of a movie.  So what went wrong? Virtually everything. Let's start with the central characters. As played by Patrick Macnee, John Steed was a conservative, dapper fellow and formidable foe. His droll wit and assured smile reflected the confidence of a consummate renaissance man. In the hands of the usually excellent Ralph Fiennes, Steed merely seems constipated. Wearing a smirk for most of the film, his performance is far too wispy and tentative for a character of such substance.  As for Mrs. Peel, the results are even more painful. Diana Riggs turned the character into the epitome of chic, combining razor sharp intelligence, a keen sense of humor, killer fighting skills and a devastating smoky sexuality. Uma Thurman simply hasn't a clue. While her Mrs. Peel possesses the appropriate looks and wardrobe, everything else is missing. More often than not, she comes off like a coy model or simply a victim.  In the series, the relationship between John Steed and Mrs. Peel simmered beautifully. Here they kiss, effectively killing the romantic and sexual tension the original maintained for years. Imagine if Mulder and Scully had smooched in the first episode of ""The X Files"" and you'll have an idea of the dampening effect this kiss has on the duo.  As for the legendary banter between the characters, most of the lines here are as stilted and leaden as the scripted exchanges between Academy Award presenters before they open the envelopes. What passes for wit is often beyond embarrassing. The film contains a scene where Mrs. Peel falls through a hole in the earth and plummets into the villain's lair. When he greets her, she actually says ""I thought I'd drop in."" This is humor? For God's sake, cartoons don't even use that line anymore!  Speaking of villains, the bad guy here is Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery, in a blustery performance), a megalomaniac bent on taking over the world with a purloined weather-controlling machine. The plot, for lack of a better word, involves clones, criminals dressed as bulky teddy bears, giant mechanical bees, and enough outrageously fake looking snow, cut-rate CGI and cheesy special effects for a dozen low budget syndicated sci-fi TV shows (hell, even the blue screen scenes look phony).   Add a lot of big, showy sets and costumes to the aforementioned mess and what have you got? A disaster strongly resembling last years horrible ""Batman and Robin,"" except that, hard is it may be to believe, this one is even worse. Reportedly, the studio chopped a great deal of footage from the film following disastrous test screenings, resulting in a final 90 minute version that feels like three hours.   The edit renders the comic book plot incomprehensible at times, as characters appear and disappear from various locales for no discernible reason. A perfect example is a scene where Mrs. Peel enters a phone booth on the estate of her enemy and states the code words to trigger a secret entry mechanism. How does she know the villain's code? Why is there a phone booth in the middle of a sprawling estate? And most importantly, how did they take a wicked good TV series and turn it into such a godawful movie?  Stay away from ""The Avengers."" Episodes of the original series are due on video shortly and it's likely that some cable network will rerun the series to capitalize on the publicity from this travesty. Seek out the show and you can enjoy one of the highlights of 60's pop culture entertainment while avoiding one of the low points of the 90's. ","Avengers, The",PG,1998,0
79,"      BABE is a talking animals picture.  Now, don't touch that dial!Don't give up before it has a chance to work its charms on you.  I needto point out that the plot of this movie has a striking resemblance tothe recent major critical bomb called GORDY, but this is not thatmovie.  Moreover, although it starts slow, BABE's inherent sweetnesswill hook you.  It is a hard movie not to like if you do not give upthe ghost in the beginning.       All of the animals in BABE talk, but only to each other and neverto humans.  The animals have a caste system a la ANIMAL FARM.  Each onehas its place and many of them learn that their purpose in life is tobe eaten by their masters.  They are not amused.  Be warned, seriously,that many kids may leave this movie wanting to become vegetarians.  Asfor Jeffrey, he had no problem in consuming his hot dog during theshow.       Babe is a young pig that gets lucky and is spared a trip to thepacking house when her time comes.  She is won by the Hoggett family(James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski), and they take her home to theirfarm to fatten her up for the Christmas dinner.  Babe turns out to beextra smart and soon becomes a sheep dog wannbe.  The movie consists ofthe twists and turns of her life as future bacon vs.  a sheep dogathlete.       The acting by Cromwell is straight out of Grant Wood's ""AmericanGothic"" except here the farm looks English, although it was actuallyfilmed in New South Wales in Australia.  Cromwell gives a monotonic andyet interesting performance at the same time.  A more animated andbetter job is done by Szubanski.  The special effects are realistic andthe voices of the animals are well cast.       The cinematography is the best part of the movie.  Sometimes it isso dramatic you think you are watching Tara in GONE WITH THE WIND.The music score performed by the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra isequally dramatic with loud horns and winds playing in key scenes.  Thescript is by MAD MAX writer George Miller, and it is quite funny inparts.  The movie has about ten different sections and each is namedand the name is sung by three small mice that sound like those singingchipmunks from the 50s.       BABE runs 1:31 which was a little long.  It starts slow, but don'twalk out or give up.  It will work its magic on you.  It is anextremely well crafted show, especially for its genre.  It is correctlyrated G.  There is no sex, nudity, violence, smoking, drinking, or cusswords.  One animal used the word ""butt"" once and my son went wild withlaughter.  Finally, one minor animal does die, but it is handled well.I think any aged kid could see BABE, and I recommend it for them aswell as the young at heart of any age.  Jeffrey (age 6) got a littlescared in a few parts as he frequently does, but loved the show overalland gave it a double thumbs up.  This is a good family film.  It gets** 1/2 in my book. ",Babe,G,1995,3
80,"In a film that is far closer to his roots in filmmaking than 2000's big-budget remake of ""Shaft,"" John Singleton's ""Baby Boy"" is a low-key, often astute, drama. Described as a companion piece to his masterful debut film, 1991's ""Boyz N the Hood,"" the picture is considerably less violent and bleak, but is still set in a world (to be exact, a troubled, crime-ridden Southern California neighborhood) in which its residents can never be too sure if their lives are going to work out as planned, or even if they're going to survive to see tomorrow.  A film about growing up and taking responsibility for your actions and relationships, R&B singer Tyrese Gibson stars as Jody, a 20-year-old ""boy"" who has fathered two children from two separate women (one of which he is in love with), but remains at home living with his lonely 36-year-old mother, Juanita (A.J. Johnson). Juanita loves Jody, but feels that he should ""leave the nest"" and accept becoming an independent man, just as she wants to move on with her own life. Meanwhile, Jody's long-time, long-suffering girlfriend, Yvette (Taraji P. Henson), is beginning to feel like she isn't being appreciated in the relationship as she should be, and suspects that he has been sleeping around. Sure, they love one another, but is love really enough when your significant other almost outwardly cheats behind your back?  John Singleton, whose career has been quite varied (""Boyz N the Hood"" and 1995's ""Higher Learning"" were powerful statements on society, while 1993's ""Poetic Justice"" and 1997's ""Rosewood"" were ambitious blunders), has made a serious-minded, ardent motion picture with ""Baby Boy,"" although it fails to succeed in quite the same way that his greatest achievements have. For one, Singleton, who also penned the screenplay, too often goes for over-exaggeration when dealing with his characters' mannerisms, and the path that the movie follows is an admittedly cliched one. While it may be truthful up to a point, the actors are instructed to yell their lines in certain scenes, rather than just speak them in a normal tone, as if to be black you have to have a nasty temper and be sassy. While this aspect of the characters' interaction is unnecessary, it thankfully does not takes up the majority of the running time.  For much of the 128-minute running time, ""Baby Boy"" is an involving romantic drama that treats its participants with respect and understanding, never fully condemning them for their mistakes. Jody, played maturely by Tyrese Gibson in his first film role, is a likable, sympathetic young man, even when he makes mistakes and isn't always faithful to Yvette. In one of the movie's most powerful moments, following Yvette's discovery that he has been with many different women, Jody earnestly explains that he hasn't been honest with her because he actually does love her and didn't want to hurt her feelings. The same goes for Jody's mother, Juanita, who begins to see, and subsequently falls in love with, a man named Melvin (Ving Rhames), who is a reformed gangster. Juanita's last twenty years have all been dedicated to Jody, and now that he is an adult, she simply wants to move on and enjoy her own life, for once. A.J. Johnson (1994's ""The Inkwell"") gives a powerful performance as a woman who loves her son unconditionally, but wants, and needs, to let him go. As for Ving Rhames (2000's ""Mission: Impossible 2""), his sure-to-be-remembered frog-hopping sex scene has got to be seen to be believed.  Newcomer Taraji P. Henson has the most interesting and finely-tuned role, as Yvette, and runs away with the entire film. Henson is a lovely fresh face whose performance is both perceptive and touching, and Yvette is written with an intelligent delicacy that makes you instantly care about what happens to her. It's the trickiest role, too, as a young mother who is trying to make a good life for her and her son, and would love to include Jody in it if only he could show her some commitment.  The plot takes a wrong turn with the appearance of Yvette's criminal ex-boyfriend, Rodney (Snoop Dogg), who is released from jail and promptly takes over Yvette's apartment. Not sure how to get him out, and scared of his dangerous streak, the film culminates in a false-alarm drive-by shooting that later turns to real violence. While what takes place is captivating, and even effective in the issues it raises, the appearance of guns in the final act of an otherwise non-violent motion picture was a bit of a letdown. Snoop Dogg, who is fine with what he has been given, is equipped with a character who is portrayed as less of a person, and more of an obnoxious story device. Luckily, once he is out of the picture, the film concludes with several extremely well-written passages that wrap up the film in a hopeful, satisfying manner.  ""Baby Boy"" is not a great movie, and lacks the overall realism and intensity of ""Boyz N the Hood,"" but it is a good one. The engaging performances, mixed with its keen observations on love and maturation, are worth seeing, even if, in order to get to them, you must walk down a road that has been covered many times before. It is clear that when he set out to make ""Baby Boy,"" John Singleton's heart was in the right place. ",Baby Boy,R,2001,2.5
81,"      BABYFEVER is a Henry Jaglom movie, and his movies are an acquiredtaste.  Probably the best of them was ALWAYS (1985) which should not beconfused with Spielberg's ALWAYS (1989) with Holly Hunter.  Jaglom'sALWAYS was a pseudo-documentary about the signing of his divorce papersand has a subtitle of BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOREVER.  He has a weekendlong party and invites his soon to be ex over along with all of theirfriends.  It was one of my favorite movies of the 80s.       Jaglom's movies star his friends and relatives.  The star inBABYFEVER is his wife, the actress Victoria Foyt, and BABYFEVER is heronly movie.  Jaglom's style is that of a homemade documentary where theactors and actresses are told to act like they are not acting.  Hisplots are usually semi-autobiographical.  In BABYFEVER, he was thedirector, writer, producer, and editor.  He did not appear in the moviewhich surprised me since he is usually in his pictures.       BABYFEVER is a movie about women, especially those over 35 or 40,who get an obsession with having a baby.  The movie has 12 starringwomen plus 3 men who appear in minor roles.  Almost all of the moviehappens during a 2 hour baby shower.  There is a movie within the movieof a documentary of the women talking one-on-one with the camera abouttheir inner thoughts on wanting a baby.       To add a bit of comic relief, there is a side plot about the""rich"" husband whose house is being used for the shower.  It seems heis a real estate wheeler dealer who has many possession but a largenegative net worth.  It implodes on him during the shower.       The movie within the movie is great.  The women are very funny andinsightful with many great lines.  Most of them talk about how muchthey want to find a man so they can have a baby and how theirbiological clock is running out on them.  Some of the best linesinclude a woman who says she feels like going to the supermarket andshouting over the loudspeaker ""Attention shoppers, attention shoppers,I am ovulating now, I am ovulating NOW!"" Another woman, says that whena guy asks her out to dinner, her thought is: ""Dinner, I don't needdinner.  I've tried that - it does no good.  That is not what I want, Iwant a baby."" There is another scene where the women argue about whohas the fewest number of eggs left.  These one-on-one interviews arefascinating, and I can easily recommend this part of the show.       Most of the movie however consists of the awkward acting anddialog of the shower itself.  This part is trite and tedious.  Thewheeler dealer subplot is kind of a nice diversion but nothing special.       As someone who was married for 20 years before deciding to have achild (and succeeding), and someone who spent many years unsuccessfullytrying to have a second, I can really identify with the issuesdiscussed.  All of the techniques, operations, and drugs they discussmay sound foreign to some, but sounded familiar to me.       It is a close call, but I can not recommend the movie because themain part was too banal and poorly acted.  Rent it in a few months andwatch only the interviews.  Overall, I rate it **. ",Babyfever,R,1994,2
82,"If you've heard of Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, and their old ""beach party"" movies from the 1960's, such as 65's ""Beach Blanket Bingo,"" then you know the definition of the word corny. Those beach films may have been kinda fun and harmless, but they were also undeniably dumb. Then in 1987, Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello returned to their ""beach party"" movies, and made the best film they could have possibly done.  ""Back to the Beach"" stars Avalon and Funicello, playing their screen images, as a married couple living in Ohio. Avalon seems to have lost his spontaneity and is now an uptight car dealer, while Funicello is a spunky housewife who has an obsession with peanut butter. Together, they have two kids, a daughter, Cindi (Lori Loughlin) in her early twenties living in Malibu, and a teenage son named Bobby (Demian Slade) who dresses like a punk. At the start of the film, they realize that they desperately need a vacation, so while on their way to Hawaii, they stop over in Malibu to see Cindi, not knowing that her fiance (Tommy Hinckley) is living with her on a pier at the beach. After they get there, Annette and Frankie get in a fight when he meets up with an old pal from the beach, Connie Stevens, and appears to be having more fun with her. Figuring into the story are various musical numbers, a surfing contest, and, yes, beach parties.  By hearing the premise, ""Back to the Beach"" may sound exactly like Funicello's and Avalon's old movies, but it is not at all. ""Back to the Beach,"" in fact, is one of the most entertaining comedy musicals I have ever seen, and is one of those movies that can be watched over and over (and I've seen it many times, to be sure).  One of the biggest surprises of the film is that the movie is a little bit more edgy than expected. Funicello and Avalon are good sports, and actually satirize their images to humorous effect. Funicello, especially, is so purely good and sweet that she is absolutely entertaining to watch. Stealing the opening scenes of the film is Demian Slade, who is hilarious as their punk son. Remarking about his parent's dim-witted conversations, heobserves, ""It's like a conversation at the Kissinger's.""  The music in ""Back to the Beach"" is perhaps the main star of the picture, and every song is memorable and fun to listen to. The musical numbers are also well choreographed and they give off a lot of spark and joy.   ""Back to the Beach"" is, by no means, a deep and thought-provoking motion picture. It knows that it is only a ""beach"" movie, and it makes the most of it by adding a winning, lightweight screenplay, charming performances by the whole cast, a delightful array of cameos (ranging from Barbara Billingsley to David Bowie to Pee Wee Herman), and some great music. And when you're dealing with Frankie and Annette, what more could you ask for? ",Back To The Beach,PG,1987,3
83,"1995's ""Bad Boys"" was a relatively small-scale action-comedy thatbecame a sleeper hit at the box office, benefiting from the charismaticpairing of Martin Lawrence (2003's ""National Security"") and Will Smith(2002's ""Men in Black II""), who played well off each other. It wasno great shakes, to be sure, pretty typical in style and content,but it got the job done. Eight years have passed, and times have mostcertainly changed. In today's world of action sequels, what was oncebig has to be bigger, louder, and more spectacular. ""Bad Boys II,""once again directed by Michael Bay (2001's ""Pearl Harbor""), fits allof these requirements and then some. For example, it is also moreridiculous, more sloppy, more violent, more tasteless, and--most unnecessaryof all--42 minutes longer. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) arelong-time friends and partners working for Miami's Narcotics PoliceDivision. They latest case involves bringing down Johnny Tapia (JordiMolla), a big-time Cuban drug smuggler specializing in Ecstasy. Alsoentering the picture is Marcus' younger sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union),a DEA Agent working undercover on the same case, who has secretlybegun a relationship with Mike behind Marcus' back. Overblown carchases, explosions, and shoot-outs ensue, leaving everyone for dead(including countless innocent bystanders) except the questionable good guys. ""Bad Boys II"" starts off innocently mediocre enough, with a first-actcar chase that offers nothing new from the countless other car chasesthis summer, but nonetheless is an adrenaline-fueled diversion. Butthen, as the minutes--no, make that hours--tick by, the movie digsitself a grave deep enough to bury every last one of the victims ofthe Titanic. Mean-spirited and brain-dead in the extreme, the filmpatronizingly tries to pass itself off as an action-packed popcornentertainment when, in fact, every last bone in its body is hateful,offensive, and sickening. Take, for example, the sequence in which Marcus and Mike chase a vanfull of cadavers, as the lifeless bodies drop to the road one by oneand are gruesomely run over and decapitated. Or, how about the scenein which the duo suspect the drugs are being hid inside the corpses,and proceed to tear them open and root around inside, tearing outorgans right and left and cracking jokes all the while? Funny enoughfor you? Another scene, which has nothing to do with the progressingthe story, depicts Marcus and Mike ganging up on Marcus' teenage daughter'sdate, ruthless berating the innocent child and sticking a gun on him.If Mike and Marcus were meant to be the villains of the piece, thenthey would be the most evil characters to come along since HannibalLecter sliced open Ray Liotta's skull and fed his own brain to him(by the way, there is a scene in which Mike and Marcus are involvedin something alarmingly similar). Because they are supposed to bethe heroes, and apparently have no value for human life outside oftheir family's, their actions only make them more despicable. As in the original, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith make wisecracksand seem to be having fun with each other, which is amazing if onlydue to all the blood and body parts that are continuously flying theirway. As Syd, the effervescently talented Gabrielle Union (2003's ""DeliverUs from Eva"") struggles through the shallow material, popping up longenough to shoot a gun and make googly eyes at Smith's smooth-talkingMike. Theresa Randle and Joe Pantoliano (2003's ""Daredevil"") reprisetheir roles as Marcus' wife and he and Mike's boss, but their scenesare so threadbare and sporadic as to practically seem nonexistent. In the eyes of director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer,why just shoot a person in the head when you can then let them fallon a landmine, graphically blowing them up into itsy-bitsy pieces?This sort of thinking is, in general, all well and good when you havehundreds of millions of dollars at your disposal, but it is shamefulwhen this sort of action and violence ceases being fun and turns downrightmalicious. ""Bad Boys II,"" more than any other motion picture in recentmemory, holds zero value for human life and nary a thought in itspuny brain. As skillfully made as it is from a technical outlook,it is just as disastrous on every other conceivable level. Special Note: Since I already brought up the idiocy and inconsistenciesof the MPAA system once this week in my ""Johnny English"" review, Imight as well do it again. ""Bad Boys II"" is as violent, gruesome,and graphically repugnant as any R-rated film I can remember seeing,while 2001's ""L.I.E.,"" a coming-of-age film with mild (but not graphic)sexual content, was rated NC-17. This is further proof that violenceand careless death in film is A-okay, but any sort of genuine humanconnection on a sexual level is off-limits. Where, I ask you, is the logic in this?",Bad Boys II,R,2003,1.5
84,"To get a general idea of how stunningly inept ""Ballistic: Ecks vs.Sever"" is, take a good look at its name: there are two separate titlesto be found, and neither makes any sense in relation to the film'sstoryline. ""Ballistic?"" Purely generic, direct-to-video fare. ""Ecksvs. Sever?"" These two lead characters aren't even fighting each other;they're on the same side! As dumbfoundedly plotted and joylessly executedas a big-budget action flick could possibly be, the only entertainmentone may be able to pull out of suffering through 89 minutes of ""Ballistic:Ecks vs. Sever"" is a helping handful of hearty, unintended laughs.  The basic premise--or what there is of it--tells of mopey FBI agentJeremiah Ecks (Antonio Banderas), who is promised new informationabout his allegedly deceased wife (Talisa Soto) in return for investigatingthe kidnapping of fellow agent Gant's (Gregg Henry) son. The kidnapper,it turns out, is ruthless DIA agent Sever (Lucy Liu), a deadly martialarts and weapon expert who is actually out to save the young boy andkill the crooked Gant. When Ecks discovers that his wife is aliveand well, after all, remarried to the backstabbing Gant, he teamsup with Sever to stop Gant once and for all. A key plot point involvinga microchip that fits into a person's body and has the power to killthem is so preposterous I dare not utter another word about it. As a whole, ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"" directed by Wych Kaosayananda(Kaos, for short), is so ridiculous it has to be seen to be believed,though such an idea would be ill-advised. How such a hyper-stylized,action-packed film filled with more explosions than any other movieI've ever seen could manage to be mercilessly boring is a feat worthmarveling. There is no immediacy to the proceedings, no excitement,no rooting interest, and no driving force offered for why the viewershould invest time and care into any of it. If Kaos should have learnedone thing from his experiences on ""Ballistic,"" we can only hope itwas that a nonstop avalanche of nifty pyrotechnics does not a successful action pic make.  Not helping matters are the usually reliable Antonio Banderas (2002's""Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"") and Lucy Liu (2000's ""Charlie'sAngels""), whose yawn-inducing portrayals of Ecks and Sever suggestthey were heavily medicated on Dramamine for the duration of the filmshoot. Banderas sulks and looks earnest, but there is no flair ordepth to his assortment of frowns. Meanwhile, Liu has a total of aboutten lines of dialogue (if that), doing nothing but running aroundthe city of Vancouver while putting to destructive use her arsenalof bombs, guns, and missiles. Curious, how Sever can blatantly hoverabove a highway overpass with a huge missile in hand, and none ofthe cars below even flinch. Funny, too, how she lives in a literalunderground lair that looks every bit as cliched as the term suggests. Coming from any viewpoint possible, ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" ishorrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visuallyugly when it isn't incomprehensible, and offensively one-note whenit isn't unintentionally humor-filled. Plot holes too large and numerousto disregard litter every corner of the story, as does one tediousexplosion after the next. What Banderas, Liu, or anyone else saw inthis project is not even hinted at in the finished product. In making""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"" director Kaos has proven his sheer disrespectfor the intelligence of mainstream audience members. To him, we arenot merely viewers, but genuine fools. ",Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,R,2002,0.5

BAMBOOZLED, by acclaimed writer/director/producer Spike Lee (MALCOLM X), is a preachy and pretentious social satire, featuring black-faced minstrels, that's quite embarrassing and never funny.  The acting, worthy of an amateur improvisational group, is awkward with a capital A.  And the film is extra long so that Lee can beat us over the head with his message.  Easily the worst film of his career, it is so full of bad racial stereotypes that if a white filmmaker had made it -- remember the flack Ted Danson got for attempting black-faced humor -- the movie would probably be picketed.  In a stilted, unrealistic and unconvincing performance, Damon Wayans stars as Pierre Delacroix, the only black writer for an upstart television network.

86,"It is a known fact that actresses over 40, and definitely over 50,have a difficult time finding quality roles in the realm of Hollywood.While male actors can play romantic leads even in their 60's and 70's(Clint Eastwood and Warren Beatty spring immediately to mind), thereis a double standard that proves middle-aged woman don't have halfthe chance. Because of this crutch, it might be easy to forget howvery good some of them were, and still are, if only given the chance to shine. ""The Banger Sisters,"" written and directed by Bob Dolman, is not agreat movie. It is decidedly cliched on the screenplay level and unevenin its handling of the characters, some of which aren't given nearlyenough screen time to develop fully developed personalities. Whatthe film does make an indelible point in demonstrating, however, isjust how engaging, sexy, and funny female characters outside of the18-35 age bracket have the ability to still possess.  Suzette (Goldie Hawn) and Lavinia (Susan Sarandon) were once the bestof friends, infamous rock groupies who delighted in the sex, drugs,and music culture of the time period. Twenty years later, things havechanged. While the vivacious Suzette still desperately clings to thekind of lifestyle she once lead, she is given a harsh reality checkwhen she is fired from her longtime job as a bartender at the hardrock nightspot, Whiskey-A-Go-Go. Broke and with no one to turn to,Suzette sets off for Phoenix, where Lavinia, whom she has not seenin years, has settled down into the straight-laced wife of a lawyer(Robin Thomas) and mother to two spoiled teenage daughters, Hannah(Erika Christensen) and Ginger (Eva Amurri). Following an initialconfrontation in which Lavinia makes it perfectly clear she does notwant her past life exposed to her unsuspecting family, Suzette isa too-tempting reminder of Lavinia's long bottled-up true self. Goldie Hawn (2001's ""Town & Country"") is the flame that burns brightestin ""The Banger Sisters."" The movie is worth seeing for Hawn alone,and this is, by far, the juiciest role she has been blessed with inages. As the wild, extroverted Suzette whose insecurities in lifehave begun to bubble just beneath the surface, the spectacular-lookingHawn relishes every frame she is onscreen, exhibiting crackerjackcomic timing and a truthful reality to her aging persona. Pairing Hawn with Susan Sarandon (1999's ""Anywhere But Here"") wasa masterstroke on the casting director's part, as they both work sofluidly together that it is immediately believable that they are oldbest buddies rekindling the spark they once had together. Sarandonhas never given anything less than a focused performance, and ""TheBanger Sisters"" is no exception, even when her character of Laviniahas a too-sudden change in the second half, reverting back to her once-edgy ways. The central premise is so solid, particularly due to Hawn and Sarandon,that a subplot involving an eccentric, depressed screenwriter namedHarry (Geoffrey Rush) that Suzette picks up on her way to Phoenixseems extraneous. While there are some sparklingly funny moments betweenGoldie Hawn and Geoffrey Rush (1999's ""House on Haunted Hill""), theirbudding relationship takes up far too much time at the onset whenthe film should be getting to the reunion of Suzette and Lavinia. Director Bob Dolman spices up his unfocused screenplay with wickedlyfunny and surprisingly explicit dialogue and visual humor. Gettingto hear Hawn speak her mind about her past and present sexual escapadesare a treat, and fleshes Suzette out as an uncensored force to be reckoned with. As Lavinia's pampered daughters, Erika Christensen (2002's ""Swimfan"")and Sarandon's real-life offspring Eva Amurri do much more with theirundernourished roles than was required by the writing. Less successfulis Robin Thomas (2002's ""Clockstoppers"") who, as Lavinia's husband,remains more of a spectator than a participant in the goings-on. Thomasis never allowed to give the viewer as sense of who his characteris, and what his feelings are concerning Lavinia's past and future. Despite a need for some tightening in its finished screenplay, ""TheBanger Sisters"" is a refreshing comedic outing because its outrageousnessand candid attitude are at the service of two vital, extraordinaryleading ladies and quite a few emotional truths. The film doesn'tnecessarily lead up to much in the long run, but being in the companyof Hawn and Sarandon at the top of their games for 98 minutes neveronce wears out its welcome.","Banger Sisters, The",R,2002,2.5

He doesn'twalk out.  On the contrary, when invited to leave the firm, hesays simply, ""I prefer not to.""  Herman Melville's short story,written in 1851 just three years after Karl Marx in Germanywrote about the alienation of labor in ""The CommunistManifesto"" is a black comedy, a surreal examination of thefailure of most work to satisfy man's creative impulse.  WhileMarx railed against the division of labor in German factories, theinability of anyone on an assembly line to feel a sense that hehas really made something worthwhile, Melville dramatized thesame alienation in the office.  Melville wrote what he knew,having worked not only on the whaler ""Acushnet"" which formedthe basis of his Great American Novel ""Moby Dick"" but also onjobs as a bank messenger and clerk in a customs house. Remember that offices in his day were not automated likemodern setups.  To make ""Bartley"" relevant to a contemporaryaudience, writer-director Jonathan Parker set up a small officesituated, as so many modern workplaces are today, in a remoteareas.  In fact the company owned and headed by The Boss(David Paymer) could pass for a large gas station cum cafeteriaon the New York State Thruway.     Employing the cartoon look evoked by pastel walls, directorJonathan Parker takes us into the little world of The Boss, apublic records firm with a generous contract by the city, and astaff of paper shufflers with distinct personalities.  Vivian(Glenne Headly), is a seductive woman with a pretentious (andfunny) vocabulary; Rocky (Joe Piscopo), a relic of the 1950's, asingle man regularly bragging about his women.  Ernie (MauryChaykin) is a slovenly worker, loyal nonetheless, who would notlast a week in a major firm.  When The Boss needs anotherhand to help with the work generated by the city contract, hesets up for the movie audience one of the most obviousexamples of alienation in this case between the advertisementin the newspaper and the typical reader stating spuriously thathe is looking for an adventurous sought willing to take risks (likea whaler perhaps), when the truth is that he is offering a lowpaying job that is as dull as the dishwater on the ""Acushnet.""     Though his new hire, Bartleby (Crispin Glover), works out justfine for a week, filing papers in record time, The Boss becomesincreasingly concerned when Bart simply refuses to do certainjobs.  Asked to verify the accuracy of a document, Bartleyreplies, ""I prefer not to.""  Pretty soon everyone in the office isusing the word ""prefer"" as frequently as an American 20-year-old uses ""like.""     In his own adaptation of the Melville novella, Jonathan Parkerand his co-writer, Catherine Di Napoli, have evoked theoriginality, complexity, psychological penetration and symbolicrichness of Melville himself.  Crispin Glover is perfectly cast asthe increasingly distant character who eventually gives upworking altogether to stare at the air conditioner vent.  UnlikeDidi and Gogo of Beckett's play ""Waiting for Godot,"" Glover'stitle character is not even waiting for anyone, but prefers to lookmore and more like a statue in Mme Toussaud's museum. David Paymer is likewise a casting coup as a man whobecomes increasingly frustrated with this enigmatic employeeand is gradually taken to empathize with Bartley and, byextension, to realize his own role in generating meaninglesswork.       What Parker has accomplished by updating the novella ofsome 150 years ago is to give a modern audience the samefeeling that Melville's own readership had in the mid-19thcentury the idea that post-industrial revolution work isunsatisfying, engaged in by people who are all just playing thegame in order to get the money to live. ",Bartleby,NR,2001,3
90,"Although historical examples and even some current eventsprovide plenty of examples in which violent acts areinspired by various things, including ancient religioustexts, in 1990s Hollywood movies and other forms of popularculture seemed to be the sole source of the violence inAmerican society. At least this was the impression given bymedia crusade, inspired by the series of school shootings inlate 1990s America, for which the young perpetrators hadallegedly found inspiration in violent films from Hollywood.Among various titles the one is particularly singled becauseof the scene that actually featured one of such shootings -THE BASKETBALL DIARIES, 1995 teen angst drama directed byScott Kalvert.  The shooting is nothing but the vision in the mind of thefilm's protagonist Jimmy (played by Leonardo di Caprio),16-year old boy who lives in Manhattan with his mother(played by Lorraine Bracco). Jimmy is star of St. Vitus,seemingly unbeatable high school basketball team, andeveryone expects that he would continue his stardom in NBA.However, Jimmy, being rebellious teenager, has increasingproblems adapting to the repressive and hypocriticalatmosphere of Catholic high school, as well as dealing withhis own broken home and best friend Bobby (played by MichaelImperioli) dying from leukemia. In order to escape from itall Jimmy finds refuge in casual sex and drug use. Thelatter proves to be his undoing - his basketball skillsquickly vanish, he leaves school and home and is soon forcedto leave on the street where he commits various crimes andsells his body in order to pay for his heroin habit.  Based on the autobiographical novel by former heroin addict,rocker and poet Jim Carroll, THE BASKETBALL DIARIES provideuniquely naturalistic and explicit portrayal of thedestructive capabilities of heroin addiction. Leonardo diCaprio, in its uncompromising and convincing portrayal ofpromising teenager who ends up like a basket case wouldforever silence all those who see him as nothing more than apretty boy. His strong performance is matched by equallyimpressive supporting roles. Lorraine Bracco excels in therole of Jim's mother, especially in one particularly movingscene that feature final split-up of the family, while JamesKirby stands out with the extremely effective portrayal ofcreepy basketball coach. Juliette Lewis is also veryconvincing in the role of street junkie, and that rolebecomes even more interesting when we know that the actresshad some real-life drug problems after the production ofthis film.  THE BASKETBALL DIARIES had misfortune of being released inthe same year as two otherfilms that dealt with similarsubjects - Danny Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING and Larry Clark'sKIDS. While the former dealt with the dark world of heroinaddiction with much more details and style than THEBASKETBALL DIARIES, the latter was much more convincing inthe depiction of modern teenager's alienation from society.This is actually major problem of the film - script by BryanGoluboff (which set the plot in modern day instead of late1960s like the novel) switches direction in the middle;until that moment it is an honest and intriguing portrayalof young man and his relationship with society; afterwardsit turns into sometimes oversimplistic anti-drug film.Director Scott Kalvert also tends to show his videoclipauthor's root too much. The happy ending also seems a littlebit cliched, although it owes more to real life than to thefilmmakers' lack of imagination. However, despite not beingamong the best film that deal with this grim and disturbingsubjects, THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is nevertheless aremarkable film that just had misfortune of getting wrongreputation. ","Basketball Diaries, The",R,1995,2.5
91,"      If a producer had ever been foolish enough to give Ed Wood(director of arguably the worst movie ever made, PLAN 9 FROM OUTERSPACE) a hundred million dollars, the result could well have been thisBATMAN & ROBIN.       In summer Hollywood studios usually figure that big budget actionpictures will sell regardless of quality.  But even with diminishedexpectations, BATMAN & ROBIN is surprisingly bad.  It insults theviewer's intelligence with lifeless acting and a tired script.  In ourpacked advanced screening, there was excitement in the air before thefilm started.  But after the lights went down, the audience stared inalmost silent disbelief at a film that was so DOA.       The third Batman movie, BATMAN FOREVER, which felt like it went onforever, had the misfortune to have been directed by Joel Schumacher.Schumacher appears to turn control of his action pictures over to thespecial effects department, and he takes an MTV rock video approach tothe filmmaking.  The fourth in the Batman series, BATMAN & ROBIN, againhas Schumacher as the director. This time he manages to badly miscastthe roles of Batman and Robin and then coach Arnold Schwarzenegger intogiving the worst performance of his career.       From the film's opening line of ""The Iceman Cometh,"" bySchwarzenegger as Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze, the dialog itself is frozen.The show features bad acting masquerading as camp.  Mr. Freeze's linesare spoken staccato style, and all of the cast speaks withoutintonation.  Less like acting than the reading aloud one would expectfrom a second grader.       The sets by Barbara Ling and the costumes by Ingrid Ferrin, BobRingwood, and Robert Turturice are quite colorful.  There are theprimary colors of the save-the-rain-forest benefit as well as scenes ofblue gray ice.  Savor these elements of the picture for they are allthat is worthwhile.  Had I not been there to review the film I wouldhave walked out after five minutes, literally.  It is that bad.       If you think George Clooney is an unlikely and unpromising choicefor Batman, you are right.  Whereas Michael Keaton was quirky and ValKilmer was outlandish and brooding, Clooney gives such aninconsequential performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman that he blends intothe background.       Chris O'Donnell suffers the same problem.  As Dick Grayson/Robin,it is easy to forget he is even on the set.       The other leads, Uma Thurman as Pamela Isley/Poison Ivy and AliciaSilverstone as Barbara Wilson/Batgirl, had promise, but again,Schumacher manages to modulate their work and quickly to get to therepetitive stunts.  Akiva Goldsman's script gives the two women thesame throwaway lines as the rest of the cast.  (""Come with me,"" teasesPoison Ivy to Robin.  ""My garden needs tending."")       As I sat frozen as if by Mr. Freeze's big gun, I whiled away thetime suffering through BATMAN & ROBIN wondering if there was any movieI enjoyed less this year.  Although I could not recall all 137 movies Ihave seen this year, I could not think of any that were worse.       ""If I must suffer, humanity will suffer with me,"" warns Mr.Freeze.  And so will BATMAN & ROBIN's audiences.       BATMAN & ROBIN runs two long hours.  It is rated PG-13 forcartoonish violence and sexual innuendoes.  The film would be fine forkids around 8 or 9 and up, but I recommend seeing anything else.  Incomparison to BATMAN & ROBIN the summer's other action pictures looklike masterpieces.  If you do go, bring an interesting watch; you aregoing to be looking at it frequently.  I thought about giving the filmno stars, but decided I would give it one half of a star for the sets.Even so, I think I am being too generous. ",Batman & Robin,PG-13,1997,1

For director he tapped JoelSchumacher, whose only halfway decent film was THE CLIENT.       BATMAN FOREVER has nothing new to say.  As usual, there are a setof villains: D.  A.  Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent (Tommy Lee Jones) andEdward Nygma - The Riddler (Jim Carrey) and good guys: Dr.  ChaseMeridian (Nicole Kidman) and Commissioner Gordon (Pat Hingle).  Thistime we have Chris O'Donnell playing Dick Grayson - Robin.  The biggestdifference of all is Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne - Batman rather thanMichael Keaton.       The plot, you ask?  Why do you ask?  If you have seen one Batman,you have seen them all.  I will not cover the plot as its existence isirrelevant.  One sees Batman to sneer at the villains and watch all ofthe gadgetry and stunts.  Almost every scene requires the suspension ofdisbelief in order to watch it.       The script is full of one liners that end in ""ha ha ha"" just tomake sure that you know it is supposed to be a joke.  Moreover, thedirector has the actors get all wild eyed to make absolutely sure youknow it is a joke.  Perhaps, Batman has always been this way, but thestyle has outlined ability to charm or interest an audience.  Theaudience in the theater I was at had about as much interest in themovie as Val Kilmer did, which is almost none.  He sleepwalked throughmost of the movie.  Even at that, his performance was much better thanKidman's who was unable to demonstrate she could act at all, and basedon her previous movies, I would say the jury is still out on thatquestion anyway.       The sets by Barbara Ling and the cinematography by StephenGoldblatt were in the usual dark and foreboding Batman style.  Grantedthey were not as sinister as in BATMAN or BATMAN RETURNS, nevertheless,they were pretty depressing.       I understand that Robin Williams was offered the role of TheRiddler, but Tim Burton got frustrated when Williams would not make uphis mind if he wanted to take the part or not and gave it to Carreyinstead out of frustration.  Frankly, I think Williams's style of humorwould have enlivened the show some, and I am sorry he did not agree todo the part.       BATMAN FOREVER seemed liked it ran forever.  The editing by DennisVirkler was fast paced, but had too much material at 2:00.  I was boredfrom the beginning.  It is correctly rated PG-13 for comic violence andsexual references.  I would not let kids under 13 see it, but therewere a fair number of 8 year olds and above in the audience when I sawit.  I do not recommend the movie, and I award it a single star solelyfor the gadgets.  I hope Tim Burton realizes that the Batman formula istired, and it is time to bury it.  I do hope that next year we do nothave BATMAN AD NAUSEAM as yet another blockbuster attempt. ",Batman Forever,PG-13,1995,2
93,"THE BACKGROUND AND THE CONTROVERSY: Since 1975, John Travolta has beenan outspoken devotee of Scientology, an ""applied religious philosophy""that claims to have millions of followers. Travolta credits itsfounder, L. Ron Hubbard, for all his spiritual and worldly success andfervently believes that Hubbard's writings, particularly ""Dianetics,""contains mankind's hope for salvation. Hubbard taught that Earthlingsare the pawns of aliens. He preached that psychiatry was a timelessevil, that, in a distant galaxy, alien ""psychs"" devised implants thatwould ultimately wreck the spiritual progress of humans. The psychsand their ""blackened souls"" are to blame for sin, violence, andcrime. In addition to his religious writing, Hubbard also wrotescience-fiction and, for 15 years, Travolta has been trying bring thisHubbard tale to the screen. But Scientology is controversial, teachingthat a ""suppressive"" person deserves no mercy. He may be ""tricked,lied to, sued, deprived of property, injured or destroyed by any meansby any Scientologist.""  A California appeals court calledScientology's treatment of a member ""manifestly outrageous,"" awardinghim $2.5 million for ""serious emotional injury,"" a ruling that wastwice upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, yet the litigant has nevercollected. In France, last November, Scientology staff members wereconvicted of fraud. And a German court ruled that Scientology used""inhuman and totalitarian practices."" Disaffected Scientologists fearthat this movie will entice believers and reinforce Hubbard'santi-psychiatry message. Indeed, in the ""New York Daily News,"" JohnTravolta acknowledged his mission saying, ""If we can't do the thingsnow that we want to do, what good is the power? Let's try to get thethings done that we believe in.'""  THE REVIEW: In post-apocalyptic 3000, mankind is an endangeredspecies. Alien Psychlos rule, enslaving the ""man-animals"" they captureas they strip the planet of its mineral resources. The villainous Terl(John Travolta) is the Psychlo Chief of Security - a huge, snarling,dreadlock'd, fearsome creature. The hero is Jonnie Goodboy Tyler(Barry Pepper), a human hunter who leaves his mountain hideout,determined to discover who the demonic Psychlos really are and how todefeat them. Remember ""The Postman""? Well, that's the ambiance - onlythere's no Kevin Costner. It's a mythic good guys vs. bad guys storybut Corey Mandell's screenplay, based on Hubbard's book, has so manysappy cliches and ludicrous, far-fetched loopholes that they inciteunintentional laughter. For example, Tyler is a primitive caveman,barely able to communicate, yet he discovers a library and is able toassimilate all its knowledge immediately. He then dupes the Psychlosinto believing he's mining a mountain but substitutes gold bricks fromFt. Knox which, curiously, the ore-hungry Psychlos have neverdiscovered. And, finally, Tyler's rebellious cohorts from thesubterranean dungeons jump into Harrier jets - which have not beenserviced in eons - find them full of fuel and fly with precision intoa final battle with the Psychlos. So much for believability. Creditthe stylish special effects involving art/set direction to first-timefeature-film director Roger Christian - that's his background. But theheavy-handed Christian uses an unusual ""center wipe"" edit devicebetween every scene, which is distracting and annoying. On the GrangerMovie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Battlefield Earth"" is an awful, grim, tedious2. ""Please, I made a mistake,"" pleads Forest Whitaker, Travolta'shenchman.

To get to""the perfect beach,"" they swim across open sea from one island toanother, crawl through cannabis fields past armed guards, and jumpfrom the top of a 120' waterfall.

""Inthe perfect beach resort, nothing is allowed to interrupt the pursuitof pleasure, not even dying,"" Leo learns.

His style of comedy lives or dies based upon how funny youfind his exaggerated physical humor.       Atkinson became famous in Britain and elsewhere with his""Blackadder"" television series.  American audience may know him best asthe tongue-tied priest in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.       Although his fans may find BEAN well worth their time, others mayfind this 1:30 film about 1:27 too long.  There is probably enoughhumorous material in BEAN for a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, but as afull-length movie it does little more than provide an opportunity toget to know your watch better.  The dull and relatively uglycinematography by Francis Kenny does not help break the film's tedium.       Rowan Atkinson plays a guard named Mr. Bean who works at theNational Gallery of Art in London.  When the board, who views him asthe worst employee they've ever had, is unable to fire him, they pawnhim off as an art expert to the Grierson Gallery in Los Angeles.  TheGrierson Gallery, thanks to a generous donation, has purchased""Whistler's Mother.""  ""Dr."" Bean is supposed to speak at the picture'sunveiling.       Burt Reynolds, in one of his many throw-away roles, plays themuseum's benefactor, General Newton.  ""I don't know the differencebetween a Picasso and a car crash,"" he admits.       The curator of the Grierson Gallery, David Langley (PeterMacNicol), takes the crude Dr. Bean to stay with his family.  After hiswife, Alison (Pamela Reed), meets this guy with spastic lips, bug eyes,and the ability to destroy precious objects in nanoseconds, she leavestown and takes the kids.       Alison is the smartest one in the film and the only one who hadthe good sense to walk out.  Let me give you a flavor of the brand ofhumor which the movie relishes.  We have Bean with a cigarette lighterup his nose one time and tissue stuck up it another.  He bursts a fullbarf bag over one of his fellow plane passengers.  He makes obscenegestures at strangers from his car.  And mainly he makes severalvariations of the classic funny face in which one contorts every facialfeature.       ""Stay here and do nothing,"" advises David as his cure for thedisaster prone Bean.  ""If you do nothing, nothing can go wrong.""  Bean,of course, ignores this advice.  So we get more grunting and grimacing.       At the end, when David is finally able to end his troubles, andmine, by putting Bean on a plane back to Britain, David has one partingthought.  ""You could come back and visit anytime in the fairly distantfuture,"" he says.  I agree -- very distant. ",Bean,PG,1997,2
96,"In many ways Roberto Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"" is a courageousmotion picture. After all, I don't believe anyone in the past hashad the audacity to set a comedy against the backdrop of the veryserious Holocaust, nor would anyone want to. By creating such a light-heartedtone for a film about one of the most cruel and heartbreaking periodsin recent history, it would be easy to offend viewers, especiallythose whom have a personal connection with the Holocaust. Benigni,however, who directed the film and stars in the lead role, somehowsucceeds at such a genre-bending convention (or unconvention, if youthink about it), finding just the right balance between humor anddrama so that the film in no way is condescending to the subject matter. The film begins as the Jewish-Italian Guido, a happy-go-lucky fellow(Benigni), arrives in a postcard-perfect Tuscan village where he staysat his uncle's home and obtains a job as a waiter at a nearby ritzyrestaurant. Almost immediately, Guido runs into, or shall we say ishit by, the beautiful, kind schoolteacher Dora (Nicoletta Braschi)when she accidentally falls from a barn. After a pleasant and rathermystifying meeting, fate seems destined to bring the pair togetherwhen he runs into her a few more times (literally, when he crasheshis bike, and figuratively, at the school where she works). The firsthour of ""Life is Beautiful"" is a winning, sweet, and often funny romanticcomedy, and Benigni constantly reminded me of the old comic greatsBuster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Seven years pass and we discover that Guido and Dora are now marriedand have a young son (Giorgio Cantarini). All is well in their lives,and at the bookstore Guido owns, until anti-semitism slowly beginsto make appearances in the village, first by having store signs putup saying, ""No Jews or Dogs,"" and then by having their own home tornapart. Ultimately, Guido and his son are taken away to a concentrationcamp and are split apart from Dora, who is forced to go with the femaleprisoners. Through the horrors of the Holocaust which are only brieflyshown in a shocking and haunting image of a mountain of dead bodies,Guido keeps his spirits up and tells his son that everything is onlya game, and if they are the first people to reach one one-hundredpoints, they will win the grand prize: a real, life-size tank to ride home on. For its first hour, ""Life is Beautiful"" is a film full of magic, recallingthe days of those '40s and '50s musicals. In its romantic story involvingGuido and Dora, the film contains an undeniable innocence that israrely seen in today's films, and as our protagonist, Guido (effervescentlyplayed by Benigni) is a pure charmer. In its second half, the filmbecomes more tricky, since it was up to Benigni to keep the picture'slight tone while still being realistic about the life of a Jew ina concentration camp. When taking into consideration Steven Spielberg'sbrilliant 1993 Holocaust drama, ""Schindler's List,"" the Holocaustin ""Life is Beautiful"" is like a walk in the park. No on-screen violenceis depicted, although there are hints of the gas chambers that looklike showers, but on the other hand, the film not once actually treatsthe Holocaust as a joke. Instead, the picture attempts to portraya hopeful and spirited man that unfortunately happens to be a Jewin the 1940's and therefore is sent away to what is basically a horrorshow. If the film had actually become heavy on violence and brutalityin this section, then the tone would have been ruined. It is clearlydue to Benigni's artistry in filmmaking that he is easily able tomix these two differing elements so that it is neither too goofy or too sad. ""Life is Beautiful"" honestly only missteps once, but it is in thisflaw that detains the film from being a possible contender as oneof the ten best of 1998. The penultimate sequence took a sudden u-turninto the realms of a sort of fantasy and, without giving it away,I found its last plot development to be entirely unbelievable andabrupt, as if Benigni was trying to rush to a quick conclusion sothat the film would be over. Perhaps if the running time had containedan extra ten minutes, these occurrences would not have been so difficultto swallow. As it remains, the unfortunate ending takes away the possiblegreatness ""Life is Beautiful"" so clearly held, but the film is stillan achievement, particularly because of Benigni, who took an almostimpossible concept and brought it vibrantly to life.",Beautiful,PG-13,2000,1
97,"      From the opening scene in a late night diner, BEAUTIFUL GIRLSappears to be DINER II.  Again we have the banter of a bunch of youngmen in their 20s whose lives revolve around male bonding rituals.  Whenthey meet each other, they grunt like squealing pigs and run at eachother in order to smash shoulders together.  Gosh, what fun we maleshave.       Any movie like BEAUTIFUL GIRLS that frequently uses loud rockmusic to fill in the gaps in the dialog makes me suspicious.  Thesometimes insightful, sometimes ridiculous, but highly uneven script byScott Rosenberg needed all of the help it could get I guess.  Let mesay upfront that this is not a bad movie overall, and there are manycharacters in it I liked a lot and wish I could have seen even more of,but too many were caricatures of people I would be happy never to haveknown.  With better editing (Jeffrey Wolf) and directing (Ted Demme)the movie could have survived the script, but alas it was not to be.       Tommy (Matt Dillon), Kev (Max Perlich), and Paul (MichaelRapaport) are blue collar workers who make extra money during thewinter as snowplow operators.  They are also best buddies with Mo (NoahEmmerich) and Willie (Timothy Hutton).  Surprise, they have troublerelating to people of the opposite sex although, of course, they manageto have little trouble having sex with them.  As Paul puts it, ""They'reall sisters.  It's one big conspiracy.  Trust me.""  In an example ofhow the script is all over the map, in another scene we have a wisePaul advising his friend on choosing a wife, ""One comes to a decisionbased on what one wants, not on what one doesn't want.""  In another heis back again to balderdash with, ""A beautiful girl is all powerful andthat is as good as love gets.""       In hands down the best part of the movie, Willie forms a strongplatonic relationship with a 13 year old girl next door named Martyshort for Martin and played in a wonderful, wise, and witty performanceby Natalie Portman.  Although it may sound like a Lolita role, actuallyit is quite innocent and realistic of the crush that young girls canform.  Here the script is at its best, giving her one funny line afteranother.  Marty is fond of tall tales, and Portman is great atdelivering them.  The best scene of the show is when Willie tells Martytheir relationship will not work.  Very poignant.       Like the guys in the movie, some are interesting and some aren't.Mira Sorvino plays Tommy's girlfriend Sharon.  I liked her role herebetter than the one in MIGHTY APHRODITE that got her an Academy Awardnomination.  She clings to Tommy no matter how much he cheats on herwith his now married ex-girlfriend.  Sharon tells him, ""How can I getto you when the high point of your life was high school?  You were kingof the hill then.""  When her love life with Tommy starts falling apart,she tells her girlfriends, ""Why is it when a relationship doesn't work,we say its because he can't commit?  Don't I bear some of the blamehere?""  A sad, but realistic performance of how some people can becomeobsessed with others when evidence tells them it is a bad idea.       One of the least interesting roles is that of Gina Barrisano(Rosie O'Donnell).  She has to utter one preposterous line afteranother.  A typical one is, ""You guys, as a gender, will have to get agrip, or the future of the human race is looking down.""  At least shemanages to say such gibberish with a straight face.       In a show where some of the twenty year olds have families, butchildren are treated as creatures rarely seen or heard.  It issurprising, therefore, that one of the most touching scenes occurs whena little girl asks her Daddy what is going on.       Beside Sharon and Gina, the other women in the movie include Jan(Martha Plimpton), Darian (Lauren Holly), Andera (Uma Thurman), andTracy (Annabeth Gish).  Gish doesn't appear until the last part and ismainly wasted in the film.  She is a talented actress who does manageto make her little part special.  When her boyfriend Willie wants togive up his poorly paying career as a pianist and become a salesman,she advises him, ""I don't think you should take that job.  Pianoplayers are sexy, salesmen are uncles.""       The worst part of the show is the way it treats alcoholism.Everyone of the buddies has major alcohol problems as do many of thefemales, but in the film they drink like fish and yet it rarely affectstheir actions, speech, or abilities.  The message of the movie seems tobe that young people drink constantly, but somehow this represents noproblem to them or their lives.  The insidious message for all of theteenagers who will see this film is that heavy drinking is natural,everybody does it, it is required for proper bonding, and anyway, thereare no consequences to worry about.  Given the stars, the demographicsof the audience will be heavily tilted toward those most vulnerable toalcoholism.  Scary.       Finally, there are great visuals.  One of my favorites is a hugeSaint Bernard sitting up in a pickup between two of the buddies whileon their snowplowing adventures.  The cinematography (Adam Kimmel) hassome great scenes of a small Northern town in the snow.  The mostbeautiful scene is a time-lapsed sequence of the snow capped town asnight turns to day.  The sets (Dan Davis) are accurate reproductions ofthe claustrophobic clutter of worthless nicknacks from blue collarhomes.       BEAUTIFUL GIRLS runs 1:53.  It has no sex or nudity but a littleviolence.  It is rated R, and whereas I would like to think the MPAA ispunishing the film for its flippant treatment of alcoholism, actually Ithink it is because there are a couple of uses of the F word in a filmmainly of fairly mild language.  I would want to talk to teenagersabout the dangers of drinking if they do see this show.  It is a closecall, but I am not recommending the film.  Some characters were great,namely Willie, Tracy, Marty, and Sharon, but the others made me almostashamed to be a member of the male sex.  I do not blame the actors, butI do hold the screenwriter and the director accountable.  Oh well,there is a lot of potential not quite realized here; maybe next time.Finally, I award the show **. ",Beautiful Girls,R,1996,2
98,"Based on the life of John Forbes Nash Jr., ""A Beautiful Mind"" tellsthe story of an extraordinary man who overcame great obstacles inhis life to become a Nobel Prize-winning mathematician. As directedby Ron Howard (2000's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""), the filmitself is less noteworthy. A frequently disappointing cut-and-pastejob that unevenly spans 47 years, it fails to find any sort of smoothrhythm or dramatic arc. Meanwhile, the characters are placed at adistance from the viewer. From his beginnings at Princeton University in 1947, the somewhateccentric John Nash (Russell Crowe) is an undoubted genius at mathematicsand reason. Just as he has moved on to his career as a half-heartedprofessor and marries the beautiful and patient Alicia (Jennifer Connelly),he is approached by the Pentagon to decode some ominous messages theyhave intercepted from Russia. His work attracts a secret agent bythe name of Mr. Parcher (Ed Harris), who embroils him deeper in thepossibly dangerous dictation of secret messages. To Alicia's uttershock, John is then diagnosed with schizophrenia. Written by Akiva Goldsman (1998's ""Practical Magic"") and adapted fromthe book by Sylvia Nasar, ""A Beautiful Mind"" holds certain similaritieswith the recent ""Vanilla Sky"" in its unpredictable narrative, whichhauntingly intermixes reality and fantasy so well that it often diffusesinto one big nightmare. While ""Vanilla Sky"" is ultimately science-fiction,""A Beautiful Mind"" is very much real in its depiction of a personsuffering from schizophrenia. This arresting approach to the materialis the one aspect that director Ron Howard gets right. Where the film makes a wrong turn is in the clunky editing and spasmodicpacing. Slow-going at first, things pick up as the second hour beginsand John's true colors are brought into focus, only to screech toa halt soon after. Time is also an issue that detracts in the effectivenessof the story. Quickly moving from the 1947 to 1994, so much is leftout of the development and nuances of the characters that they lackany palpable depth or sympathy. If we do not get a firm understanding of who John Nash is and wherehe comes from, at least someone of the acting caliber of Russell Crowe(2000's ""Gladiator"") was gotten to add depth to the underwritten rolehimself. Crowe is a stunning chameleon who takes on every part withsuch vigor and dedication that you cannot help but believe in his performances.  As the increasingly distraught Alicia, Jennifer Connelly (2000's ""Requiemfor a Dream"") is less impressive. A classic beauty who usually shinesin her films, Connelly's turn seems peculiarly ""off"" here. In allfairness, it isn't completely her fault, as the crucial role of Alicianever is given a chance to move beyond the necessities of the plot.  Finally, Ed Harris (2000's ""Pollock""), as the obscure Parcher, ismerely workmanlike, and as the film presses on and more is learnedabout the circumstances of his character, the more one realizes howutterly trivial he is in relation to everything else. Is ""A Beautiful Mind"" a biographical account of John Forbes Nash Jr.,a melodrama, or a thriller? The film's identity crisis shields itfrom ever culminating into a complete whole, despite obvious aspirationson Howard's part to deliver an important, crowd-pleasing movie foradult audiences. At a lengthy 135 minutes, ""A Beautiful Mind"" stillresembles a cliffs notes version of a person's life. John Nash isan amazing human being who has an awe-inspiring life story to tell,but this ""Disease-of-the-Week"" treatment is, unfortunately, not that story.","Beautiful Mind, A",PG-13,2002,3
99," Chaos. It's the name of the baby in the ironically named BEAUTIFULPEOPLE by first-time writer/director Jasmin Dizdar, but CHAOS would havebeen a more appropriate name for this unappetizing mess of a movie.  Not 15 minutes into the film and we've already been introduced to dozensand dozens of characters. It's like going to a cocktail party and beingshown around by a hostess on roller skates. Not just any cocktail party,but a multicultural one in which almost everyone is angry and unhappyand in which racism runs rampant. But thanks to the choppy editing anddizzying handheld camerawork -- is purposely shaking the camera reallynecessary to attempt cinematic pseudo-realism? -- the movie is like anincoherent story told by an inebriated guest.  Get your checklist ready because most of society's ills will make briefguest appearances. From heroin addiction to gang rape, they're allthere. But they fly by with such velocity that you'll have troublepondering anything for long, although you will get the director's pointabout life being hard and grim. He makes lots of other points too. Keepthat checklist handy. Messages zip by like Super Bowl commercials.  One reporter for the BBC suffers from ""Bosnia Syndrome."" This afflictionmeans that he has so identified with the victims of the war that he lieson the train track in order that his leg can be severed too.  The movie plays fast and loose with plausibility in the hopes of gettingsome cheap laughs. After two men pulverize each other on a bus, they aretaken away and put in the same hospital ward, with adjoining beds noless. This means that they can continue their private warfare in thehospital, pulling out each other's tubes and punching each other. Neverare the police called to put a stop to this mayhem.  In perhaps the hardest scene to buy in the movie, an ex-Bosnian soldiermarries into a wealthy British family in which the father is an MP. Atthe lavish wedding, the Bosnian soldier's post-wedding speech has thecrowd aghast as he tells them about his killing women and children. Thefilmmaker would appear to have us believe that it is a cultural thingand that the soldier doesn't realize how inappropriate his speech is.  Dizdar tries without much luck to wrap up his movie in the end by tyingthings together. It's a tedious film that isn't saved by its moralambitions. Like a rambling preacher, Dizdar has a lot on his mind, buthis lack of focus and his inability to create fully developed charactersmeans that his good intentions never amount to anything. Sometimes lessreally is more.  BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE runs 1:47. It is rated R for violence including graphicwar violence, drug usage and language. The film would be acceptable forolder high school students. ",Beautiful People,NR,1999,2

Plus,he'sighs, ""I'd give anything to have that girl in my life,"" it seems likean open invitation to sell his immortal soul to the Devil (ElizabethHurley) in exchange for seven wishes. But the Princess of Darkness hasa great sense of mischief. When he asks to be rich and powerful, hebecomes a Colombian drug lord. When he wants to be a star NBA player,he's more Dennis Rodman than Michael Jordan. He's equally dismayed asa Pulitzer Prize-winning author and as President of the United States(Abraham Lincoln going to the Ford Theater). Versatile BrendanFraser's dexterous physical transformations into these characters areimpressive; as the various incarnations of the woman he desires,Australian actress Frances O'Connor's dialects are on-target; andsophisticated supermodel Elizabeth Hurley embodies a wickedly witty,lusty Lucifer, saucily dressed as titillating male fantasies (nurse,cheerleader, cop, French maid, etc.).

But, beneath theglossy hi-jinks, the screenplay by Larry Gelbart, Harold Ramis & PeterTolan, based on a story by Peter Cook (which was made into a 1967movie with Dudley Moore), is little more than an amusing series ofcomedy sketches. While director Harold Ramis knows how to milk a gag'till it's dry, this is no ""Caddyshack"" or ""Animal House.""

101,"      Director Brian Levant's BEETHOVEN (1992) is one of a host ofchildren's films that specialize in being non-offensive.  Thecharacters are mildly cute, the villains are unbelievable caricatures,and the lovable animals are the best part.  This makes for cinematicfare that the whole family can watch without any risks.  The kids arenot challenged, and the adults may be a bit bored, but as homogenizedalbeit bland escapist entertainment, it delivers.       As the show begins, the lush cinematography by Victor J. Kemperand the nostalgic sets by Alex Tavoularis evoke a warm feelings in theviewers.  Suburbia never looked better.  There are wide and long greenlawns with tall Oaks.  Some of the houses even have classic whitepicketed fences.  In my area these would be multimillion dollar homes,but that is a technicality; it feels middle class.  The bright sunshineof the morning has a happy radiance to it.  At this point the film hasmade visual promises to the viewer that it never fulfills.  Would thatthey had made a real show based on those first few moments.       George Newton (Charles Grodin) is the president of the Newton AutoAir Freshner company.  He has what was once known as a traditionalfamily.  His wife Alice Newton (Bonnie Hunt) no longer works so thatshe can stay home and take care of their three kids, Ryce (NicholleTom), Ted (Christopher Castile), and Emily (Sarah Rose Karr).  Theylooked to be about 14, 10, and 4 in age.       They have many discussions about whether Alice should work or not.George wants her to go back to work to help him at his business, butshe wants to stay at home.  The first time they try a sitter, thelittle girl almost dies thus proving that Alice should stay at home forthe sake of the kids.  All of this little mini-drama notwithstanding,the movie is actually a slapstick comedy.       Some bad people are stealing dogs so they can kill them inhorrible experiments that businesses need done secretly.  A lovable St.Bernard, who will come to be called Beethoven, escapes from the dognappers and comes to the Newton house to live.  George hates the ideaof keeping him, telling the family, ""Listen, we're people people.We're goldfish people.  We're ant farm people.  We're not dog people.""       As soon as Beethoven grows to the typical enormous size of anadult St.  Bernard, trouble begins.  He runs through the mud and waterand runs in the house, basically trashing it.  He seems to always getGeorge the filthiest.  None of this is done with even an attempt atbelievability.  All over the house are large, and clearly fake, animalpaw prints in mud.  Through out the show, the slapstick humor relies onone sight gag after another, like the time Beethoven ties up some badguys' chairs and drags them all over the neighbor.  The dog eats thefood off the table, now that's really original, and he shares an icecream cone with a kid.  I found little of this funny.       Dean Jones wearing extra thick glasses and plays the evil and notcredible veterinarian Doctor Varnick.  Have you ever noticed that if acharacter in a movie has those extra thick glasses, they are alwaysportrayed as evil?  What a stereotype of people with severe sightproblems.  Dean Jones is simply awful in the film.  The material, fromthe script by Edmond Dantes and Amy Holden, that Jones gets likewanting to shoot large dogs to try out bullets that explode on impactis even worst than his acting.       Charles Grodin is an extremely accomplished comedic actor.  To seehim at the top of his form check out BROADCAST NEWS.  In BEETHOVEN, heseems depressed.  His acting is so detached and lifeless that it isclose to an out of body experience.       George's family in the film and Beethoven himself save the picturefrom oblivion.  Too bad the writers did not spend more time oncharacter development.  Each actor is given the outlines of acharacter, but it is never filled in.  Most promising is Nicholle Tom.I hope to see her again.  Finally, the finale is the best part of thepicture and the only one with sufficient energy.  This is the onlypoint in the film, other than the times when ""Rollover Beethoven"" isplayed, that the music (Randy Edelman) comes to life.       BEETHOVEN runs 1:27.  It is rated PG for reason that escape me.There is no sex, nudity, violence, and only one mild cuss word.Perhaps it is because of the discussion of animal killing.  Certainlyyounger kids might be frighten by it, but I think it will all go overtheir heads, so I think the picture would be fine for kids of any age.My son Jeffrey (age 7) liked the picture when he saw it on video forthe first time this week, but I was not impressed.  There is not enoughthere for me to recommend it, and I am giving it * 1/2. ",Beethoven,PG,1992,1.5
102,"      Director Rod Daniel's BEETHOVEN'S 2ND (1993) is the sequel to thebox office hit BEETHOVEN (1992).  Whereas the original stuck to formulalaughs with one slapstick gag after another, the sequel turns itsattention to character development and to the subject of love.Although still not memorable entertainment, it is much better than thefirst.       In BEETHOVEN'S 2ND, the dog Beethoven and all of his caninefriends go looking for the opposite sex.  Even in the Newton household,father George (Charles Grodin), wife Alice Newton (Bonnie Hunt), andtheir three kids, Ryce (Nicholle Tom), Ted (Christopher Castile), andEmily (Sarah Rose Karr) have love on their minds.  Except for Emily,the kids find their first sweethearts and the parents try to help themcope.       First to find true love is Beethoven who hooks up with a St.Bernard named Missy.  She has a large pink bow on her head so that theaudience realizes immediately that she is female.  It seems Missy isowned by humans, Regina (Debi Mazar) and her ex-husband, who are in theprocess of getting a divorce.  Regina tells her ex to pay her $50,000for Missy, whom she actually hates, and screams at him, ""If you wantyour dog back, call my lawyer.""       Beethoven successfully hits it off with Missy, and the result isfour of the sweetest little puppies (Moe, Chubby, Dolly, andTchaikovsky) you have ever seen.  The movie's plot is about the kidstrying to hide the pups from their dad who thinks dogs are a pain andabout Regina, playing the Cruella de Vil role, trying to extort moneyusing Missy.       Ryce enters what appears to be a sweet romance and gets her firstkiss in a touching scene.  Later in the film, we have an uncalled-forsequence about underage drinking and the beginnings of date rape.  Thishas no place in a sweet little nostalgic picture about love andpuppies.       Ted, nicknamed Shorty, is always the last to be picked in baseballand even then they do not want him.  My childhood was just like that sothis struck a chord with me.  Later when a girl he is trying to make animpression on tells him he is too short for her, he reasons to her,""Height is just temporary, right?  When you wake up in the morning,you're a little taller.""  Again, I can remember so well the sinkingfeeling of being rejected for a date.  Did she really already have adate for that night or was she just saying it so that you would goaway?       Even little Emily comes alive in the sequel.  Although at 5 she istoo young for her first romance, she does get to be wiser.  When hermom tells her something is too expensive for them, Emily retorts,""We're not millionaires yet.  Are we thousandaires?""       Bonnie Hunt's part as the mother is better drawn too than thefirst, and Hunt is more animated.  Only Charles Grodin manages to givejust as dismal a performance in the sequel as in the original.  Thisgreat comedic genius sleepwalks through both films.       As in the original, the cinematography (Bill Butler) and the sets(Lawrence Miller) are middle town America at its best.  A dreamy andnostalgic feeling.  There are lots of nice images, my favorites beingone with a pup on George's head and one of a puppy on a skateboard.       My favorite part of the picture is the ending, especially thedream sequence and the ""earthquake"" scene.  I am not giving anythingaway by telling you this, but when you see the show, you will recognizethem based on the above description.       BEETHOVEN'S 2ND runs 1:29.  It is rated PG.  There are twounnecessary minor cuss words and the inappropriate scene of underagedrinking and the start of date rape.  This is no sex, nudity orviolence.  The movie is fine for kids of any age although I do wishthey had deleted the above mentioned scenes.  My son Jeffrey (age 7)liked both BEETHOVENs.

103,"BEETHOVEN'S 4TH, an unoriginal but sometimes funny family film, is, of course,the fourth in the series about a lovable St. Bernard named Beethoven. The plotthis time is a twist on the old story of a look-a-like aristocrat (Michelangelo)and a commoner (Beethoven) getting swapped. Michelangelo is so well manneredthat he not only picks up napkins that humans drop, he also folds them beforeplacing them on the table. The proverbial slob Beethoven, in contrast, is awalking disaster area. Some of the camera angles are from within toilets andtrashcans so we can better witness Beethoven's slovenly behavior. Both caninesare wonderfully lovable.  The supporting human cast delivers acceptable performances, but their purpose isreally to be the backdrop for dog antics.   Michelangelo lives in a mansion befitting his regal demeanor. The daughter,Madison Sedgwick (Kaleigh Krish), has to cope with two AWOL parents. Her dad,Reginald (Matt McCoy), is a techno billionaire who spends his time playing withhis personal digital assistant (PDA), and her mom, Martha (Veanne Cox), is afull-time fur fighter. (Well, she is until she switches to plugging the healthbenefits of toilet water, which causes her to ask Dr. Joyce Brothers whether itmeans that she had ""issues with potty training"" when she was child.)  At Beethoven's house, where most of the action -- read messes and pratfalls --occur, the household is led by ""Mr. Mom,"" Richard Newton (Judge Reinhold), whilehis wife, Beth (Julia Sweeney), goes to the office. Richard, a painter, developsa great idea for greeting cards that people can send to themselves from theirpets. The kids in the Newton household are played nicely by Joe Pichler andMichaela Gallo.  There isn't a single scene in Beethoven to offend anyone. And there isn't amemorable one either.  BEETHOVEN'S 4TH runs 1:34. It is rated G and would be acceptable for all ages.  My son Jeffrey, age 12, found few scenes funny, and, overall, he thought thematerial was only enough for a 30-minute television show. He gave the movie justone star and considered giving it less. ",Beethoven's 4th,G,2001,2
104,"      BEFORE SUNRISE is a romantic talkfest.  It celebrates the joy ofconversation between two people who have just met and who are rapidlybecoming enraptured with each other's conversation and presence.       It is a two character movie featuring Julie Delpy (last seen inWHITE) and Ethan Hawke.  They play two people in their 20s who meet ona European train.  The movie happens almost in real time since it alltakes place in less than 24 hours.  The movie has a realness to it thatapproaches almost a documentary feel.  This is not surprising since itwas written and directed by Richard Linklater whose first movie was theblack and white avant-garde SLACKER.  BEFORE SUNRISE, on the otherhand, is a main stream movie albeit one with a wonderfully freshapproach.       Hawke is an American who speaks only English.  It opens with himlistening to a couple arguing in German on a train from Hungary.  Hewonders what they are talking about.  As one who has traveled on trainswhere I was constantly overhearing conversations in languages I knewlittle of, this was so familiar.  At any rate, he meets a French woman(Delpy) who speaks excellent English and with whom he strikes up afascinating conversation.       They talk about everything as the script is written bright,interesting, and extremely natural.  Many lines were worth remembering.When they are discussing the fighting German couple Delpy says she readthat as people get older men can no longer hear high notes and womenlow notes, and this mean they lose their ability to communicate.  Hawkesays that they are sort of canceling each other out and maybe naturedid this as a way to keep older married couples from killing eachother.       Hawke convinces Delpy to get off the train in Vienna with him andspend the day and night with him wandering the city until his planeleaves the next morning.  The scene of him asking her to go with him isprecious.  His logic is beautiful and his body language perfect.  Icould see this scene again and again.  The train part is the first 10minutes of the movie, and the rest is their adventure in Vienna.       If you love trains and Vienna, as I do, this movie will be aspecial treat for you.  You get to see the Prater amusement park, theOpera House, Demels coffee house, and many other landmarks, but themovie is no travelogue; it is about conversations and romance.  Notice,I said romance as in infatuation and kissing.  Whether anything moretranspires between them, you will have to see the show.  The sceneswhere they discuss how far to take their friendship that evening arenatural, honest, and a lot of fun to eavesdrop on.  Through out theshow, I laughed out loud many times at the sort of natural things thatcan happen in romantic conversation.       What would I change about the show?  Almost nothing.  I do think Iwould have him lose that goatee.  It was too 50s beatnik looking.       The acting was terrific.  It was easy to identify with thecharacters, and you certainly cared a lot about both of them.  Youreally wonder when you leave the show what are they doing now and thenyou pinch yourself and remember that it was fiction.  The largestamount of credit has to go to the writer/director who was confidentenough of his script and cast to let the two leads just talk constantlyfor the entire movie. ",Before Sunrise,R,1995,3.5
105,"1995's ""Before Sunrise"" is just about as perfect and complete as amotion picture can be, a 100-minute conversation between two strangerswho meet on a train and gradually fall deeply in love with each otherover a single night in Vienna, only to have to part ways in the morning.The dialogue was natural and always fascinating, the characters weremeticulously and lovingly developed, and actors Ethan Hawke and JulieDelpy's fiery chemistry approached an almost ethereal beauty. As thefilm ended, they vowed to meet in exactly six months at the same trainstation, kissed and hugged passionately, and physically walked out of each other's lives. ""Before Sunset"" is an unlikely sequel in that the original movie wasa modest indie that only grossed $5.5 million at the box-office, onlyto garner a fervent cult following on video. Because of this, thedesire to return to these characters was not based on financial reasons,but because Hawke, Delpy, and director Richard Linklater (2003's ""Schoolof Rock"") held a personal stake in wanting to know what happened tothese two characters. The majority of casual moviegoers have probablynever seen ""Before Sunrise,"" a shame because what they have missedis one of the most enchantingly romantic films ever made. Seeing the original and having it fresh in one's mind when they walkinto ""Before Sunset"" is a remarkable asset, only standing to givethis continuing chapter more meaning and emotional gravitas. Few cinematicromances could ever hope to equal the faultlessness of ""Before Sunrise,""and ""Before Sunset"" is no exception, but that is the latter picture'sonly debit. This is a spectacularly successful sequel, pure, impassionedand requisitely a little more downbeat. It is also a much-needed alternativeto the big, flashy, special effects-laden popcorn movies of the summer,and one of the season's must-see efforts. Nine years have passed since Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (JulieDelpy) went in their separate directions, Jesse back to America andCeline to Paris, but constant nagging thoughts about each other haveplagued them through a series of problematic relationships and lifeexperiences. When Jesse makes his way to a Paris bookstore„his laststop on a tour with his first novel, based on that fateful night„heis taken aback by the appearance of Celine, who is all to familiarwith the source of his writings. Jesse only has an hour before hemust leave to catch his plane back to America, and he and Celine decideto take advantage of their chance encounter by catching up with eachother. Did either, for example, show up at that train station as theyplanned six months following their first meeting? As they walk aroundthe city and talk, it becomes exceedingly apparent that Jesse, whois unhappily married and has a son, and Celine, who is in an unstablerelationship, still hold irrefutably strong feelings for each other.As the time approaches for them to once again part, the question becomeswhether these two, who are clearly destined for each other but havenine years worth of baggage between them (significant others, children,careers, and the whole country difference), could ever realistically be together. Picking up in the lives of these two vivid, scrupulously defined individualsafter nearly a decade turns out to be almost as effortless as breathing.The dialogue, written by director Richard Linklater and his lead actors,is imperative to the success of ""Before Sunset""; without it, the filmwould run the risk of becoming dull very quickly, and without a naturalflow, the premise would lose credibility. Fortunately, the writingis of the highest and most realistic order, capturing the ebb andflow and tics and gestures of two people holding an actual conversation.While Jesse and Celine had roughly twelve hours to spend togetherin the first film, this time they only have one, and so there is littletime for frivolity. As two people with an undeniable bond would dohad they not seen each other for nine years, Jesse and Celine havereal questions to ask the other, and hold a genuine care in their answers. The talk, if one clearly remembers ""Before Sunrise,"" additionallyholds deeper meaning here, unveiling how both characters have changedover the years, whether they would like to admit it or not. Celine,especially, has unknowingly been stripped of much of her bright idealismand outlook for the future. As they discuss this very topic, and Jesseasks Celine soon after if she believes in reincarnation (a questionhe also asked her in the first movie), the marked difference in heranswer makes for one of the most heartbreaking cinematic moments ofthe year. And as for Jesse, the viewer mourns how he has essentiallyturned into his own father, staying in a loveless marriage solelyfor the benefit of his child. Ethan Hawke (2004's ""Taking Lives"") and Julie Delpy (2001's ""WakingLife"") fall effortlessly back into their roles of Jesse and Celineas if they never stopped playing these parts. They are one of thegreat romantic pair-ups in modern film, and with even the most subtleof actions and body language create remarkable depth of characterand emotional power. When Celine sings a song to Jesse that she wrote,and afterward denies having written it about him, the way in whichshe responds is all the proof the viewer needs that she isn't beinghonest. Hawke and Delpy deserve major end-of-the-year awards accoladesfor what is an extension of both's most unblemished performances, to date. The final scene of ""Before Sunset,"" which manages to be even moreopen-ended than its predecessor's finale, is a tricky balancing actof music, acting, and motion that speaks far louder than any wordsever could. As lovely as the final image is before the fade-out, however,it comes as a somewhat abrupt respite to the more deliberate and lyricalending of the original. If ""Before Sunrise"" was a formative masterpiece,then ""Before Sunset"" is a lesser, but just as exquisitely gratifying,gem. All of the studio-produced, mass-marketed romances out there,take note: this is precisely what a love story should be. ",Before Sunset,R,2004,3
106,"If there's an award for the boldest, most unconventional andwildly inventive movie of the year, it has to go to ""Being JohnMalkovich,"" in which screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director SpikeJonze blend surrealism with science-fiction and self-parody. JohnCusack stars as an out-of-work puppeteer who takes a job as a filingclerk in a New York office building on the 7 1/2 floor, where therents are low because the ceilings are half the normal height. It's agreat visual gag as workers hunch over, scuttling down the hall. Stuckin an unhappy marriage to an almost unrecognizable Cameron Diaz withdark, frizzy hair, he becomes infatuated with a co-worker, CatherineKeener, who couldn't be less interested. At least until he discovers asmall door behind a filing cabinet that leads to a tunnel which,inexplicably, sucks him into the brain of actor John Malkovich. Cusackcan see through the actor's eyes and share whatever he's is feeling -for 15 minutes - until he's dumped into a ditch on the New JerseyTurnpike. When he shares his discovery with Keener, she immediatelysees the potential in selling entrance - $200 per person - to thisportal so that others can partake in the sensory and emotionalexperiences of John Malkovich. They become partners in this commercialventure - until, inevitably, the enigmatic Malkovich discovers howthey've opened this ""metaphysical can of worms."" Plus, there's adeliriously mad subplot of gender/blender sexual seduction, absurdistsupporting gems from Orson Bean and Mary Kay Place, plus witty cameosby Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, and Brad Pitt. On the Granger Movie Gaugeof 1 to 10, ""Being John Malkovich"" is a clever, outrageous 10. It's afilm of astonishing and beguiling originality. ",Being John Malkovich,R,1999,3.5
107,"There's an old expression: put ten Jews in a room to discussanything controversial and you get eleven opinions.  In Israeltoday, for example, citizens hold political views from left toright ranging from giving up the West Bank, Gaza and EastJerusalem to taking over the Palestinian areas and expelling theArab population.  There are about a dozen political partiesrepresented in the parliament.  But one opinion you won't findamong Jews anywhere in the world is that the Nazis are goodguys.  Nonetheless even among the purportedly rational peoplein Henry Bean's pulsating drama, ""The Believer,"" one elderlyman's opinion veers closely toward that view.  A Holocaustsurviver, now in his late eighties, holds forth that six million Jewswere killed in the camps because the Jews had turned awayfrom the Torah: that God himself created Hitler to punish theJews.     But that Holocaust survivor has nothing on the principalcharacter in the film, Danny Baling (Ryan Goslin from ""Murderby Numbers""), a brilliant product of the yeshivas who has aseverely conflicted feeling about his own people.  He's a NewYork skinhead who preaches anti-Semitic hate while at thesame time he wears the tallis and is fluent in Hebrew.  In thestory's very opening, he fixes his gaze  on a young Orthodoxstudent (Peter Meadows) riding the subway and reading intently,steps on the guy's shoes, follows him into the streets and beatsthe stuffing out of him calling him a ""yeshiva bucher.""  Howcould this be? That's only the beginning.  In scene after visceralscene in a film that never lets up, director Bean in this winner ofthe 2001 Sundance film Festival Grand Jury Prize wants us towonder how Danny got his perverted, self-hating views, offeringonly smidgens of evidence linking him to his corruptedphilosophy.  Never mind that he has a passive father and nomother in the household.  Millions of people face that condition. Far more important is that Danny at the age of twelve engagesin an intense argument with his teacher in a discussion of thefirst book of the Bible.  While the instructor probably believesthat Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his own son, Isaac,proves that it is only right that human beings subordinate theirwills to that of the creator, Danny holds that this proves that Godis everything, the big cohuna, and human beings are nothing butweaklings.  From that point, Danny develops an animositytoward the Jewish people, and is determined to fight backagainst this perceived weakness by hanging out with skinheads,plotting the destruction of synagogues and the killing ofinfluential Jews.     Though Mr. Bean is known for scripting slick commercialthrillers like ""Internal Affairs"" and ""Enemy of the States,"" hecomes up with a provocative story which is based, I think, on anactual case of one Daniel Burros, a Jewish Nazi during the1960's.  With Jim Denault's hand-held camera zooming in on agroup of fascists who plan to use Danny to raise funds andmake a showing (like France's Le Pen?) In the legitimatepolitical arena, ""The Believer"" fixates almost obsessively onRyan Gosling in the title role as he carries out an affair with ayoung woman, Carla (Summer Phoenix), who is the daughter ofextreme right-wing woman Lina Moebius (Theresa Russell) butis more excited by Danny's passions than by her mother'spolitics and is determined to learn Hebrew, light candles on theSabbath, and attend services in a synagogue.  As the mostlymoronic members of the skinhead group gradually wonderwhether Danny is himself a Jew, Danny's very life is threatened.     ""The Believer"" can leave the viewer confused about Danny'sstrange views, thinking about the roots of the abnormalphilosophy, but that's all to the good.  Tony Kaye's ""AmericanHistory X"" is also hard-hitting, dealing with a young man who isseduced into a white supremacy movement on the West Coast,but Kaye's story has the all-too-pat ending so common amongblockbuster releases from Hollywood.  ""The Believer"" could becalled, then, the thinking person's ""American History X,"" anintense, honest, drama that compels attention, stirs theemotions and stimulates thought. ","Believer, The",R,2001,3.5
108,"Monday, January 13, 2003 Posted: 5:08 PM EST (2208 GMT)TEHRAN, Iran (Reuters) -- Iranian women have begun to penetratethe once all-male preserve of soccer stadiums, in a trend thatauthorities hope will improve the behavior of the Islamic Republic'sfanatical male supporters.     Yep.  The mellowing mullahs of modern Mesopotamia haveachieved democracy at last.  What's next?  Women as players onthe field?  Iran is not ready for that - imagine how bare-leggedcoeds on the field would influence the behavior of men in thestands and on the playing grounds.  Western nations, of course,are way past that with high schools and colleges encouragingeither coed sports or at the very least some all-girls' teams.  Justthink, though about the resistance that would be put up bytraditional parents, moms and dads who worry that their darlingsmight grow muscles, and who'd want to marry them then? Gurinder Chadha's ""Bend It Like Beckham"" takes on that verytheme in a rollicking movie with an exuberance that one of myBritish friends tells me is fairly rare in comedies produced on thespecter'd isle.  If ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" can stun theexperts by leading the box office for several weeks in what musthave been considered a fringe indie, then why not ""Beckham"" -which is better acted, funnier, and has something to say aboutrace and gender relations today?     The movie, which is co-written by director Chadha and PaulMayeda Berges, takes us to two communities in West London andSouthall, one inhabited by a boisterous population of ethnicIndians, at least one of whom had emigrated from Kenya, and onehousing a family of blondes who are traditional in their own way. Jess Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra), a high-school senior whoworships a professional soccer player named Beckham asevidenced by a large picture in her room, is about to enter anEnglish college and is encouraged by her dad (Anupam Kher) andMom (Shaheen Khan) to emulate her soon-to-be-married oldersister Pinky (Archie Panjabi).  Instead the parents are appalled thatshe has taken up an invitation from a white classmate, Jules (KeiraKnightley) to try out for an all-girls' soccer team coached by Joe(Rhys Meyers).  Fireworks begin when Jess's folks find out abouther athletic sojourns, forcing Jess to sneak out of the house fromtime to time to join the team.  Complications develop when thecoach displays more amorous attention to Jeff than to Jules, thewoman who has the hots for him. and when the date chosen forJess's sister wedding is the very day that Jess is scheduled to playin the most important match of the season.     ""Bend It Like Beckham"" breaks no new ground - after all, hasthere even been a year that filmmakers have eschewed productionsabout inter-cultural rivalries and generational gaps?  But this one isexceptional for the genre.  No mindless, Adam Sandler-like""Waterboy"" which reaches for the audience gut by finding a clownthat everyone picks on but who shows 'em all up by the end,""Beckham"" sneaks its theme easily and entertainly into the story,on the side of the angels in urging parents to avoid pushing theirconventional expectations onto children who have been born into adifferent cultural world.  Mr. Bhamra regrets that he gave in tosocial demands when the British subjects in Kenya laughed at hisregular use of a turban and refused to allow him to enter into theircompetitions.  Rather than use his resentment to fight for hisdaughter, he has unconsciously passed on his disillusionment inmuch the way that an abused child will pass on the brutality hehas received to his own children.     Both the white English mom (Juliet Stevenson) and the Indianmother are fit subjects for Chadha's satiric eye, the former for hergeneral ditziness and her conviction that soccer playing has turnedher daughter, Jules, into a lesbian; and the latter for overlyprotecting her little girl, trying to fit her into the dull conformity ofcooking chapatis and masalas coupled with marriage to atraditional Indian boy.       The swiftly-paced film is all in the greatest of fun, with youngParminder K. Nagra and her love interest, played by JonathanRhys-Meyers, turning on the chemistry in buoyant performances. Craig Pruess's lively soundtrack bounces up the mood even furtherwhile Jong Lin's lensing, aided mightily by Justin Krish's editing,keeps the soccer plays exciting. ",Bend It Like Bekham,PG-13,2003,3

I know those who show off their purebreds take them very,very seriously, but for onlookers, like Christopher Guest, thepossibilities for comedy are endless. In fact, sanity goes to the dogswhere Best of Breed trophies are concerned. This wacky mockumentary, aworthy successor to ""Waiting for Guffman,"" centers on Philadelphia'sannual Mayflower Dog Show, similar to New York's Westminster Dog Show.Diverse contenders include, from Illinois, a bickering, neuroticyuppie couple (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock) with Beatrice, theirdepressed Weimaraner; from Florida, a milquetoast menswear salesman(Eugene Levy) with, literally, two left feet and bubbly, hispromiscuous wife (Catherine O'Hara), showing Winky, their NorwichTerrier; from North Carolina, a fly-fishing shop owner (ChristopherGuest) with his beloved Bloodhound Hubert; from New York, aflamboyantly gay couple (John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean) withMiss Agnes, one of their Shih Tzus; and from the Main Line, a trashytrophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) and her hired handler (Jane Lynch)with their two-time champion Standard Poodle, Rhapsody in White.

110,"As people grow older they tend to see their younger daysthrough the rosy glasses of nostalgia. So, now 1980s arebecoming the next golden age, and, consequently, Hollywoodfilms made in that ""golden era"" are becoming fashionableagain. This probably wouldn't please majority of filmcritics who see 1980s as the darkest period of American filmhistory when general low quality of movies used to be insharp contrast to high artistic standards of the previousdecade. Decline of the quality was often blamed to the bigstudios and producers who found new ways to make their filmsprofitable, mainly by concentrating more of their efforts onadvertising and less on the quality of actual films. Theresult was the situation we have till this day - overhyped""event"" films that make good results on the box-office onlyto perish from people's memory after a year or two. However,some of 1980s films that represent such blockbusterphilosophy in its essence are actually quite good. One ofthem is BEVERLY HILLS COP, 1984 action comedy directed byMartin Brest and often mentioned as the best 1980s filmfeaturing Eddie Murphy.  In this film Murphy plays Axel Foley, undercover Detroitpoliceman whose tendency to ignore police procedure oftencauses rows with his superior, Inspector Todd (played byGilbert R. Hill). Another such row would develop when Axel'schildhood friend Mikey Tandino (played by James Russo) getskilled by professional assassins. Axel is determined toinvestigate the murder, but his boss wouldn't let him, so hetakes vacation and decides to find the killers on his own.Trail leads him to Beverly Hills, where Mikey used to workas security guard in art gallery run by elegant but sinisterart dealer Victor Maitland (played by Stephen Berkoff). Axelsuspects that Maitland deals in something other than art,but local police is not only sceptical but also disapprovesAxel's unorthodox methods of investigation. LieutenantBogomil (played by Ronny Cox), in order to keep Foley incheck, assigns two of his detectives - Detective BillyRosewood (played by Judge Rheinhold) and Sergeant Taggart(played by John Ashton) - to monitor his every move.Streetwise Axel, of course, won't allow that those twodistract him from his true mission.  BEVERLY HILLS COP was produced by Don Simpson and JerryBruckheimmer and, naturally, has all the their trademarks.The plot is simplistic and rather predictable, charactersare mostly cartoons, but all this is compensated withspectacular car chases, shootouts and general mayhemtogether with the loud soundtrack (almost all the songs, aswell as the title theme by Harold Faltermeyer, turned out tobe very popular hits of 1980s). But the secret of BEVERLYHILLS COP success is one man - Eddie Murphy. In thebeginning, this film was supposed to be quite serious policethriller, but Murphy single-handedly turned into comedy byenabling his loudmouth, streetwise character to deliverlaughs in almost every scene. Because of that, role of AxelFoley is now considered one of the best in Murphy's career.The rest of the cast was also good, especially many bitplayers like Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans,who would start building their own successful careers in theyears to come. Direction of Martin Brest, on the other hand,is the least noticeable element of the film and this isprobably one of the film's advantages - plot developsneatly, without overdistracting MTV-style scenes that usedto plague its sequel.  Additional reason why we should pay attention BEVERLY HILLSCOP is because this film illustrates some of the generalsensibilities of 1980s America. A lot of humour is based onthe sharp contrast between eroding industrial heartland ofAmerica, represented in impoverished, blue-collar America,and booming, rich and sophisticated Beverly Hills whoseyuppie inhabitants, law enforcement included, lost any touchwith ""real"" world and old American values. As a result,foreigners penetrate and subvert America from within -either as Japanese businessmen who buy American companiesor, in the case of this movie, European gangsters who undercover of expensive clothes poison American children. Britishactor Stephen Berkoff thus plays a distinctively Englishvillain - a cliche that would become almost obligatory in1990s Hollywood. Ironically, the movie franchise latersuffered because of American chauvinism - Eddie Murphyreportedly turned down proposed sequels with plots happeningin various cities across of the world, which was ratherunfortunate decision, judging by two less than stellarsequels with plots situated in Beverly Hills.  One of the most amusing aspects of its film is the way ittreats homosexuality before ""political correctness"" becameHollywood's latest dogma. Some of today's oversensitiveaudience might get offended by implicit gay bashing inscenes when Murphy's characters meets or impersonates gaycharacters, usually portrayed as quasi-feminine caricatures.Then again, those viewers who follow Tarantino's example andstart seeking hidden homosexual subcontext might find plentyof scenes of male characters bonding and expressing love foreach other. ",Beverly Hills Cop,R,1984,3
111," These days the lack of originality in Hollywood reflectsitself in the deluge of remakes. But, only a few years ago,before Wes Craven publicly made fun of the practice, sequelshad been more popular among Hollywood producers. Sequelsalso used to be popular among directors and movie starswhose careers went south. The way to regain popularity andprestige, they thought, was the use the same formulas,characters and story lines that brought them success in thefirst place. One of such celebrity was Eddie Murphy, blackcomedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during thefirst part of this decade. In order to return to thespotlight, he chose to resurrect the franchise created byhis most popular film, BEVERLY HILLS COP, 1984 action comedythat had already spawned the sequel in 1987. Seven yearslater, for the third instalment, he used the directorialservice of John Landis, another fading star, with whom hesuccessfully collaborated twice - in TRADING PLACES andCOMING TO AMERICA. This time, however, third time wasn't thecharm and BEVERLY HILLS III was failure. Eddie Murphy had towait few more years for real comeback.  Eddie Murphy here plays Axel Foley, fast-talking streetwiseDetroit policeman, who raids illegal chop shop. The routinepolice action ends in tragedy, when the criminals killFoley's boss. Determined to bring the killers to justice,Foley realises that their leader is Ellis De Wald (TimothyCarhart). When it turns out that De Wald happens to besecurity chief for Wonderland theme park in Los Angeles,Foley goes back to Los Angeles. There, with the help of hisold friend, local policeman Rosewood (Judge Rheinhold),Foley would clash with money counterfeit ring.  Ten years has passed since the original and times aredefinitely different. In this decade, the contrast betweenblue collar Detroit and yuppie Beverly Hills, which provideda lot of gags in 1984 film, simply doesn't work.Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza provides another conflict,this time between the childish sillyness of the Good Guysand business-like professionalism of the Bad Guys. SinceFoley belongs to the former, his character had to watch hislanguage, and the tone of the film in general is moreinfantile. Unfortunately, this film still belongs to actionmovie genre, and there is too much violence for littlechildren. Nice example is the humorous scene in thebeginning, which turns into standard Ramboesque bloodbath.Unlike Donner with the LETHAL WEAPON series, Landis simplycan't balance the comedy with ""regular"" action, and theresult is a film that fails in both aspects. Action scenesare sometimes interesting, but not too spectacular (at theend, scenery of Wonderland is more fascinating than theaction itself); humour, on the other hand, falls flat. Tomake even worse, some minor characters from 1984 film getsunnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure(especially art expert turned into arms dealer, played byBronson Pinchot). In the end, although the film providedsome entertainment, viewers, at least critical ones, wouldprobably be happy to know that there aren't any plans forBEVERLY HILLS IV. ",Beverly Hills Cop III,R,1994,1

113,"TV has been around for only three generations and movies forfive. That leaves tens of thousands of generations thatdepended on story-telling for passing on the myths of thevarious cultures and to enable fathers and sons, sometimesmothers and daughters to bond.  The little one would stay in bedand beg daddy to read from the good books, or even better torelate tales of daddy's own childhood, which is all to the good. While there is still some of this ancient entertainment goingaround for example I regularly see moms and little girls andboys in the Barnes and Noble children's room showing their totsthe pictures and reading the wonderful classics like ""The Wizardof Oz"" I can't help looking with regret at how the story-tellers ontelevision, kids glued to the tube sometimes on the sets in theirown rooms are actually causing more alienation between thegenerations.     In ""Big Fish,"" the contemporary parents and a recently-marriedyoung man presumably have TV's in their homes.  What'ssignificant, though, is that the tales, often taller than they aretruthful, are still being related and passed down from one manto many others in the greater family.  The ironic difference isthat the elderly father's palaver has been creating a schismrather than a bond, the young man so filled with his dad'slargely false anecdotes about the latter's youth that he neverreally got to know the old man.  As Edward Bloom (the old manplayed by Albert Finney) tells his young 'un, William Bloom (BillyCrudup), their relationship is like an iceberg.  Ninety percent isunderwater and unable to be seen and accessed, only tenpercent is visible.  Old Ed is given to stories that his son hasheard over and over, particularly one about the giant catfish thatate Ed's wedding band and required him to snatch the fish in hishands and shake the ring from its mouth.       As the twenty-something William, now married to someone hemet in Paris while working for a global press outfit, getsincreasingly frustrated, Edward, now dying of cancer andremaining in bed throughout the film banters on and on, eachstory different from the others, but all the characters destined tomeet at the conclusion whether metaphorically or physically isunimportant.     Edward's stories may remind you of Walter Mitty fantasiesgiven a surreal treatment in Norman Z. McLeod's 1947 comedyabout a milquetoast who imagines greatness, but even moreabout Robert Zemeckis's 1994 film ""Forrest Gump,"" about amentally challenged fellow who, without realizing much, is putinto a variety of backdrops and real-life events.  Yet EdwardBloom is neither milquetoast nor brain-damaged: simply a manwho has always told tales with great charm while paradoxicallykeeping his son at arm's length, never revealing the realEdward Bloom but only the hyperbolic one.     Director Tim Burton, who splashes the big screen with surrealimages, is in his element.  The regisseur of such imaginativemovies as ""Sleepy Hollow"" (about a bumbling constable whotries to use scientific methods to figure out a series ofbeheadings) and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (a PumpkinKing tires of the old routine in Halloween Town and falls in lovewith Christmas) displays the likes of ol' Edward, recast in thestories decades earlier in a role played by Ewan McGregor asthe ultimate Mr. Clean.  In his youth, we're to believe that heindentured himself to a circus impresario (Danny De Vito) inreturn for the boss' willingness to reveal one new fact about thewoman of Edward's dreams, Sandy Bloom (Alison Lohman), sothat in due time Edward would get to propose to the woman hehad never spoken to.  Few movies about love at first sight areso elaborately constructed as this one, which allows Edward tocall florists across a wide area to send daffodils, Sandy'sfavorite flower,  to the grounds of Sandy's college dorm.      The inventiveness of this Edward knows few bounds.  He evenparachuted into Korea during the war 1950-53, defeated twoNorth Korean guards in the dark, and ran away to America withtwin singers.  The story of the huge catfish that ate Edward'sgolden wedding band only to spit it out after being violentlyjostled by the fisherman may have been inspired by the biblicalstory of Jonah and the Whale.  All of this is by way of Burton'sconveying, via John August's adaptation of Daniel Wallace'sbook, ""Big Fish, A Novel of Mythic Proportions,"" that stories fromthe Bible, the Koran, presumably the Bhagavad Gita and TheBook of Zoroaster, are myths somehow essential to pass downthrough the generations to bind each to the others.       ""Big Fish,"" whose ensemble includes Steve Buscemi as theleading poet of a small Alabama town who turns bank robber(filmed near Montgomery in Wetumpka); Jessica Lange asSandy, the wife of the dying man who was allegedly courted inan all-out campaign decades earlier; Helena Bonham Carter asthe grown woman whom young Edward knew when she was alittle girl in a town that proved to be too small for his dreams;and Billy Crudup as the guy wanting to know more about hisdad before the latter would son die but who realizes that thestories he heard, however embellished, really do identify theman whose dreams were too small to fit in a sleepy, CentralAlabama ville.  ""Big Fish"" is a lovely tale, heightened by asurrealism in short supply in the movie theaters this summer, anode to the inevitable bond existing not only between people ofdiverse interests but between folks of different generations asfar back as we can imagine. ",Big Fish,PG-13,2004,3
114,"    If you're a die-hard Martin Lawrence fan, you'll appreciatethis movie. If not, forget it. Lawrence plays FBI agent MalcolmTurner, who has built a reputation as a master of disguises. When he'ssent to a small town in Georgia to capture a bank robber who's escapedfrom prison, he sets up a stakeout near the home of the con'sgirl-friend's long-lost grandmother (Ella Mitchell), an old womanknown as Big Momma. Only Big Momma's not around. So Turner decides togo deep undercover and impersonate the hefty Southern matriarch,including cooking soul food, singing gospel, even deliveringbabies. The result is an outrageous romantic farce because,predictably, Turner experiences an emotional transformation, falls forthe girl-friend, a single mother played by lovely Nia Long (""BoilerRoom""), befriends her son and struts on the basketball court: ""Grandmaknows she's got game!"" Of course, when the real Big Momma surfaces, astunned onlooker chirps, ""Are you the Doublemint twins?"" Thescreenplay by Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer, based on a story byQuarles, serves primarily as a vehicle for Martin Lawrence's riff onEddie Murphy's ""Nutty Professor"" concept of playing several differentcharacters. And if it looks derivative, perhaps it's because directorRaja Gosnell served as editor on ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" while Big Momma'smake-up and prosthetics are the work of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" Oscar-winner,Greg Cannom. Cannom's also responsible for transforming Lawrence intoan Asian man for the opening sequence in which Turner busts an illegaldog fighting ring. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Big Momma'sHouse"" is a sporadically funny 5 - and, yes, the fat lady sings! ",Big Momma's House,PG-13,2000,1.5
115,"      BIG NIGHT is a charming little gem.  It isn't about much ofanything, and yet the emotions are more genuinely expressed that many amore pretension endeavor.  This is not a particular important picture,and it will certainly not be much of a money maker, but it is full ofheart and some nice pieces of acting.       Except for a little before and after, BIG NIGHT happens over asingle day and night.  In New York in the mid-1950s two brothers, Primo(Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci), are new immigrants fromItaly.  They own a soon to be totally bankrupt Italian restaurantcalled Paradise.  Primo is a great chef, but he only wants to makeauthentic Italian food like risotto whether the customers like it ornot.  Primo's philosophy is, ""to eat good food is to be close to God.""       In the opening scene a woman tries to get a side order ofspaghetti and meatballs since she hates the risotto she has ordered.Primo refuses since he would never put meatballs in spaghetti and wouldcertainly not serve the woman a second starch dish.  Secondo runs therestaurant and pleads with him to give their only customer what shewants since the restaurant is going broke afterall.       Across the street is an Italian place owned by their friend Pascal(Ian Holm).  He serves his customers spaghetti with lots of meatballsand has ostentatious flaming dishes for show.  Helping him is hisbeautiful wife Gabriella (Isabella Rossellini) who is having an affairwith Secondo.  Secondo is dating Jill (Minnie Driver) who is a tellerat the local bank.  Secondo refuses to have sex with her until he ismore financially secure.  Since her bank is calling in his loan, thefuture looks bleak.       Pascal advises Secondo, ""give people what they want, then lateryou can give them what you want,"" but Secondo can not get Primo tochange the menu even a little.  Pascal sees life much simpler.  As heexplains, ""I am a businessman.  I am anything I need to be at anytime.""       Pascal manages to give Primo and Secondo a last chance.  He sayshe can get Louie Prima, the famous jazz musician, and all of his bandto have dinner at the Paradise Restaurant.  With the subsequentpublicity, people will flock there.  Almost all of the movie is aboutthe preparations for and serving of the food on the BIG NIGHT.       In its lush and colorful food photography and in the reverence itgives to food, it is reminiscent of that great film, LIKE WATER FORCHOCOLATE.  The cinematography is intimate and the sets, especially ofthe wood paneled restaurant, are extremely authentic.  Paradise is achurch for food, and the actors become the holy choir.  The people whodesigned the food for the film deserve extra credit.  You may want togo to a great Italian restaurant after seeing the picture, but don't.You would be disappointed.  This food is heaven - you would only getfood for mere mortals.       The acting by Tucci is excellent, but Shalhoub steals the show.Think of Primo as the Gandhi of chefs.  I kept expecting a scene withhim lighting incense sticks to the food and praying to it.  I likeHolm, but had trouble hearing him speak with an Italian accent.Driver, from CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and the Masterpiece Theater TV show ""ThePolitician's Wife,"" is a great actress, but her role here is secondarydoes not allow her to show off her talents.  Only Rossellini ismiscast.  Her performance seems out of another movie.  Finally, in acomedic part Campbell Scott is good as a Cadillac dealer.  As those ofyou not alive during the 50s may not be fully aware, to own a newCadillac then was proof positive of your success in life.       The direction and the script is ready to take things slow andnatural.  Many scenes have little dialog and in fact there is areasonably long epilogue with no words at all just food preparation andconsumption.  All of this notwithstanding, the films is never boringnor the pace too slow.  There are tragedies, mainly small, along theway, and the actors, particularly Shalhoub, with few words and greatfacial expressions manage to move the audience.       BIG NIGHT runs about an hour and three quarters.  It is rated R,but is one of the softest R I can ever remember.  There is no sex,nudity, or violence.  This is a gentle film, but there are just a fewbad words and one them happens to be the F word hence the rating.Although 99 per cent of the film is in English, the F word appears inthe Italian part with the English subtitles.  Except for that one word,the movie would be PG.  I think the film would be fine for any kid whois interested in it.  I recommend the picture to you and give it ***. ",Big Night,R,1996,3
116,"  Rose are red. Violets are blue. You scammin' me? Or am I scammin' you?        THE BIG SQUEEZE is a whimsical fable.  As soon as the openingcredits of unaligned type appears with their multicolor shades ofpastel, the audience is served notice that a light hearted comedy isapproaching.  As the quote above from the press kit shows, writer anddirector Marcus DeLeon wants to weave a web where you are never quitesure who is on the up and up, and who isn't.  If you are tired of bigmessage films and epics and want to kick back and just be entertainedwith a simple little film, THE BIG SQUEEZE is just the flick for you.       As the action starts, con man Benny O'Malley (Peter Dobson) iskicked out of a boxcar because his hand inconveniently has not justfour kings, but five.  Down but never out, he heads into a local barbroke, but looking for action.  He tries his come on lines to bartenderTanya Mulhill (Lara Flynn Boyle from THREESOME and RED ROCK WEST), butsince she is married, they don't go far.  He later switches hisapproach to the other bartender, Cece (Teresa Dispina), who hits it offwith him.       Tanya is married to minor league ex-baseball player Henry (LucaBercovici from PACIFIC HEIGHTS).  Henry got hurt in a car accident acouple of years ago and has never worked again.  He spends his days atthe mission run by Father Sanchez (Sam Vlahos), and when he isn't therehe reads constantly from his well worn Bible.       One day, Tanya opens Henry's mail and is aghast to find that Henryhas been keeping his insurance settlement of $136,000 from her all ofthis time.  His righteous stance is that, ""Money is the devil's callingcard.  He is not welcome in this house.""  She wants to divorce Henryand get her half of the money, but he is a Catholic so he does notbelieve in divorce.       The show is about her conniving with Benny to separate Henry fromthe money.  Since the mission fortuitously needs $136,000 forearthquake repairs or it will be closed down, Benny comes up with aningenious scheme that he hopes will get the money from Henry.  Alongthe way, Tanya goes to stay with a sweet gardener named Jesse Torrejo(Danny Nucci from ERASER and THE ROCK), and Jesse gets roped indirectlyinto the con as well.       Benny is a classic con artist.  He laments to Henry that, ""Whoeverinvented money?  Personally, I could kill them.  What with all thefrustrations and temptations.""       The show has an ensemble cast.  Everyone seems at the top of theirform.  The director does let the show drag some, but the cast alwaysgives it their all.  Especially endearing are Boyle and Nucci playingtwo likable and compelling characters.       I have always been a fan of Lara Flynn Boyle, but this has to beher best picture to date.  She plays the role in a low key fashion, andyet manages to own any scene she is in.  I especially like the wayJacques Haitkin filmed her.  He shows that her skin is not your typicalglamour model smooth, and it is full of freckles, and yet, she looksalluring and seductive without doing much more than just standing.       The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is a whimsical blend of xylophonesand flutes.  The script is a delight from beginning to end.  Speakingof the ending, it will have you guessing until the last.  The areseveral endings possible, but in this life affirming little show, itdoesn't really matter which one the writer chooses.  Other than I wishthe director had not let the show bog down as often as he did, and Iwish he had kept the energy a bit higher, I have no other criticisms.A sweet little comedy.       THE BIG SQUEEZE runs about an hour and a half, but the press kitdid not give the exact time.  It is rated R.  There are two fairly tamefistfights, a little sex, fairly mild language, but no nudity.  Thefilm would be fine for any teenager.  I love the show and recommend toyou.  It gets *** in my book. ","Big Squeeze, The",R,1996,3
117,"Based on the novel by humorist Dave Berry, ""Big Trouble"" is an all-starscrewball comedy along the lines of 2001's ""Rat Race."" Running ata fast pace and, at only 85 minutes, ending even faster, the filmis an entertaining fluff piece filled to the rim with big-name actorswho all look to be having a blast. Unfortunately, having such a briefrunning time means compromising the development of any of the characterssatisfactorily, but they're all fun to watch and coast on their natural abilities. Set in the crazy world of Miami, Eliot Arnold (Tim Allen) is a formerPulitzer Prize winning journalist who now runs his own ad agency.Divorced and disliked by his teenage son, Matt (Ben Foster), who delightsin an assassination game involving water pistols with his friends,Eliot's life is turned upside down when he inexplicably gets involvedwith a metal suitcase that secretly has a bomb inside. The suitcasesoon ends up in the hands of, in chronological order, Russian armsdealers, foot fetishist Arthur Herk (Stanley Tucci), and two trailertrash dimwits named Snake (Tom Sizemore) and Eddie (Johnny Knoxville).Also figuring into the plot are Arthur's fed-up wife, Anna (Rene Russo),who take's a liking to Eliot; Anna's daughter, Jenny (Zooey Deschanel),who is friends with Matt; two bumbling cops (Janeane Garofalo, PatrickWarburton); two federal agents (Omar Epps, Dwayne 'Heavy D' Meyers);a down-on-his-luck hitman (Dennis Farina); the Herk's maid (SofiaVergara); and a vagrant with a love for Fritos (Jason Lee). If the plot sounds somewhat complicated, don't let the descriptionand wide range of characters fool you. ""Big Trouble,"" directed byBarry Sonnenfeld (1999's ""Wild Wild West""), is just about as simpleas they come, in a preposterous sort of way. The story doesn't makea whole lot of logical sense, posing as an excuse to line up the fabulousstar players and let them work their magic. For most of the film,that is what the majority do.  The two exceptions, ironically, are the two supposed central characters,Eliot and Anna. For all of the laughs and delightful banter betweencastmates, Tim Allen (2001's ""Joe Somebody"") and Rene Russo (2002's""Showtime"") practically seem nonexistent in their roles compared toall of the standouts next to them. They have next to nothing to doand, aside from a playfully absurd scene in which they make out anddestroy an office in the process, aren't offered the type of comic work everyone else is. The most crucial strength of ""Big Trouble"" is the laid-back camaraderieall of the supporter players share. Ben Foster (2001's ""Get Over It""),Zooey Deschanel (2000's ""Almost Famous""), and DJ Qualls (2000's ""RoadTrip""), as the teen friends involved in the water pistol game, getseveral memorable moments. Deschanel is an especially adept actresswho, with more to do, can be exceptional (see ""Almost Famous"" now!).Janeane Garofalo (1999's ""Mystery Men"") is her usual great self, withcaustic attitude and dry humor to spare. The back-and-forth bantershe shares with the equally fine Patrick Warburton (2000's ""Scream3"") is one of the film's strong points.  To watch ""Big Trouble"" is to have a truly great time at the moviesas you see how the many characters savvily interconnect. A plot developmentinvolving a bomb on a plane, which was the cause for this film's delayafter 9-11 (it was originally schedule to be released two weeks after),is thankfully not disturbing or eerie. Instead, a joke about the inadequaciesof airline security is hilarious. The same goes with the peculiarlyloving relationship between a dog and a frog, and an ongoing jokeabout a group of runaway goats.  With that said, it comes as an unmistakable disappointment when thefilm comes to an end so quickly. With so much potential, and a cleverscreenplay by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, it is a letdown whenit comes to the very same thing that is the movie's best aspect: thecharacters. As enjoyable as they all are, they are also empty, makingthe movie seem the same way. For entertainment value, things don'tget much better than ""Big Trouble."" But when it comes to the potential-to-payoffratio, things don't get much more frustrating.",Big Trouble,PG-13,2002,1
118,"As with 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"" and 2002's ""Blue Crush,""""Biker Boyz"" is a sports drama based on a real-life newspaper article(this one written by Michael Gougis). Just because the basis of thestory is purported to be fact, however, does not mean that this bigscreen adaptation is any less silly and lame than if it were fictional.Directed by the curiously-named Reggie Rock Bythewood, ""Biker Boyz""aims to be a floor-rattling piece of pulp excitement while deliveringan ensemble of unconventionally real characters in a serious plotline--andfails at all of the above.  The topic is motorcycle racing. The place is Los Angeles. And nightin and night out, a gaggle of motorcycle gangs compete with each other,the winner receiving whatever the wager consists of. Mere months afterhe saw his mechanic father (Eriq La Salle) die in a freak accident,18-year-old Kid (Derek Luke) plunges headfirst into the world of motorcycleracing, the most taunting and unsurpassed group being the Black Knights,headed by longtime participant Smoke (Laurence Fishburne). In an attemptto belong somewhere and prove that he has what it takes to be thebest, he partners up with fellow newbies Stuntman (Brendan Fehr) andWood (Larenz Tate) to begin hustling. A set of roadblocks appear beforeKid when his mother, Anita (Vanessa Bell Calloway), both finds outhe has been racing behind her back, and divulges in a deep secretshe has kept from him since he was born. From the look of the trailers and television ads for ""Biker Boyz,""one would expect it to be nothing more than a down-and-dirty B-moviewith motorcycle stunts and fast-paced action galore. In actuality,it is a mere soap opera with ludicrous dramatic overtures set aroundan underground sport that fails to even once get your heart pumpingbeyond its normal rate. The racing material, while prevalent, hasbeen statically edited by Terilyn A. Shropshire and drearily lit bycinematographers Greg Gardiner, Amelia Vincent, and Reid Russell,to such a degree that it is more snooze-inducing than adrenaline-fueled.  ""The Fast and the Furious,"" a car-racing flick that is this picture'sobvious inspiration, at least knew it was trashy and took this knowledgeto deliver one genuinely exciting action sequence after the next.There was an energy to the proceedings that, if not making the movienecessarily good, at least distracted the viewer from seeing throughits paper-thin veneer. ""Biker Boyz,"" however, has loftier aspirations,and is only a bigger wipeout because of it. Attempts at character-building moments are superficial, at best, wastinglarge chunks of precious screen time on what amounts to a who's whoof the Cliche Handbook. Save for an effectively subtle scene in whichit is discovered that one of Smoke's gang, Soul Train (an understatedOrlando Jones), makes his living as a respected lawyer, the plot developmentsare laid on thick and sappy. There is a glimmer of something morein the close but troubled dynamic between Kid and his mother, butthe twist involved in their struggle would be better suited for ""OneLife to Live"" rather than a movie called ""Biker Boyz."" Meanwhile,the subplot involving the middle-aged Smoke's reluctance to move ontothe next stage of his life is filled with indifference. Derek Luke, who made a breakthrough debut in 2002's ""Antwone Fisher,""has undeniable charisma, but one would be more adept to see it inthe aforementioned film than here. As Smoke, Laurence Fishburne (1999's""The Matrix"") adds star power and a level of dignity to his role,quite a feat considering the overwrought material. The best performance,easily, is given by Vanessa Bell Calloway (2001's ""The Brothers""),poignantly real as Anita, Kid's mother. The rest of the cast is mostlywindow-dressing: Lisa Bonet (2000's ""High Fidelity"") is Queenie, Smoke'ssometimes-lover; Brendan Fehr (2001's ""The Forsaken"") is Kid's friendand partner Stuntman; Meagan Good (1997's ""Eve's Bayou"") shows promiseas Kid's sweet-faced girlfriend, Tina; and Kadeem Hardison (2002's""Showtime""), Djimon Hounsou (2002's ""The Four Feathers""), and singerKid Rock (2001's ""Joe Dirt"") make little impression. Written with too heavy a hand by director Reggie Rock Bythewood andCraig Fernandez, ""Biker Boyz"" is so muddled in melodramatic theatricsthat it dulls down the action setpieces, while the action setpiecesare so subdued on their own that the melodrama is just the final nailin the coffin of a movie with little to redeem it. The corny and highlyforgettable final product is, one would doubt, what anyone had in mind.",Biker Boyz,PG-13,2003,1
119,"Stephen Daldry's BILLY ELLIOT, originally titled DANCER, can be thought ofas an English working-class version of FLASHDANCE but without any of thelatter's glitz and production numbers.  Telling the story of an 11-year-oldboy named Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) who cuts his boxing lessons in favor ofballet lessons with a bunch of girls in frilly tutus, the movie is a somberproduction that could stand to lighten up a bit.  Set against the grimbackground of a miners' strike in which his dad (Gary Lewis) and brother(Jamie Draven) are participating, the movie wants to be as much a moralityplay as a dance movie.  And, of course, its surroundings will remind viewersof the setting for THE FULL MONTY. Without his father's knowledge, Billy begins to spend his 50 pence not onboxing lessons for which they were intended on a ballet class run by thetough, chain-smoking and sarcastic Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).  Afterasking her piano player to play ""The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow,"" sheremarks, ""Fat Chance!""  She almost immediately recognizes Billy's rawtalent, figuring that he would make a prime candidate for the Royal BalletSchool.   The problem with the movie's choreography is that Billy, as he hams it updancing and jumping around, is so awkward that it's hard for us to recognizethe abilities that his teacher sees.  Moreover, his prancing around, whichmakes up large portions of the story, isn't that compelling.  It's ratherlike watching your neighbor's kids hamming it up in the living room.  Mostof the picture has the boy leaping about joyously but stiffly.  These areheartfelt moments but not particularly convincing ones.   Set in a dirt-poor area of County Durham in Northern England in 1984, theaccents are so thick that you could cut them with a knife and sounintelligible at times that you'll wish that the picture had subtitles.The authentic dialog features the F-word in just about every sentence.  It'sa depressing tale with the inevitable light at the end of the tunnel, whichis another of the film's problems.  No matter how depressingly bleak thesituation, the story follows too predictable an arc.  The widower father isa completely angry caricature until, late in the picture, he makes themiraculous conversion that you can see coming a mile away.   The early scene in which the father first finds out that his son has beenspending the family's little disposable money on ballet lessons is dramatic.Looking so red that he might ignite at any moment, he lectures his son,""Lads do boxing, and football, and wrestling, not friggin' ballet."" The supporting characters are little more than stick figures, which leavesthe boy alone to carry the movie.  The young actor does his best, and,whereas we certainly root for his character, the movie is just too formulaicto be able to recommend it.   BILLY ELLIOT runs 1:40.  It is rated R for language and would be acceptablefor teenagers.  Younger than that is the parent's call, but since it wasrated R only for language, we allowed our son to give it a try as he wantedto.  After all, it is a dancing movie about a boy his age. My son Jeffrey, age 11, didn't like much about the movie and gave it * 1/2.He found the dialog hard to follow and felt the story got strained atseveral points.",Billy Elliot,R,2000,2.5

When lanky, dark-haired Nadia - that's the barely recognizableKidman - appears at the airport, he's stunned - not by her beauty but by thefact that she's a smoker and speaks no English, despite his specific request fora non-smoking woman he could talk to. John tries to send her back but no one at""From Russia With Love"" answers the phone. Meanwhile, Nadia discovers his stashof porno magazines and delights in igniting his kinky bondage fantasies.Mellowing to her sexual ministrations, John buys her a Russian/Englishdictionary and when she points to the word ""birthday,"" he presents her with acake. Just as she's ready to blow out the candles, two thug-like Russians(Mathieu Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel) appear at the door. Obviously, Nadia's beenexpecting them but their menacing presence delivers some tortuous thrillertwists to the romantic relationship. Working with writer/director JezButterworth and cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, Nicole Kidman is captivating,holding the quirky, low-budget picture together. Ben Chaplin (""The Thin RedLine"") cleverly conveys the hapless hero's frustrated repression, while MathieuKassovitz (actor in ""Amelie"" and director of ""Hate"" ) and Vincent Cassel (""TheMessenger"") cavort with their comical Russian characterizations and StephenWarbeck's musical score reflects the many mood changes.

Inso many ways, the writer (Caroline Thompson and Anna Sewell) and thedirector (Caroline Thompson) made just the right choices in how to makethis classic book come to life on the screen.       BLACK BEAUTY is the story of a (boy) horse from its birth (a greatscene) to its puberty (along with the classic girl rejection scene) andthen through his adult life.  Just as in human life, there are masters(read bosses) that are wise and kind and other that are stupid andmean.  Also, as we humans have found, there are friends who mean a lotto us.  This is a movie that does not pull the punches.  Bad thingslook like they might happen on several occasions and sometimes theyreally do.  This, of course, makes love and triumph even moreappreciated.       Too often the producers of kids movie take no risks.  Thehomogenized and safe movie they end up with, offends no one, but boreshalf of the audience.  Producers Peter MacGregor-Scott and RobertShapiro were willing to take risks and they made the movie that trulycomes alive with all of the spices, joys, anguish, fears, and triumphsof real life.       Besides the perfect scripting and directing, there are many othermarvelous aspects to the show.  Alex Thomson's cinematography showedthe setting of the English countryside in the Fall, and it never lookedmore lovely with its golden radiance.  The city was made to look darkand foreboding in contrast.  Clearly, the countryside was heaven andthe city, hell, BUT here we find some bad people in heaven and somegood people in hell.       The many actors in the show (Peter Cook, David Thewlis, JohnMcEnery, Eleanor Bron, Sean Bean, etc.) were all top-notch.  The starnevertheless was Black Beauty.  I believe that even people who don'tcare much for horses would love this show - it is that good.       The key ingredient for success in the show, was having a strongnarration throughout by Black Beauty himself.  We know Black Beauty'severy thought.  This was not done in some trite fashion as in all thosemovies where the babies talk to us.  Instead, we have a Scottish actor(Alan Cumming) delivering a beautiful and melodious rendition of thehorse's inner thoughts.       The show makes you feel as if you had been reincarnated and were ahorse in 19th century England.  This it should be point out was not aneasy time to be a horse because people used them for everything frompulling a taxicab to pulling heavy coaches to being the semi (lorry toyou British readers) of their time to just generally being worked untilyou dropped if you got a cruel owner. ",Black Beauty,G,1994,3.5
122,"I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. Cool and adult for a 1979Disney movie. The soundtrack is impressive and there were some scenes that eally scared me at that time. Hehe. Think about the zombie crew onDr.Reinhardt's spaceship or his robot pal, Maximillian. Therealso a couple of typical Disney charachters... in this case two robots,VinC.E.N.T. and Old Bob.

123," I'm going to keep this one fairly short, folks. In fact, I'm not even goingto attempt a plot summary because there isn't any plot in ""Black and White"".James Toback, previously responsible for releasing the atrocious ""Two Girlsand a Guy"" on unsuspecting audiences back in 1997, has created a true pieceof garbage here. This is the kind of movie that screams for an NC-17 rating,being filled with fairly explicit sex scenes, constant violence, and morefoul language than you hear in any Quentin Tarantino film. The MPAA ratingsystem is supposed to keep kids from seeing a movie like this, but thetheater I saw it in was filled with young high school students. I know it'snaive to think that kids won't see a movie like this no matter what kind ofrating it has, yet I can't help but think an NC-17 rating would haveprevented at least a few kids from attending.  First I'll try to cover what I liked about this movie, which shouldn't taketoo long. There are one or two slightly comical moments, though I can't seemto remember what they involved. That about sums up what I liked about thismovie. I don't often award one or five star ratings, but I was very temptedto give only one to this piece of filth. I knew I was in trouble as soon asthe film started with a semi-pornographic scene involving two of the maincharacters (Bijou Phillips, Power) and one minor character in a threesome inthe middle of the woods. I suppose the purpose of this scene was to conveyhow messed up these kids are, but it struck me as being present only forshock value. In fact, there are several sex scenes sprinkled throughout""Black and White"" which enhance the so-called story in no way.  I will hand one thing to Toback, he pulled in quite a cast. Ben Stiller,Robert Downey Jr., Brooke Shields, Claudia Schiffer, and the great JoePantoliano all make appearances in this god forsaken movie. Stiller(""There's Something About Mary"") plays a gambler (a somewhatautobiographical decision by Toback I think) who appears very few times andnever quite fits in with the rest of the movie. Robert Downey Jr. (thehorrendous ""Two Girls and a Guy"") plays a gay man, who I believe wasintended to be humorous but was simply vulgar instead. Brooke Shields (""TheBlue Lagoon"") and Claudia Schiffer both show up in very minor roles, whichdistract the audience rather than add anything to the movie. Last, butcertainly not least, is Joe Pantoliano (""The Matrix"", ""Bound""), who iscompletely wasted as a father of two of the young, stupid characters.Showing up in a hilariously pointless cameo is Mike Tyson himself.  Allow me to now point out the half dozen or so items which make this ahorrendous movie. One, half the dialogue is completely unintelligble. Thecharacters banter back and forth, swearing every other word and sayingthings which no one over the age of fifteen could possibly understand. Two,there is no plot to speak of. There are a few subplots involving things likesports gambling and coping with ones identity, but none of these sidestories are ever developed. Three, I think this was supposed to be aprofound look at racism and life in an inner city, but it succeeds only atinsulting members of both races. Fourth, there is no direction whatsoever.The movie jumps aimlessly from person to person and situation to situationwithout any idea where it is going. Lastly, the film's ending left me with asick feeling in my stomach. I normally don't give away plot points, but themovie's ending seems to imply that family can triumph over anything by doingthings like pulling together to lie and cover up murders. ""Black and White""runs the longest 98 minutes you'll ever experience. I recommend it toabsolutely no one and give it one and a half out of five stars. ",Black and White,R,2000,1.5
124,"In our time a good science fiction film is a rare artifact and a truetreasure. The essence, the heart of the genre, the endless possibilities ofimagination are now replaced with primitive action sequences and impressivespecial effects. The result is that the genre (especially in the 90s) hasbecome a synonimum for dumb and predictable ""popcorn films"". That is why wehave to look back at the time passed to find good science fiction films.Every genre has its masterpieces. And ""Blade Runner"" is one of them. As afalling star it has lit up the sky, opening new ways of science fiction bydefining its own genre.  Not since Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has it been such a complex,thought provoking  and sophisticated science fiction film. It is a strangelycompelling and humanistic detective story, set in L.A., year 2019. Humanityhas expanded far beyond the Earth, engaged in the eternal quest for newfrontiers. Those left behind are too old, infirm, poor or stubborn to escapefor the off-world colonies; they're stuck with the dregs of civilization, asrepresented by a gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles. The only flies in theointment are artificial humans, colloquially known as replicants, deployedin the most hazardous of environments. These artificial humans are designedto serve man, by doing all the ""dirty"" and dangerous work, such as warfareand collonisation of other planets. In their latest incarnation, Nexus 6,these replicants have surpassed their makers, a moment of transition. OnEarth rogue replicants are outlawed, a hazard that demands execution. Sowhen a replicant unit is discovered in LA, the police assign their bladerunner division to the clean-up operation. It seems that the replicants aretrying to infiltrate the Tyrell Corporation, the monolithic entity thatbuilt them, presided over by genius Eldon Tyrell (Joseph Turrkel). RickDecard (Harrison Ford) is one of the unfortunate blade runners, that arestuck on earth, forced into taking up the chase.  ""Blade Runner"" is a brilliant analyses of the earth, human kind, itsdevelopment and evolution. An interesting fact is that Chinese has becomethe new main language, since the world is mostly populated by the orientalpopulation. The world of the future is cold, dark and unfriendly. It is atime of decay, fear, trash,neon and promises of clean air, blue waters andgreen grass. The film also presents a great deal of dazzling special effectsand some of the most original art direction I have ever seen. From the verybeginning of the film we see the grand skyscrapers and buildings that arisefrom the dark, almost dead soil. The art director has been inspired by theMayan and Egyptian architecture, combining it with Ultra modern art design.The result is mesmerizing and wonderfully imaginative, and yet nevercompletely alien.  Director Ridley Scott has transformed Philip K. Dick's novel 'Do AndroidsDream of Electric Sheep?' beyond recognition. Along side with screenwritersHampton Fancher and David Peoples, he uses his ideas as a philosophicallaunching pad. The film takes place in the middle of a silent war betweenhumans and artificial humans. Through the film both sides pose the very sameglobal questions: who am I? where am I going? This leads the audience toconcider the very essence of humanity itself. What makes us human? Memories?Sentience? Thoughts? Ideas? Feelings? Does it really matter if they arartificial? And if they are, does it make them less human? This is allthought provoking and original material that has been copied throughout theyears. Surprisingly enough, the film loose as fresh and original as at itspremiere in 1982.  The cast, consisting of 10 cast members, is nothing less than fabulous.Harrison Ford is believable as the sad and quite Deckard - angry, hurt andvulnerable. Forced to stay on earth, with no choice but to hunt for thereplicants. Falling in a certain apathy, he feels that he has absolutelynothing to live for. His love interest, played by Sean Young, portraysinnocence and vulnerability, warmth and consideration, projecting an imageof what we concider humanity. When she turns out to be a replicant, we areforced to pose the basic question: what makes us human? Rutger Huer, as theleader of the rebel replicants, is the most captivating. He is charismaticvia lyricism, some memorable lines (""All those memories will be lost intime..like tears in the rain..""), but mostly by his pationate nature anddesperate love of life. Off course  there are some characters in this filmthat are created to give a more vivid and live image of future society. Theingenious creator of the replicants, Dr.Eldon Tyrel (Joseph Turel) is acold, sinister character that became corrupted by the opportunity of playingGod. Another interesting character is J.F.Sebastion, a previously attractiveand respected genetic designer, he is now suffering of a terrible illnessthat stops him from moving to the Off-world colonies. Living in almostcomplete isolation, he makes his own friends, creatures that resemblecharacters from fairytales and sagas, so that he won't feel alone. There aremany bizarre characters and events in the film that make it more interestingand captivating. The fabulous cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth, combinedwith Richard Hart's lightning frames the characters and the story in beautyand imagination. All are the part of the warmly , symbolic whole, a moodenchanted by Vangelis' magical and dreamy score. A music that is intimateand distant at the same time. This may be the best soundtrack Vangelis evercreated.  The film ends in a monstrous, violent and emotionally engaging finale, thatmakes a lasting impression. 'Blade Runner' is a unique film, incredible onevery level. This is a prophetic and emotional tale that stands out as oneof the most original and intellectual science fiction films ever made. ",Blade Runner,R,1982,4
125," What would the world look like to you if you had grown up in a plush,multi-room suburban bomb fallout shelter that was supposed to be arefuge from the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis? That's the premise of thisgenial comedy that begins underground.  Raised with only his paranoidparents - dutiful yet frustrated Sissy Spacek and brilliantscientist/inventor Christopher Walken - as role models and completelyisolated from outside information, Brendan Fraser (""George of theJungle"") has a decidedly wholesome '60s value system. When he comes tothe surface of modern-day Los Angeles for supplies - and, perhaps, abride - he must keep his history a secret, which causes lots ofcomplications when he meets beautiful but hard-edged AliciaSilverstone, who doesn't know what to make of this gentle, impossiblywell-mannered and archaically dressed hunk of adorable naivete.  Nordoes her platonic room-mate, David Foley, whose overt homosexualityFraser never quite picks up on. Directed and co-written by Hugh Wilsonwith Bill Kelly, it's conceptually the opposite of ""Pleasantville,""which threw two contemporary teens into the monochromatic world of a'50s sitcom. But, while ""Pleasantville"" addressed some serious issues,this frothy fluff is heavy into sheer silliness - and far too muchtime is clumsily wasted on the elaborate set-up for the actualstory. Once again, Brendan Fraser proves his adroitness as a lovable,innocent goofball in a fish-out-of-water situation and, if you'reintrigued by this young actor, I highly recommend you see him sparwith Ian McKellen in ""Gods and Monsters."" On the Granger Movie Gaugeof 1 to 10, ""Blast from the Past"" is a sweetly satirical 7. Frothyfun. ",Blast from the Past,PG-13,1999,2.5
126," ""Bliss"" is an enthralling motion picture, and one of the most educational films I've ever seen, but that is where it somewhat runs into problems, because it plays as an instructional guide on making your sex life better, rather than one that has a thorough story and characters.  ""Bliss"" tells of Joseph (Craig Sheffer) and Marie (Sheryl Lee), two newlyweds who are having some trouble relating to each other sexually. While at an appointment with their sex therapist (Spalding Gray), Joseph is surprised and upset when Maria admits that she has never had an orgasm while making love to him, instead faking it each time. Meanwhile, at the construction site where he works, Joseph and his coworkers delight in spying on an older man, who constantly all day, has different women come in his apartment and have sex with him, until Joseph sees Maria going in there one day. When Joseph goes to confront him at his apartment, he discovers that the man, named Baltazar Vincenza, also works as a sex therapist ""on the edge of the law,"" and that Maria has been secretly going to him. Baltazar believes that he can help all people with their love lives, but that first, his customers must understand that the highest point in a sexual relationship is not an orgasm, but ""emotional bliss.""  I don't really want to give anything else away, since there are a few surprises that occur towards the end that should be discovered on their own, and from reading my synopsis, I am sure it does not sound like your usual drama.   The central storyline between the couple could be described as uninvolving, since much of the picture takes place during the training sessions between Joseph and Baltazar, but the reason that, ""Bliss,"" is a worthwhile film to see is because I feel that I learned a lot from it, and the subject was treated in a mature, respectful manner.  Craig Sheffer and Sheryl Lee are both appealing actors, and they are very good here, creating a lot of warmth in the scenes they were in together. And Terence Stamp is just right as this mysterious man who says he has the answer to all people's sexual sufferings.  When I said that, ""Bliss,"" is a worthwhile motion picture to see, the target audience I was referring to were people from about ages 16 and up. The material dealt with in this film contains many sexually graphic sequences, and in order for the true point of the film to be fully understood, it really is only for more older viewers. ""Bliss,"" is an intelligent and informative instruction guide, but it does not offer much more than that, nor should it have to. ",Bliss,R,1997,2
127,"Hollywood treats romances between people of a certain ageonly gingerly. Rarely has a blockbuster dealt with an elderly,retired law enforcement officer with a bad ticker who ignores hisdoctor's advice and chases criminals as though he were arookie out to make a name for himself and get promoted.  In""Blood Work,"" the seventy-two year old Clint Eastwood, whodirects, produces and stars in this essentially routine crimesaga, not only gets to romance a woman some three decadesyounger than he is (and she's the one who hits on him) butsucceeds in solving a case that the local ignorant copsprematurely consider closed. What saves ""Blood Work"" from being an egregious exampleof a same ol' same ol' crime story is a plot machination thatscripted Brian Helgeland must have thought unusual enoughfrom Michael Connelly's novel.  The law officer, formerly withthe FBI and now working on a crime without a license, has notonly had a serious heart attack which forced his exit from thebureau but has received the heart of a young woman who wasbrutally killed during a liquor-store robbery.  Cops think themotive of the ski-masked bandit, captured clearly on video, wasto avoid a life sentence if fingered by witnesses.  Already a twotime loser, under California law, any witness convincing a juryabout the identity of a robber would send him up the river forlife.  Better to kill all witnesses: what's there to lose?   But former agent Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood), a famousFBI man who regularly captures headlines for his expert policework, second-guesses himself, allowing us in the audience toshare with him the challenge of breaking the killer's code whichwould yield the identity of the perp. ""Blood Work"" takes us to the San Pedro, California scene ofan ATM murder in which McCaleb, believing a person in thecrowd of rubberneckers is the shooter, chases the man downand surprisingly for his age is about to catch him.  When a heartattack foils the arrest, McCaleb is treated by cardiologist Dr.Bonnie Fox (Angelica Huston), who puts him on a daily regimeof 34 pills and warns him to take things slow.  When McCaleb ispetitioned by the sister of the dead woman, Graciela Rivers(Wanda De Jesus), to bring the murderer to justice, he enlistshis neighbor in an adjacent boat, Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels) asa chauffeur as he proceeds through the southern Cal area toenlist the help of his friends and is likewise shunned by theenvious precinct cop, Detective Arrange (Paul Rodriguez). The chemistry between Eastwood and De Jesus is more thansatisfactory as McCaleb, with the help of a former buddy andpolice officer Jaye Winston (Tina Lifford) pursue clues and getsurprising help from the dead woman's young boy, Raymond(Mason Lucero).  The road-and-buddy relationship betweenNoone and McCaleb is amusing, the identity of the murdererpossibly guessed by some in the audience.  But this is not aconventional mystery but more of a character study of a not-yet-over-the-hill peacemaker who will not go gently into retirementbut who persists doggedly in outsmarting the LAPD officials whoall too eagerly close the case before the real villain is found. Eastwood, a legend since his opening roles in spaghettiWesterns by Sergio Leone almost two-score years ago, hadmoved into more mature, critically acclaimed films with theopening of ""Unforgiven"" in 1992.  ""Blood Work,"" like Eastwood's1992 breakthrough, deals with a man who comes out ofretirement, in that film as a hit man who needs one more scoreto make some money.  Unlike ""Unforgiven,"" his current offeringlacks the exploration of morality and hypocrisy and despite fineperformances, a nice view of San Pedro Harbor, and a neat jazzscore by Lennie Niehaus, has heart but is not particularlycompelling or fresh.",Blood Work,R,2002,2.5
128,"What to do when a dramatic event takes place, one thatchanges the makeup of a social system, and no one is around tofilm the action?  Paul Greenglass, who both directed and scripted""Bloody Sunday,"" would porbably like to have filmed the events ofone tragic day in January of 1972 but, actual film footage beingabsent, he did a remarkable job of creating a docu-drama of anoccurrence which has been all but forgotten outside the borders ofNorthern Ireland.  With cinematographer Ivan Strasburg traininghis lens on a few streets in the town of Derry, N. Ireland, ""BloodySunday"" is such a vivid re-creation of that fateful day, camerazigging and zagging with lightning speed during the climacticmoments of the demonstration, that we could swear that we'rewatching a documentary; even better, a doc without egotisticaltalking heads and an intrusive soundtrack to take away from theseriousness of the bloodshed. ""Bloody Sunday"" assumes that members of the audience haveat least a marginal knowledge of the troubles faced in thatcorner of the world, when two Irish counties were separated byagreement from the rest of that verdant land and remainedattached to the mother country of Great Britain.  Despite decadesof radical activity by the Irish Republic Army to wrest control fromBritish hands, Northern Ireland which is about 2/3 Protestant and1/3 Catholic remains a colony (if you listen to the Catholics) andan integral part of Great Britain (as most Protestant will tell you.) Though some critics have called the movie an even-handeddepiction of events of the fateful day when Irish protesterscame up against the British army, Greenglass has no such intent. The filmmaker present the predominantly Catholic group aspeaceful marchers whom the British could have ignored altogethersince, after all, Catholics were not taking arms against the hatedsoldiers.  Instead the British blockaded the streets of theanticipated demonstration and, when faced with the hurling ofstones at first used the water hose to disperse the marchers, thentheir rubber bullets, and finally inexplicably, live ammunition.  Notonly do the British kill thirteen Irish but in one instance they shoota man point blank who was already lying the ground and anotherwho was waving a white flag.  No weapons were found on any ofthe dead. The central figure of the story is a Protestant member ofParliament who is highly respected by the Catholics of the districthe represents.  Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt), a firebrand whononetheless cites as his heroes Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhiand who insists not only that weapons be banned at thedemonstration but that even stone-throwing would not betolerated, is at first disappointed when a group of young peoplecalled ""hooligans"" by the British break away from the main sectorof the crowd and begin pelting the troops with stones.  The British,fearing that a successful march will embolden the radicalelements of the I.R.A., are determined to assert their dominanceand ultimately resort to the use of live ammunition, firing even afterthe commander orders a cease-fire.  A press conference heldunder the auspices of the Northern Ireland Civil Right Association,condemns the butchery while the British go through a predictablewhitewash. In many cases the English language becomes difficultto decipher (though no nearly as much as Scottish dialects whichsometimes use English subtitles for an American audience), butwe at no time are at a loss in appreciating the emotions of thecrowd once the bullets begin flying.  Since the I.R.A., which somepeople believe was dying out as a force against the British, hadyoung people lining up to join after the flat-out murder by Britishtroops, some in the audience might compare the bloody day withevents in the Middle East where allegedly Palestinian ChairmanArafat, recently losing his stature, gained the status of a martyrby a series of attacks against him by Israeli forces. This movie might remind the movie buff of one opening at aboutthe same time, ""Das Experiment,"" in which an experiment is setup  with one group assigned to be prisoners and another to beguards.  As the prisoners begin annoying the guards, the latterbegin to hit back until soon the guards, who are holding the cards,commit to violence far beyond what is needed to control theirprisoners.  Similarly, history buffs will recall Red Sunday inRussia when a group of citizens marching peacefully in 1905 weremowed down by the Russian forces, eventually leading to full-scale revolt twelve years later.  ""Bloody Sunday"" is a visceraldrama with universal relevance, a warning to government forcestoday as then to act with restraint lest they be hoist with their ownpetard.",Bloody Sunday,R,2002,2.5
129,"""Blow"" is based on the real life experiences of George Jung, once one ofthe most successful illegal drug importers on the planet. Back in thelate '60s and early '70s, the psychedelic youth brigade of Americawhiled away their free time peacefully with assorted hallucinogens andall the marijuana they could get their hands on. Then George entered themarketplace with incredible quantities of cocaine and the scene turnedugly. In other words, George Jung was the kid who spoiled it for the rest ofthe class. Jung claims responsibility for bringing in at least 85 percent of thecocaine that entered the United States during the late 1970s. Hmmmmm. Itmay be true, but then again, former vice-president Al Gore claims thatthe lead characters in ""Love Story"" were based on him and his wife,Tipper. And for what it's worth, I single-handedly popularized salt andvinegar potato chips in the Midwest. Regardless, Jung is generally acknowledged as the key American behindthe cocaine tsunami. After reading Brian Porter's decades-spanningrags-to-riches-to-rags biography about the Uber-dealer, director TedDemme (""Monument Avenue"") decided this was a story that must bepresented on the big screen. Had ""Scarface,"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""BoogieNights"" never been made, he might have been right. But in the wake ofthose movies, ""Blow"" is unable to overcome a ""been there, done that""feel. To be fair, there are perks to be had. Johnny Depp contributes afine performance in the lead role, a few of the supporting players aredecent and Demme offers some nice stylistic touches. Still, theproduction comes off as little more than a variation of a well-worntheme. The story begins in George's 1950s childhood home in Massachusetts. Hisfather Fred (Ray Liotta) is a plumber with a strong work ethic and aneven stronger love of his boy, while his shrewish mother Ermine (RachelGriffiths) seems more concerned with her standing in the neighborhoodthan with the well being of her family. In 1968, George and his best friend Tuna (Ethan Suplee) move to aCalifornia beach town, where they discover the joys of girls and ganja.When their cash runs short, the boys decide that - get ready for this -they could make money by (a drum roll, please) selling marijuana! Thefilm presents this as if it was the first time anyone came up with sucha concept. George's stewardess girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente from ""Run LolaRun"") hooks him up with Derek (Paul Reubens), a sly hairdresser whoenjoys freaking out newcomers with his effeminate mannerisms. Derekfronts the boys a bag of weed and, in short order, they establish alively business with the college crowd back in Boston, manageablebecause of Barbara's ability to serve as courier. Cut to 1970, where George and Barbara live large while operating out ofAcapulco, until George gets popped in Chicago with over 600 pounds ofthe herb. He ends up serving time with Colombian Diego Delgado (JordiMolla), who hooks him up with the Medellin drug cartel. Bada bing, badaboom, George becomes THE Colombian cocaine pipeline to the States. Needless to say, there are complicating factors. Visits with the parentsare dicey, as Mom has a nasty habit of calling the cops on her son.George creates ill will by wooing and eventually marrying Mirtha(Penelope Cruz), the squeeze of a Medellin big wheel. Finally, George'sfriends in the cartel are mighty interested in learning the name of hismain connection on the West Coast. While the film has a number of powerful scenes, the story arc is just asyou would expect and, when the inevitable downfall begins, everythingdrags. Demmes tries to jazz things up by using camera gimmicks common toeach decade of the story (faux home movies for the '50s, rainbowzippiness for the '60s, washed out colors and lots of zooms for the'70s, yadda, yadda, yadda). The visuals are moderately engaging, but notenough to overcome the overwhelming sense of d_jö vu. The same goes with the performances. Depp is very good and Liottaprovides welcome support as the loving, nonjudgmental papa.Unfortunately, to denote the passage of time, both men must wear fakebellies that are, ahem, a bit less than convincing. Paul Reubens alsodoes solid work, creating a sense of playful wickedness in hissupporting role. The rest of the cast is comprised of the expectedstereotypes, with Griffiths and Cruz consistently annoying as one-noteharridans. While ""Blow"" has a fair share of rewards, it is a decidedly minor movie.Still, many early reviews of the film have been positively gushing. Why?I can think of only one reason - when they saw the flick, them damncritics were all hopped up on coke.",Blow,R,2001,3
130,"BLOW DRY, which the ads loudly proclaim to be by the writer of THE FULLMONTY, has all the charm of a fifth generation copy of a tape of THE FULLMONTY, which is what it feels like.  Writer Simon Beaufoy recycles all ofthe elements of the plot that hit the jackpot for him last time.  The storyis set in a cheesy working-class English town.  There's a tragedy to becoped with -- this time it's cancer rather than unemployment.  And, ofcourse, he ends it in one of his signature surprises.  It's too bad thatthis time he forgot to make it funny.  To be fair, much of the blame has togo to director Paddy Breathnach, who wasn't associated with THE FULL MONTYor anything else you've ever heard of before BLOW DRY. Set in Keighley, England, the movie is about the National HairdressingChampionship, a veritable hair Olympics.  The cocksure Ray Roberts (BillNighy) and his assistant Louis (Hugh Bonneville) are competing for theirthird straight title.  Cheating his way to the top again, Ray fears onlylocal barber Phil Allen (Alan Rickman) and his assistant, Phil's son Brian(Josh Hartnett).  Phil quit the hairdressing competition 10 years ago whenhis wife, Shelley (Natasha Richardson) left him to live with Sandra (RachelGriffiths), his hairdressing model.  The script does little with thislesbian subtheme other than introduce it. Brian makes extra money by working the graveyard shift, cutting hair at thelocal mortuary.  Brian takes Ray's daughter and model, Christina (RachaelLeigh Cook), there one night on a date.  Although the movie's cast is good,their acting isn't much more lively than the corpses lying around waiting tohave their hair done.  Actually, the whole movie is about as dead as thesestiffs.

131,"In Karen Moncrieff's rambling but ultimately fulfilling BLUE CAR,Meg is a troubled high school student about to win a local poetrycontest.  With encouragement from Mr. Auster, her AP English teacher,she hopes to find some way to get to Florida for the national finalsafter she wins locally.    In a touching and understated performance, Agnes Bruckner (MURDERBY NUMBERS) plays Meg.  Less effective is David Strathairn's remotereading of her English teacher.  When Mr. Auster describes the burialof his four-year-old son, he sounds downright clinical about it, asif the tragedy happened to someone else entirely. Although Meg has real talent, her mother, Diane (Margaret Colin),couldn't care less.  Diane is too busy for Meg or Meg's younger sister,Lily (Regan Arnold).  Lily does everything from cutting herself tostarving herself in failed attempts to get her mother's attention. When Meg tells her mother that Lily hasn't eaten anything in twoweeks, her mother isn't the least bit concerned, reasoning that Lilyis probably eating something at school.  The girls' father -- theparents are divorced -- shows up only at major holidays.  Meg is convincedthat it's because her mother is impossible to be around.  Based solelyon our observations, it would appear that Meg is probably right. Although it is far from a perfect film, the story provides such apoignant and believable characterization of Meg that it easily touches your heart. BLUE CAR runs 1:36.

132,"""Better late than never"" is the phrase that could be appliedto BLUE SKY, 1994 drama directed by Tony Richardson. Shot in1991, but not released due to the bankruptcy of OrionPictures, this movie was finally unearthed three yearslater. It was too late for its director Richardson who haddied from AIDS shortly after the end of shooting, but notfor the rest of cast and crew, especially Jessica Lange whosurprised many by getting an ""Oscar"" for the role in thisfilm.  The plot of this film is set in the year 1962, during themost intense period of Cold War. Major Hank Marshall (playedby Tommy Lee Jones) is a scientist assigned to helpconducting nuclear bomb tests. Being a radiation expert, heis too aware of the effects those tests may have on theenvironment and civilian population so he wants to abandonatmospheric tests in favour of much safer, subterraneantests. The military higher-ups don't particularly like hisheretical views, but most of the Hank's problems come fromhis family, namely his wife Carly (played by Jessica Lange).She is very attractive yet emotionally unstable and hermanic phases tend to manifest in public outbursts ofscandalous behaviour and open flirting with other men. Hanksnevertheless loves his wife and he is always able to forgiveher, but not the military authorities who handle thisperpetual scandal by relocating Marshall, his wife and twodaughters from one base after another. The latest relocationbrought them from Hawaii to the ugly, run-down Army base inAlabama. The base commander Vince Johnson (played by PowersBoothe) is soon attracted to the glamorous scientist's wife.  The plot for BLUE SKY consists of two stories, each of themsuitable for feature film of its own. One depicts thestruggle of lone individual against all-powerfulorganisation and it could serve as an excellent historylesson for post-Chernobyl generations, showing them thementality of Cold War, which sacrificed environment,individual lives, basic morality and common sense for thesake of nuclear supremacy. This Strangelovian story isfollowed by more intimate yet equally fascinating love storybetween Mr. and Mrs. Marshall. Unlike most of Hollywood lovestories, this one shows the often very painful sacrificespeople must make in order to have something resembling agood relationship. Mixing those two stories into one plotcould have looked like a recipe for disaster, but screenplayRama Laurie Stagner, Arlene Sarner and Jerry Leichtingsucceeds in that. The script has some of the cliches,including melodramatic, predictable and not very convincingfinale, but the characters and their interactions arewell-drawn and the story in general engaging from start tofinish. The best job was done by actors. Jessica Lange trulydeserved her ""Oscar"" - her portrayal of Carly is wonderful,both on the outside (especially in scenes where she bringstouch of Monroesque Hollywood glamour and sexuality to thedreary and dull setting of early 1960s US military) andinside, when she makes us understand why her husband lovesher so much despite the endless series of humiliation andembarrassment. Tommy Lee Jones is also very good in the roleof a man whose love is stronger than machistic pride, andwhose stoicism in matters of heart manifests as virtue inmatters of military ethics. Amy Locane, who was very youngduring the production of this film, is very remarkable inthe role of Marshalls' older daughter Alexandra. All in all,BLUE SKY, despite some flaws, is an interesting and touchingdrama that deserves more attention than its single ""Oscar""might indicate. ",Blue Sky,PG-13,1994,2.5
133,"Less than a week ago Pope visited my town, and such,once-in-a-decade, event caused a lot of commotion among itscitizens. Traffic was stopped, all the city services were inthe state of emergency, and many aspects of everyday lifeweren't there any more. But, those were just a annoyancescompared with the huge security operation that lasted weeksand months before the event. Both regular and secret policewas conducting door-to-door searches of all the apartmentsand houses on the Pope's route; those who hadn't beenvisited by police had to endure endless sounds ofhelicopters flying over their heads and peeping into theirhomes in search of imaginary terrorists and assassins.Probably the very same thing happened in Los Angeles in theeve of 1984 Olympic Games. Fears of all-powerful andall-controlling government corresponded with the Year ofOrwell, and movie producers in Los Angeles were affected byit just like any other citizens. Their paranoia actuallyinspired them to make a techno-thriller BLUE THUNDER, nowalmost forgotten, but in its time regarded as one of thebest action movies of all times.  The movie's hero is Frank Murphy (Roy Scheider), helicopterpilot in Los Angeles Police Department, who does his job offlying policeman very well, despite the traumas he sufferedin Vietnam. After being united with rookie pilot Lymangood(Daniel Stern), he must test the new prototype of nextgeneration police helicopter - Blue Thunder. The machine isequipped with automatic cannons, armour, ultra- sensitivemicrophones and cameras, and with its silent engines cansneak into any part of the city almost unnoticed and wreakhavoc or spy the unsuspecting inhabitants. Such powerfulhelicopter is to be used as part of security for theOlympics, or so the Federal people, led by Colonel Cochrane(Malcolm McDowell), his Vietnam nemesis, say to suspiciousMurphy. But after he finds evidence that connects urbanriots and the death of city official with the Blue Thunderproject, his life is in danger. In order to save himself andwarn the public, Murphy steals Blue Thunder and instantlybecomes the target of spectacular manhunt by police andmilitary.  One of the things that makes this movie so different fromother contemporary action hits is its leftistanti-government agenda, which is in huge contrast withneoconservative American jingoism, so strong in Hollywoodduring the Reagan years. Instead of being the celebration ofnew military and police technology, BLUE THUNDER clearlywarns the people of its possible abuses (even in the firstshot, when the caption says that the ""technology depicted inthis film is real and in use in USA today""). Some of thoseabuses might be quite harmless - like the crew of policehelicopters that peep into bedrooms of beautiful women, butit also can become quite frightening, like a recorded caseof adultery. From those small abuses it takes the reallysmall step to the huge conspiracy that would bring mayhem tounsuspecting public and throw them into the jaws ofomnipotent police state. Those who want to control themasses from the air don't even need technologicalsuperwonders like Blue Thunder; regular helicopters areenough to make life miserable for any opposition in theground.  Unfortunately, very good screenplay by talented Dan O'Bannonuses this dark overtones of 1970s political paranoia only inthe first half. The carefully paced development of the plotserves only as an overture before the grand finale, when thepolitically conscious writer gives reign to action-orienteddirector. The ominous machine in the hands of the powerfulconspirators is introduced in a shot that presents it as athreatening monster; however, when our protagonist gets ahand to it, it becomes a weapon of a superhero. The directorJohn Badham, whose filmography shows that he can makemasterpieces when given a good script (unfortunately, thatdidn't happen in more than a decade), is using the secondpart to make one of the most effective and impressive actionscene in the last two decades of Hollywood movies. With theelements of chase and dogfight, and very cleverly donespecial effects (something very hard to imagine in today'scomputer- generated era) he uses the superb editing of thereactions bellow to give some pseudo-documentary feel tothis action fantasy. He is so effective in it, that theviewer forgets to ask the simple questions, like ""how canthousands of explosive rounds and numerous missiles can befired in the middle of crowded city without single civiliancasualty"". However, suspension of disbelief is somewhatover- stretched in the last scene, when the highlyimplausible final dogfight between Cochrane and Murphyserves only to finish the story with the clich‰ moreappropriate for Playstation action games than serious movie.  Despite the silliness at the end, BLUE THUNDER as a whole isa exceptional piece of good Hollywood cinema. The actors aresuperb - Roy Scheider is very believable as a reluctant herowho works well despite the stress and war traumas. DanielStern looks charming as a boyish sidekick, so different fromthe psychos he played in the later parts of his career. Suchrole is, on the other hand, somewhat overplayed by usuallycreepy Malcolm McDowell, who didn't even bother to get ridof the English accent (it was easier to write his Englishbackground in the story than to hire a dialogue coach).Other supporting actors are good, especially Warren Oates inhis last role as Scheider's sympathetic boss. The electronicmusic of Arthur B. Rubinstein, with its enchanting yetmenacing theme, works very well in order to enhance themovie's gloomy atmosphere. All in all, BLUE THUNDER is amovie that should be both the real inspiration for themakers of future action cinema and the warning to all thosewho forget how helpless the individual can be against thegovernment. ",Blue Thunder,R,1983,3
134,"      BLUE IN THE FACE was made by the same directors (Wayne Wang andPaul Auster) that made the highly acclaimed SMOKE.  In fact, the wholereason that BLUE IN THE FACE was made was that the directors and thecast found that they had an extra week on their hands, so hey, theydecided to make a fast, improvisational movie with the same sets andsome of the same cast.  The result is a fun, upbeat movie that isanother talk fest just like SMOKE, but not as serious - think of it asSMOKE-lite.       BLUE IN THE FACE is a series of vignettes.  The writing iscredited to the directors, but it feels like the actors were winging itmost of the time.  The movie is again set in the Brooklyn Cigar Companyrun by Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel) but owned by Vinnie (Victor Argo).The subject this time is Belgium waffles, Jackie Robinson (KeithDavid), the passing of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the destruction ofEbbets Field.  A subplot has Vinnie closing the cigar shop to turn itinto a health food store since, ""Tobacco is out.  Wheat germ is in.""There is also attempted infidelity and robbery, but most of all, it isjust a bunch of good friends of all ethnic groups standing around andgabbing about life.       The picture starts with a 10 year old kid (Sharif Rashed) stealingthe handbag of a beautiful, miniskirted, young woman (Mira Sorvino fromBarcelona).  Auggie chases the kid down only to have the woman say lethim go.  Auggie takes the bag from the woman and gives it to the kidand tells him to beat it.  She is nonplused.  The movie is a series ofcrazy incidents like that.       Intertwined with the regular movie, there are two different seriesof interviews, documentary style.  One series is done with a cheapcamcorder that produces grainy, saturated images.  I believe that theseinterviews were real.  There is also a set of made up interviews,mainly of an unnamed owner (Lou Reed) of another smoke shop.  He is atalker, a philosopher, and a long time New Yorker.  He tells us, ""I'mscared twenty-four hours a day, but not in New York.  I'm scared inSweden"" and then he goes on to explain it is because they keepbenevolently looking after his every move there.  In another of hisscenes, he says, ""Yes, I am smoking cigarettes and some of my friendshave died of them, but I am not downing a quart of Scotch in fifteenminutes.  Looked at that way, cigarettes are actually a health tool!""       One of Auggie's regulars, Bob (Jim Jarmusch), decides to give upcigarettes, but smoke his last one with Auggie.  Bob regrets having togive them up, saying that, ""Coffee and cigarettes.  That's like thebreakfast of champions.""       Keitel makes you feel good to be alive.  His smile is infectious.You want so bad to be there swapping stories.  In fact the ultimatemessage of the film has to be that the brotherhood of mankindtranscends all races.  Many scenes feature actors of one race tellinghow many people of some other race live in Brooklyn.       I have only touched on the numerous sketches in BLUE IN THE FACE.Among others, you get to see a signing telegram one with Madonna and aseduction one by the store owner's wife, Dot (played by none other thanRoseanne).  And on and on.       It is a fun time at the movies.  The sets by Kalina Ivanov arejust as imaginative and realistic as in SMOKE since they are the exactsame ones.  The costumes (Claudia Brown) are a little more outlandishthan SMOKE since I think she wanted to tease the audience a bit more.The cinematography (Adam Holender) is natural but not anything special.       BLUE IN THE FACE is edited (Maysie Hoy) crisply and runs a fast1:29.  It is rated R for a little nudity and a little bad language.Personally, I would have given it a PG-13.  It would be fine for anyteenager, and perhaps even slightly younger kids.  This is a littlemovie that I am not wild about, but did enjoy, and I can and dorecommend it to you.  It gets ** 1/2 in my book. ",Blue in the Face,R,1995,2.5
135,"What happens when Hollywood pairs one of its hottest male stars with one of the hottest pop divas, hoping to cash on the ""hot"" soundtrack as well as at the box-office? This odd combination sometimes can end as complete disaster, but sometimes it can create huge gap between snobbish critics and general audience. While the critics usually cut those films to little pieces due to their more than obvious commercial nature, general audience might (and often does) succumb to clever advertising campaigns and flock to the theatres. One of such examples is THE BODYGUARD, 1992 romantic thriller directed by Mick Jackson, film that was both immensely popular and passionately panned by the critics.   The plot of this film is based on the script by Lawrence Kasdan, originally written in 1975 with stars like Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in mind. The protagonist is Frank Farmer (played by Kevin Costner), former Secret Service agent who turned to private sector and began working as a private bodyguard for various wealthy customers. His next potential client is Rachael Marron (played by Whitney Houston), pop diva recently being targeted by mysterious but very determined and potentially dangerous stalker. Farmer reluctantly accepts the job and soon the friction arises between him and the diva. While Farmer, as professional, tries to provide the best possible protection by imposing new, tighter and often unpleasant security measures, Marron doesn't want to alter her lifestyle or jeopardise her popularity by limiting her public appearances. But this isn't the only thing that creates tensions in the relationship between Farmer and Marron - two of them soon discover that they are attracted to each other. While their relationship becomes more romantic, the stalker is getting much closer.   At first sight, THE BODYGUARD looks just like another ""high concept"" product of Hollywood - genre combination of straightforward thriller and old-fashioned romance that employs all the cliches of their respective genres. So, two lovers start their relationship by despising each other, after more than obvious red herrings identity of the chief villain is telegraphed in the middle of film, while the finale provides spectacular, but ridiculously unbelievable assassination attempt. However, THE BODYGUARD manages to work very well within those limitations, mostly due to Kasdan's script being based more on the characters than on the weak story. Relatively unknown director Mick Jackson deliberately chooses slow pace and thus allows more room for character development, as well as for Kasdan to give some of his observations on the nature of fame and celebrity in modern world. The main dramatic conflict in this film - between Farmer's desire to keep Rachael safe at any cost and Rachael's desire to stay in public spotlight at any cost - is a dilemma which is very real for many of our world's celebrities. On one hand, their livelihoods depend on the media exposure, while, on the other hand, exposure is certain to bring unwanted attention and make them targets of various dangerous individuals. Five years later with the deaths of Gianni Versace and Princess Diana, the general public became aware of the dilemma presented in this film.   The acting in THE BODYGUARD is very good. Kevin Costner, obviously aware for whom the role has been originally made, puts a lot of effort into his Steve McQueen impersonation and the result is more than impressive. Whitney Houston, on the other hand, has a somewhat easier job of playing character in many ways similar to herself and therefore doesn't have to display acting talent. The supporting cast is also good, especially Michele Lamar Richards as Rachael's sister and it is refreshing to see Mike Starr playing a nice guy for a change. The original music soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is also good, but hardly anyone will remember it, unlike Whitney Houston's songs that play throughout the whole film. Finally, the ending of the film, which is both realistic and unconventional for standard Hollywood products, leaves us with much better impression of THE BODYGUARD as entertaining little film, much better than its initial reputation.  ","Bodyguard, The",R,1992,2

They're Gen-Xers whowant the adrenaline rush of easy money. So when Seth, a 19 year-oldcollege dropout played by Giovanni Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan),realizes that his father, a judge (Ron Rivkin), has caught onto theillegal casino he's been running out of his Queens apartment, he'srecruited into the inner sanctum of a fly-by-night Long Islandbrokerage firm named J.T.

137,"      The revered director Robert Altman's films are populated with adizzying cornucopia of characters that assault your emotions.  Althoughthere are Altman aficionados who dote on his every movie, most peopleare impressed by some but bored by others.  For every brilliant SHORTCUTS, there is a confusing KANSAS CITY.       Young director Paul Thomas Anderson's much talked about filmBOOGIE NIGHTS can be viewed as a homage to Altman's style.  Set in theSan Fernando Valley in 1977-1983, the movie chronicles the life of pornfilm director Jack Horner, played in his best performance in dozens ofyears by Burt Reynolds.  Although Jack is the story's glue, most of thepicture focuses on Jack's stars and backers and on the whole pornindustry scene of sex, drugs, and violence.       ""Before you turn around, you've spent maybe 20, 25, 30 thousanddollars on a movie,"" complains Jack to his ""17-year-old piece of gold,""Eddie Adams.  Eddie, who later picks a new name of Dirk Diggler, isplayed with charismatic intensity by Mark Wahlberg.  Although Jack hasvisions of making a classy porn film where people will actually stayuntil the end, he knows his bread and butter is titillation.  Eddie,who tells himself that ""everyone is blessed with one special thing,""has just the right sized equipment to make it big in the ""adult filmindustry.""       The storyline uses the descent into hell structure.  Starting onan upbeat note, the players are all one happy family even if theirritual proclivities are certainly what most people would view asdeviant.  FARGO Academy Award nominee William H. Macy plays Jack'sassistant director, Little Bill.  Little Bill has to have a prettythick skin since his wife, played by real-life porn star Nina Hartley,has sex with other men in every place imaginable, including thedriveway, while others watch.  Macy is terrific as the hopelesslytrapped wimp of a husband.       Although one young waif ODs early on, the drug taking acceleratesas the story advances.  And as the characters begin to hit bottom, theyturn with increasing frequency to violence.  (Although different peoplewill have different levels of sensitivity, I found the most shockingaspect of the film to be the amount of drug usage.  There is morecocaine snorting in this one movie that I've seen in the last 500combined.)       Undoubtedly the praise for the movie, which many have already putit in the best picture of the year category, comes from the depth ofthe characters and the exemplary quality of the acting.  Julianne Mooreplays Jack's live-in companion and porn actress Amber Waves.  Amberapproaches her fellow actors with maternal instincts even when havingsex with them on camera.  My favorite minor character is Floyd Gondolli(Philip Baker Hall), who, like the man in THE GRADUATE, has a one wordpiece of advice to Jack about the future.  This time it's ""videotape""rather than ""plastics.""       The picture has everything in it, right down to a dance routinestraight out of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, and that is the problem.According to published reports, Anderson had only two constraints.  Hiscontract with the studio obligated him to get an R rating rather thanthe dreaded NC-17 and to bring in the picture within a two-and-a-halfhour running time.  Although he did both, the pictures suffers greatlyfrom being too long.  With fewer characters, tighter editing, and amore focused story, it would have been much more palatable andenjoyable.  At the theater I was in, the audience all looked exhaustedwhen they left.       After a devastating ending, there is a upbeat and cutesy epilogueas if to say that we should not have taken the show or its characterstoo seriously.  The movie BOOGIE NIGHTS suffers from too much promisebut not enough control.  Anderson seems to load the film up with everyidea he's ever had.  BOOGIE NIGHTS is considerably better than his lastfilm, HARD EIGHT, and I hope in his next one he uses better judgmentwhen it comes to pruning.       BOOGIE NIGHTS runs 2:32.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, violence,profanity, and massive amounts of hard drug usage.  The movie is notappropriate for teenagers. ",Boogie Nights,R,1997,3.5
138,"      A bottling plant can be a dangerous place if you're only a fewinches tall.  Stuck in a milk bottle on its way down the assembly lineto be filled, you are naturally consumed with terror.  And it doesn'thelp if you're a little boy who hates milk anyway.       For less enlightened readers, who've never read Mary Norton'snovels, a word of explanation is in order.  The world is divided in(human) beans, that's us, and Borrowers.  Borrowers are actuallyfurther divided into innies and outies, much like bellybuttons.  Inniesare those Borrowers that live inside your walls and under yourfloorboards.  Outies make their way in the more treacherous outsideworld.  You've never seen them, of course, but when a sock seems tohave disappeared from your drawer, it was probably a Borrower who tookit.       THE BORROWERS tells the story of the Clock family -- father Pod(Jim Broadbent), mother Homily, (Celia Imrie), daughter Arietty (FloraNewbigin) and son Peagreen (Tom Felton) -- who live in the walls of theLender family's house.  A perfectly cast John Goodman plays an odious,real estate developer named Ocious P. Potter, who takes possession ofthe Lender family's house through nefarious means.  To keep possessionPotter has to find and destroy the Lender aunt's will that is hidden inthe walls of their house.  This pits the Borrowers and the Lender's sonPete (Bradley Pierce) against the evil Potter and a good-spiritedexterminator named Jeff (Mark Williams), who calls himself ""the pest'spest.""       Among the film's many delights are Gemma Jackson's sets and MarieFrance's costumes, both worthy of Oscar consideration.  The world asviewed from four inches high has never been more interesting andrealistic, thanks to special effects that seem so natural.       Among the many little worlds created, the refrigerator is one ofthe best.  What are those magnets on the front for?  Why, to makeclimbing up easier.  After Arietty and Peagreen scale the Lender'srefrigerator, they use a Popsicle stick to pry open the door of thefreezer, and, once inside, the Arctic-style landscape is amazing.  Evenbetter is when they fall down the shaft carrying the ice cubes andalmost get caught when the Lenders push the ice button.  Think of thehorrors of having ice boulders being flung at your head.       The outside world looks like an English industrial town of the1930s, but the sets have a Dickensian look.  To further enrich thecomplicated time placement, Potter makes calls on his solid-gold cellphone.  All of this is filmed by John Fenner and Trevor Brooker with arust colored cinematography that gives the picture a dreamy, nostalgiclook.       The screenplay by Gavin Scott and John Kamps never makes themistake so common today in kids' movies of setting the tone too dark.This is an imaginative environment where the Borrowers creativityconstantly saves the day.       The movie teaches many a good lesson along the way.  The seriousfather, who like all of the Borrowers has a whimsically fun hairstyle,lectures his children on exactly what a Borrower is.  ""A Borrower isquiet, conscientious, and inconspicuous,"" he explains.  ""We don'tsteal; we borrow.""       For those of you who liked the idea of tiny creatures living inwalls battling a villain and an exterminator but hated MOUSE HUNT, THEBORROWERS is just picture for you.       The ending, straight out of a Brueghel painting, has a mass ofBorrowers so sweet that it may bring tears of joy to your eyes.       ""We're not vermin,"" the Borrower father tells us.  ""We're notcreeps.  And we're not pests.  We're Borrowers.""  With the courage of anoble race, he explains that, ""We may be small but heaven help anyonewho thinks he might squish us.""       THE BORROWERS runs a fast 1:23.  It is rated PG for cartoonishviolence and would be fine for kids four or five and up as well asadults with or without any kids.       My son Jeffrey, almost 9, highly recommends the movie.  Hisfavorite scenes are of the army of Borrowers and of the powered skate.His friend Steven, age 9, thought the movie was really funny.  Hisfavorite scenes were of the rocket-like skate and of the bad guygetting tied up.  Steven's twin John, obviously also 9, thought it wasa wonderful movie.  He liked the way the tiny Borrowers were able tooutsmart the beans. ","Borrowers, The",PG,1998,3.5

He ""accidentally"" meets her while trying to buycommercial real estate. Written and directed by Don Roos, BOUNCE has none of the sharply writtenedginess of his last film, THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.

140,"Stories about characters with memory loss usually make forgood drama, whether the loss explores scenes of poignancy, comedy or action.  In Christopher Nolan's ""Memento,"" GuyPearce inhabits the role of a man with short-term memory losswho tries to keep his life in order while avenging his wife'smurder.  We in the audience are challenged to guess whetherhe is himself the killer. In Bille August's ""A Song for Martin,"" anoted composer-conductor enjoying a late-life marriage isstricken with a swiftly-growing case of Alzheimer's, forcing  hiswife, a professional violinist, to  give up her career to care forhim.    ""The Bourne Identity"" is not poignant or sentimental: thrillerslike this usually aren't.  But Robert Ludlum's 500+ page book,wildly popular in its time, deals with a 33-year-old man who haslost his memory, a loss which permeates the entire story andprovides the reader (and the movie audience now) with achallenge: can you figure out what the guy was doing when hewas shot in the back three times outside Marseilles?  We findout some 2/3 of the way into the picture. If you guessed theanswer before that, you're ahead of the game.  While advancereviews should not give away the answer to The Big Question tothose who did not read the book and try mightily to figure outwhy everyone and his uncle is trying to assassinate the fellow,one thing is clear.  Be prepared to be disappointed.  Theaudience is likely to be befuddled for most of the picturebecause of the missing piece of the puzzle, while its revelationturns ""The Bourne Identity"" into a generic thriller with its carchases, machine gunning, and  martial arts exhibits that are tooedited to be believable.     If all this is true, how did the book become so popular?  Theanswer is Robert Ludlum's writing which cannot be translatedto the screen.  Look at the first page:     ""The trawler plunged into the angry swells of the dark, furioussea like an awkward animal trying desperately to break out of animpenetrable swamp. The waves rose to goliathan heights,crashing into the hull with the power of raw tonnage; the whitesprays caught in the night sky cascaded downward on the deckunder the force of the night wind. Everywhere there are thewounds of inanimate pain, wood straining against wood, ropestwisting, stretched to the breaking point.""  Ludlum is one of thegreat, contemporary, action-adventure prose stylists, but what ispowerful prose in print becomes merely prosaic on the screen.       Doug Liman's film opens in the Mediterranean on a darknight, Bourne finding himself rescued on a fishing boat,unconscious after suffering from three bullet wounds in hisback.  When he wakes up, he discovers he cannot rememberwhat he was doing to get into this position nor can he rememberhis name, but somehow he does know the number of a Swissaccount that was created for him and is surprised to find a safedeposit box filled with currency of various European and U.S.denominations and about seven passports made out in differentnames.  After a furious chase on Zurich streets (filmed inPrague) by officials who are steps behind him, he escapes in acar driven by Marie (Franka Potente), paying her $10,000 todrive her to Paris with $10,000 extra once they arrive. Littledoes Marie know that the twenty large is attached to a risk: herlife is now in danger as agents of the U.S. government (the badguys again) have pictures of Marie and Bourne together and aredetermined to gain closure over a project with extremeprejudice.     ""The Bourne Identity"" is mildly entertaining as most paranoidthrillers tend to be but while Chris Cooper gives us a nice turnas U.S. Agent Conklin--his mind made up to zap Jason Bournefor who-knows-what-reason--and while Matt Damon has thegravitas and the muscles to act his part well as the hunted-turning-hunter, the only aspect new and exciting is FrankaPotente, given a chance to move beyond her niche withexciting, original, quirky, stylized fare like ""Run Lola Run"" andenter a big, bold, blockbusting bland and ultimately pedestrianentertainment like this one. ","Bourne Identity, The",PG-13,2002,2.5
141,"2002's ""The Bourne Identity"" was an action-mystery whose commonplaceplotting was smartly offset by its studied throwback to thrillersoften seen in the '70s, where dialogue took a back-seat to tightlyconstructed visuals to tell a story. Based on the second novel inthe series by Robert Ludlum, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" approaches mattersin a similar, consistent fashion, but with one ill-advised difference„whereasamnesiac protagonist Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) had consoling companionMarie (Franka Potente) to talk to and connect with in the original,here he is almost entirely on his own. With next to no dialogue givento Jason outside of his heated phone calls and confrontations withCIA operatives, the humane core of the story has been stripped away,leaving Jason an uninteresting, undynamic bore. Two years have passed since the events of the predecessor, and JasonBourne, once a trained assassin who suffered amnesia after being shotand left for dead, is laying low in India. Still experiencing nightmaresand flashes of the past, Jason continues to try to piece togetherhis former life. That dangerous life once again comes back to haunthim when he is framed for a botched CIA operation leaving two mendead. With a CIA team, headed by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), hot onhis trail, Jason begins a cat-and-mouse game with them as he attemptsto clear his name for a crime he has no idea about. Directed by Peter Greengrass (2002's ""Bloody Sunday""), taking overfor Doug Liman, ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is a cold, calculating virtualredux of ""The Bourne Identity"" that leaves a bitter aftertaste inits wake. As Jason Bourne's journey to clear his name takes him fromIndia to Germany to Russia (an excuse for some impressive locationshooting), twists and double-crosses mount in a plot that is notablymore intricate this time around, but still strenuously by-the-numbers.Jason fights and is willing to kill anyone who gets in his way ofthe truth. The CIA team busily type away at computers, charting theirsubject's every move as they try to look experienced and no-nonsense.Occasionally there is a car chase to spice things up for the viewerswho care about nothing but generic action. People get killed, usuallythose that had it coming to them. Jason slowly learns more about himself,although not nearly enough to be of real note. Audiences have seenthis all before, many times over, and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is soreliant on its cliched narrative telling that it forgets to make them care about Jason. Matt Damon (2003's ""Stuck on You"") has no trouble slinking back intothe physically demanding, terminally conflicted role of Jason Bourne,but he struggles to recapture his soul this time around. Save forone quietly raw sequence near the end between himself and a teenagergirl (Oksana Akinshina) with ties to one of his former targets asan assassin, Damon is asked to mostly drive around, run away, andgenerally look serious. The connection to him is gone, as is his gentleromance with Marie from the first picture. Franka Potente (2001's""Blow""), who receives curious second billing, fades into the backgroundvery quickly in what is more or less a cameo appearance. This decisionalters what the film could have been enough to sabotage its outcome.Had Marie set out with Jason, at least he would have had someone to talk to. Also returning for encore performances are Brian Cox (2004's ""Troy""),his part expanded as CIA head Ward Abbott, and Julia Stiles (2004's""The Prince & Me""), again given the short thrift as Nicolette, Abbott'sgo-to girl. Stiles has a little more to do than just talk into a telephone(as she did in the original), but she frustratingly disappears quicklybefore any closure is given to her character. As Pamela Landy, JoanAllen (2004's ""The Notebook"") more or less picks up where Chris Cooper'snow-deceased character left off. She is wasted. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is captivating on occasion, thanks to a relentlessediting style by Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse that makeseven telephone exchanges and web-surfing assuredly taut. DirectorPeter Greengrass and cinematographer Oliver Wood (2003's ""Freaky Friday"")also use shaky, hand-held camerawork effectively to give viewers adocumentary essence. What these fine technical credits cannot subdueis the meanspirited, downbeat streak that runs through the centerof ""The Bourne Supremacy,"" sucking out any pleasure the experienceof watching it could have had. Everything is so excessively dark inJason Bourne's life, and there is no release to his misery in theform of a sorely lacking confidante or even a light at the end ofthe tunnel. This character was happy at the end of ""The Bourne Identity.""His story would have been better off ending right there. ","Bourne Supremacy, The",PG-13,2004,2.5

'Cause you gotta be when you see thisspoof of the movie industry in which Steve Martin plays Robert ""Bobby""Bowfinger, a down-and-out director who's crazy about a script, ""ChubbyRain,"" about tiny aliens who ride raindrops down to Earth. Problem is:the only way to get the movie made is to get a bankable A-list star -which he cannot afford. Illustrating his frustration, there's a hilariousscene in which Robert Downey Jr. is a prominent producer, ""a player,""whom he spots at a restaurant. So Bowfinger decides to stalk TinselTown'shottest actor, Kit Ramsey - that's Eddie Murphy, and surreptitiouslycapture him on celluloid, editing the surreptitious footage into hislow-budget ($2,814) movie. The angry, already paranoid Ramsey goes nutswhen he finds himself interacting with Christine Baranski and otheractors from ""Rain"" who accost him, reciting their lines. Seekingtranquillity, Ramsey retreats to a posh haven called MindHead, run bymanipulative Terence Stamp. Is this a riff on certain stars' devotionto Scientology? When he was writing the screenplay, Steve Martin originallyenvisioned a wimpy, spiritual actor, ""a Keanu Reeves type,"" but adaptedhim into a black action star with Murphy's help.  Directed by Frank Oz,Martin's elegant goofiness blends with Murphy's hip cynicism and theresult is a deliriously outrageous combination. Plus, Murphy plays anotherrole as his nerdy stunt double/errandboy. And, if you think HeatherGraham's ambitious ingenue-who-runs-off-with-a-lesbian role resemblesAnne Heche, you're not alone.

Teena Brandon - a.k.a. Brandon Teena -so desperately desired to be a boy that she posed as one. She""strapped and packed"" by flattening her breasts beneath surgicalbandages and inserting socks into the crotch of her jeans. Not onlydid she get away with the pathetic masquerade but, amazingly, sheseduced several young women who, when they questioned her sexualidentity, were told that she was a hermaphrodite. Brandon adamantlyinsisted that she was not a lesbian, explaining that she was really aboy trapped in a girl's body and often spoke of plans to have a sexchange operation. Actress Hilary Swank (TV's "" Beverly Hills 90210"")delivers an incredibly believable performance as the troubled""pretty-boy"" Brandon with Chloe Sevigny as the gullible girl whoadores her. The problem is that all of the characters are essentiallyrepugnant for one reason or another, so it's difficult to relate toany of them. (Giving a toddler beer to drink is hardly an endearingquality.)

145,"      THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER is a 1987 movie that proves you do notneed a big budget to make an animated film that is an absolute delightfor people of all ages.  A simple story, if well done with lots ofimagination, is more important than sophisticated computer generatedeffects and multimillion dollar voices.       THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER tells the story of five appliances who goin search of their beloved master.  Each one of the appliances is soadorable you will feel like filling adoption papers for them.  Thestory (Thomas M. Disch) and the directing (Jerry Rees) could not havehad better development or timing.  Only the pleasant but eminentlyforgettable songs in the film could have been better.  The music itselfis dramatic and effective.       The five main appliances are a vacuum cleaner, a baby's electricblanket, a desk lamp, an old tube radio, and an old fashioned chrometoaster.  The vacuum cleaner named Kirby (voice by Thurl Ravenscroft)is the pseudo-tough guy.   The sweet little blanket is called Blanky(voice by Timothy E.  Day).  The comic but resourceful lamp is simplyLampy (voice by Tim Stack).  The one with a radio program to play thatwill answer any predicament is known just as The Radio (voice by JonLovitz).  Finally, the star and the lest confident of all is the braveToaster (voice by Deanna Oliver).       The drawing of the characters, especially their movement, has asmuch character as the snappy and intelligent dialog, which is a bigcompliment.  Watch, for example, how Blanky slinks along and generallyreminds you of a crawling baby.  Equally imaginative is the movement ofthe lamp cord on Lampy and the antenna on The Radio.  Kirby even hasbig teeth where the dust goes in so that he can try to look tough - heis actually a gentle character.  All of the characters have big soulfuleyes that will capture your heart.       When the story opens, the appliances in an old cabin realize thatThe Master (voice by Timothy E. Day) is gone and may not be comingback.  Blanky keeps his picture under the blanket at all times.  TheMaster is a lovable looking kid with red hair, glasses and a big smile.       There is even a mean Air Conditioner (voice by Phil Hartman) witha voice that mimics Jack Nickolson's.  Before he overheats and blowsup, he complains of the others that, ""The whole bunch of you must havea combined wattage of maybe five.  It's scrap metal time.""  They worrythat with the master gone the Air Conditioner may be right so they hitupon a scheme to travel to the city to look for The Master.  This meansthey must figure out a method of transportation, a mechanism formovable power, and how to navigate through the forest.  This show isfull of good lessons for kids as they learn the value of creativity andresourcefulness plus it is a lot of fun watching their failed attemptsuntil they hit upon a successful plan.       Along the way they run into lots of trouble.  As they are crossinga waterfall, The Radio reassures them with, ""I think Houdini did thisonce, and if I remember right, he was out of the hospital in no time.""To which Lampy replies, ""Well, that's reassuring.""  Later, after theyhave another near escape from death, Lampy remarks, ""I really thoughtI'd turned in my warrantee that time.""       The Radio is an optimist and tells them, ""Things could be worseyou know.""  ""How?"" asks Lampy.  ""How what?"" says The Radio.  ""How couldthey be worse?"" asks Lampy.  ""They couldn't; I lied,"" finally confessesThe Radio.       When they find The Master's new apartment it is locked, but thisis no problem for our clever team.  The Radio informs them that,""Thanks to my war training, I will simply render the secret applianceknock, and we will be welcomed by the native machinery.""  Once insidethey are amazed at all the modern gadgets.  Lampy reflects, ""I've neverseen contraptions with so many dials and knobs before.""  To which theComputer (voice by Randy Bennett) explains, ""Naturally, we are on thecutting edge of technology.""  Here the lesson is clear, the simplerthings in life may actually be the best.  Smaller is beautiful.       From beginning to end the show is a delight.  Although I wouldgive most of the credit to the writer and director, the simple buteffective drawings add a lot.  The characters and the landscape arecarefully drawn, but never overly dramatic.  The show is full of brightprimary colors, and although there are a few evil characters in theshow, the tone and message of the show is extremely upbeat.  If youmust have the dramatic realism of THE LION KING to like an animatedfeature film, then you may be disappointed by THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER.But if the characters are the most important part of a story to you,then you may fall in love with THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER as much as Idid.       THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER runs a perfect 1:30.  It is correctlyrated G.  There is nothing to offend anyone.  There are a few imageslike an appliance being taken apart and a metal crusher at a junk yardthat might scare kids age 3 or under, but maybe not.  Certainly,Jeffrey (now 7) has loved the film for many years, and we watch itoften.  I absolutely love the show and would even if I didn't havekids.  I give it my strongest recommendation and rate it a full ****. ","Brave Little Toaster, The",NR,1987,4
146,"BREAD AND ROSES, by director Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty, whocollaborated last on MY NAME IS JOE, tells a fictional story with adocumentary feel about organizing L. A. janitors.  Two of the story's threeleads are sisters who work as non-union janitors in a typical skyscraper.One sister, Maya (Pilar Padilla), is idealistically and bravely pro-union,whereas the other, Rosa (Elpidia Carrillo), is pragmatically and just asbravely anti-union.  Both are completely believable and deliver strongperformances, but Carrillo steals the movie in a long dramatic scene towardsthe end. We see the workers verbally abused and threatened as they attempt toorganize.  Although the bosses draw most of the writer's fire forunderpaying the janitors, the leaders of the union are criticized in onescene in which the union organizer complains that the money they raise willbe thrown away like the $40,000,000 that the unions gave last year to theDemocrats. Although it is a powerful film at times, Loach makes two strategic mistakesthat significantly and needlessly detract from its message.  The first isthe casting of Adrien Brody as Sam, the paid union organizer.  Brody, a TomGreen look-alike who darts around like Harpo Marx, gives the movie a comedicside that is jarringly out of place with the rest of the drama.   The second mistake concerns the subtitles.  Since the characters wouldnaturally speak a mixture of English and Spanish, Loach keeps switching thelanguage that is being subtitled.  In theory this may sound sensible, but inpractice it is a disaster.  If you try to read the subtitles and they turnout to be in a language you don't understand, then, by the time you stopreading and start listening, you've missed the first few words of thesentence and are frequently unable to parse what is being said.  The reverseis true if you're listening carefully, only to realize that you should havebeen reading.  Since these switches may occur several times per minute, itis hard to keep track of the dialog.  If Loach felt that dual languagesubtitling were necessary, there are two ways that would have solved theproblem.  Either have both languages subtitled all of the time -- Filmsshown in multilingual countries like Switzerland do this -- or use differentcolors with, say, white for English and yellow for Spanish.   ""I believe in nothing but this,"" says Rosa, holding up her hand to hersister.  BREAD AND ROSES makes some powerful points for the union whilereminding us of everyone's believe in self-reliance.  Were it not for themiscasting of the comical Adrien Brody in a serious part and for thedistracting and constant switching of subtitles, I would have been able torecommend BREAD AND ROSES. BREAD AND ROSES runs 1:50.

147,"      Attention shoppers.  Behind this door at your local multiplex weare featuring two shows for the price of one, but not a double feature.       BREAKDOWN encompasses two competing movies.  One, a taut thrillerwill keep your attention wondering how the hero will get himself andhis wife out of their predicament.  Nothing worthy of a Hitchcock, buta substantive, even if highly derivative, mystery.       The other movie, which could go by the handle of KILLER TRUCK,believes that satisfaction comes from car chases and crashes, withmaximum highway carnage being the chief metric of success.  This partmoves surpasses the absurd on its way to the truly ridiculous.       So which part wins?  I'll tell you at the end of the review.       The movie opens with Jeff and Amy Taylor, played by Kurt Russelland Kathleen Quinlan, driving on a remote road in a desert canyon inone of the western states.  They have sold their Massachusetts home andare almost broke except for their shinny red, new Jeep Cherokee.  Theyquit their jobs and are off to find new ones just like the Howards didin LOST IN AMERICA.  The Taylors, however, run into a bit more trouble.       Their car dies in the middle of nowhere, but luckily, or perhapsunluckily, a friendly trucker named Red Barr (J. T. Walsh) passes byand offers a hand.  Jeff suggests that Amy go with Red in his18-wheeler to Billie's Dinner five miles up the road so that she cancall a tow truck.  Meanwhile, Jeff will keep an eye on their prized andonly major possession to ensure that it is not stolen.  (His cell phonehas proven useless since they are too far from a cell site.)       Jeff discovers a wire that has pulled loose so he starts the carand goes to find his wife.  The unfriendly natives at the dusty dinnercan't abide strangers asking questions, but none of them claims to haveseen Amy.  The owner's carefully worded response is that he has beenbusy and hasn't seen her, but that he cannot say for sure if she hasbeen there or not.       When Jeff drives off to go looking again, he finds Red, but Redclaims to have never seen Jeff or his wife.  The polite local cop stopsby and searches Red's truck without finding any evidence.       This is merely the setup for the mystery.  I will not discuss itfurther so as not to give anything away.  If you've seen the trailers,you already know more than I've told you.       Kurt Russell sweats and sweats as panic sets in.  His heavybreathing transmits a palpable sense of fright.  As his eyes glaze overwhile looking at a board of flyers about missing people, his fear andfeeling of helplessness engulf the screen.       Kathleen Quinlan, who received an Academy Award nomination for herpart as Marilyn Lovell in APOLLO 13, puts very little into her role inBREAKDOWN, but she gets minimum screen time.  Quinlan needs more subtleroles to bring out her talent.  Here she is wasted.       Best is J. T. Walsh as the cool, but deadly trucker.  Walsh hashad small but important assignments in a whole host of films from GOODMORNING, VIETNAM to EXECUTIVE DECISION.  He has the aura of anexplosion about to happen at any moment, even when he is completelycomposed.       The film's pacing is fast and the tension in the show mounts,thanks to the editing by Derek Brechin and Kevin Stitt.  They love toshock the audience with a quick cut from a quiet scene to the loudnoise of something bad happening.  The frequently overpowering music byBasil Poledouris keeps the film from ever being in danger of having asubtle moment.  Director Jonathan Mostow, whose only other theatricalfilm was BEVERLY HILLS BODYSNATCHERS, has talent but needs to exercisemore self-restraint when it comes to creating action sequences.       I promised to reveal which movie won.  In an ending that seemslike it will never finish, the car chase part overwhelms the mysterypart.  Watching one action cliche after another, the audience's naturalreaction to the film's conclusion has to be, ""Yeah, right!"" ",Breakdown,R,1997,2.5
148,"         A woman claiming to be my #1 fan has begged me for months to watch and review this 80's staple and, not wanting to get my ankles shattered with a sledgehammer, I decided to oblige her. She told me THE BREAKFAST CLUB was her favorite movie and she'd watched it scores of times and even reenacted the movie herself with action figures. I expected it to be good--after all, this woman has the good taste to be obsessed with my writing. Of course, it turns out I didn't like THE BREAKFAST CLUB as much as I thought I would and only gave it a two-and-a-half star rating, so I may get the sledgehammer treatment yet.          The movie works in theory--an ambitious teen comedy from John Hughes (WEIRD SCIENCE, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF) taking place almost entirely in a high school library where five completely different students are spending their Saturday in detention for one transgression or another. The concept appealed to me, as did the movie's opening, which featured voice-overs from each of the characters as they arrived for their punishment (to the background strains of an extended version of Simple Minds' ""Don't You Forget About Me""). I kept waiting for some brilliant comedy dialogue to come along, but except for a few small laughs, not too much entertainment transpired.          The characters are cut out of the basic teen stereotypes. There's the rebellious Neanderthal (Judd Nelson, who might as well be called Judd Dredd), the stuck-up ""princess"" (Molly Ringwald, entering her eighth minute of fame here), the wrestling-letter jock (Emilio Estevez), the brainy nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) and the antisocial freak (Ally Sheedy). These five people would normally never associate with each other, but the circumstances force them to get to know each other and eventually, as the laws of predictability clearly state, become friends.          Predictability reigns supreme in THE BREAKFAST CLUB without ever having any original insights to redeem it. When you have a movie that consists of 95% dialogue, the dialogue better be something good, alternatingly funny or poignant. The majority of the time, THE BREAKFAST CLUB is neither. And when the climactic moment you knew was coming finally arrives, it seems out of place. All of a sudden, the characters launch into speeches about how bad their lives are. Ringwald's got pressure from her friends, Estevez has a domineering father who's trying to regain his lost youth through his son, Nelson's home life sucks, Hall is flunking shop class and Sheedy is just plain nuts. These monologues should be dramatic or touching, but something's missing and I'm not quite sure what. The performances are all good, but something in the writing is lacking here and in the rest of the movie.          THE BREAKFAST CLUB has always been touted as one of the quintessential teen movies of the 80's and, like I said, I was expecting it to be one, but it let me down by combining a predictable plot with bad writing. It's also unnecessarily depressing at parts, with an ending that's supposed to make up for all the angst-ridden arguments. [WARNING: Don't read this part if you don't want to know the ending.] Out of nowhere, Ringwald, who has stated repeatedly how much she hates Nelson and spent the movie arguing with him, suddenly starts making out with him for no reason at all. It's almost as contrived as having Ringwald give Sheedy a makeover. Suddenly she's a _beautiful_ freak and Estevez likes her.

Writer-director Daniel Taplitz is content, instead, to paradeout an ensemble of paperweight characters as they go through the motionsof a n extensively bland plot. The film, despite offering a certainamount of gentle chemistry between romantic leads Jamie Foxx (2000's""Bait"") and Gabrielle Union (2003's ""Deliver Us from Eva""), is largelymore frustrating than swoonful because the actors are made to actbelow an average person's intelligence. Anything that could possiblycause a conflict does, as the screenplay's desperation to cook upsomething interesting exposes the film to be about as frivolous andinsubstantial as this genre gets. After being unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, Helen (BiancaLawson), Quincy Watson (Jamie Foxx) becomes so discouraged by relationshipsthat he finds himself writing ""The Breakup Handbook,"" a guide to theright and wrong ways of handling the title task that becomes an overnightbestseller. When Quincy's smooth-playing cousin, Evan (Morris Chestnut),suspects that his own girlfriend, Nicky (Gabrielle Union), is planningto break up with him, he asks Quincy to meet her at a bar and endtheir relationship for him. Through a series of»yes»misunderstandingsand mistaken identities, Quincy has no idea when he finally comesacross Nicky, who has just drastically cut her long locks, and theystrike up a connection. Meanwhile, Evan poses as Quincy in order towin the sexual favors of a gold-digger named Rita (Jennifer Esposito).Through a series of»yes»misunderstandings and mistaken identities,Nicky is crushed when she suspects Quincy has been cheating on herwith Rita. Will Quincy and Nicky solve all their problems and rekindlewhat very well could be the first stages of love? Will Evan manipulateRita enough for her to genuinely fall for him, or will she returnto her wealthy, middle-aged publisher boyfriend, Philip Gascon (PeterMacNicol), simply to get his money? And will Quincy be able to salvage his friendship with Evan when he finds out he has mistakenly stolen his girl? The question that kept coming up during ""Breakin' All the Rules"" waswhy should the viewer care about these immature, dishonest people?Quincy, Evan, Nicky, and Rita lie almost continuously to each other,sometimes for personal benefit and other times simply because thescript calls for there to be another complication. In one scene, whenQuincy and Nicky finally began telling each other the bitter truth,it was startling and refreshing. Finally, these two people were owningup to their mistakes and accepting whatever consequences such wrongfulactions might hold. Unfortunately, this newfound sophistication isshort-lived, as they regress again to insecurity and weakness. Sooften in ""Breakin' All the Rules,"" problems could be solved if onlythe characters had the emotional strength to stand up for themselves.None of them do, resulting in the viewer throwing their hands up inforfeit. How can vi ewers actively stake a claim in people's livesif the film itself doesn't treat them with the respect and intelligence they deserve? At 85 minutes, at least ""Breakin' All the Rules"" is brief, only overstayingits welcome (due to a lack of worthwhile content) by about twentyminutes or so. The cast, also, does well, but these are parts thatall of them have done so many times before that this film feels likea carbon copy. Jamie Foxx makes for a likable lead as Quincy, andGabrielle Union is lovely as always, but why would they be attractedto these parts if not solely for a paycheck? The same goes for MorrisChestnut, who has previously been a part of such interchangeable romanticcomedy fare as 1999's ""The Best Man,"" 2001's ""The Brothers,"" and 2001's""Two Can Play That Game."" Even Union appeared in the latter two features.""Breakin' All the Rules"" joins this group of forgettable and clichedtimestealers witho ut offering up anything new to set it apart fromthe crowd. ""Breakin' All the Rules"" breaks none of the rules of thegenre, and seems blissfully unaware of its own banality. Either that,or director Daniel Taplitz simply didn't care.",Breakin' All The Rules,PG-13,2004,3
150,"The expression still holds: Build a better mousetrap and theworld will beat a pathway to your door.  It doesn't really matterfor what building your metaphorical mousetrap is constructed. What's important is that the product be admired for itsoriginality.  Sales will confirm success.      Nigel Cole puts together an unusual mousetrap in Tim Firthand Juliette Towhidi's ""Calendar Girls,"" an idea that in retrospectseems such an obvious marketing ploy that if you're a woman inher fifties, you'll slap your head and say, ""Why didn't I think ofthat?""  Too late now: if you use felines instead of mousetraps ,the cat is out of the bag.  A group of women from the sticks ofEngland though pleasant sticks at that with rolling hills andtypically adorable shops in a North Yorkshire town get an ideawhose genius is overtaken only by what we urban folks woulderroneously say is its banality.  Members of a Women's Institutein this North Yorkshire town who gather regularly to hear and bebored by guest speakers' presenting topics as The History ofBroccoli when they're not getting advice on how to bake betterand darn socks with more pizzazz or competing in bake-offs,devise a scheme to raise money.  The money is not needed forselfish purposes.  When the husband (John Alderton) of AnnieClarke (Julie Walters) dies in short order of leukemia, thewomen want to present the hospital with some furniture in hismemory.  Annie and her best friend Chris Harper (Helen Mirren)devise an unusual plan, inspired by Chris's leafing through herson's girlie magazine.  Why not raise money by printing a nudecalendar, but instead of the typical playmates, the fifty-something women would themselves become January throughDecember?       After quite a bit of playing with this idea, one which wouldseem as radical in a small, southern American town as it did atfirst among the women in the Women's Institute chapter, thedozen women under Chris's leadership decide to pose nude,albeit with private parts covered by cakes or palettes or what-have-you.  They hope that the calendar sales in the regionwould raise money to provide some memorial items for thehospital.  They must overcome their own modesty, e.g. allowingthe photographer at first to set up the camera and then leavethe room, and they must get beyond the hostility of some of themen, particularly Chris's son, who is being razzed by the girls inschool, and Chris's husband, Rod (Ciaran Hinds), whoconsiders the plan immodest and foolish.     ""Calendar Girls"" is hit and miss at first, as the women titter andblush and pop their eyes at the thought of taking it all off, areaction that would seem not disingenuous but naive to anyoneto the left of the Taliban.  But as the story develops and directorCole penetrates the surface kidding around and girlie games,we find considerable friction, not only between one of thehusbands and his wife but between the two best friendsthemselves.  Ultimately, the calendar idea takes off far beyondthe wildest dream of any of the participants, and the women,giggly as pre-adolescents in a sex hygiene class, get theirfifteen minutes of fame and then some.     The film, of course, reminds us of Peter Cattaneo's ""The FullMonty,"" which in 1997 hit the bull's eye dealing with unemployedSheffield steel-mill workers who like the women in Cole'spicture need money and most of all need something of broadersignificance to do than storing jam for the winter.  Cole extractsfine ensemble acting, the interplay between Mirren and Walterscentering the story.  You don't need to be a middle-ageYorkshire resident to appreciate this: Simply approach thisstory's humor on its own level, a tale freer of cynicism than justabout anything turned out by Hollywood. ",Calendar Girls,PG-13,2003,3
151,"A summer camp for teenage misfits. First loves. Sexual identity issues.Coming-of-age experiences. And a gruff counselor/ex-Broadway writerwho needs only his singing-and-acting-obsessed students to wash hiscynicism away. Written and directed by Todd Graff, ""Camp"" probablydidn't seem like anything that special on papersimply a series ofstock characters and cliche-ridden subplots. The film is a testimony,then, of how a marginal screenplay can be miraculously transformedinto something fresh and intimate through filmed images, naturalisticperformances, and magical music numbers. That's right, ""Camp"" is notonly a coming-of-age dramedy and a camp farce, but also a zippy musicalthat often reminds of a cross between 2001's ""Hedwig and the AngryInch"" and 2002's ""Chicago."" It may not match either of those two one-of-a-kindentertainments (some of its storylines really are rather commonplace),but with energy to spare, it's not for a lack of trying. The time is now. The place is the woodsy, secluded Camp Ovation. Andfor an eclectic group of teenage drama freaks, this Broadway-themedsummer camp is what they live for throughout the other 9 months ofthe year. Ellen (Joanna Chilcoat) is so insecure outside of performing,she tried to pay her brother to take her to the prom, while buddyMichael (Robin de Jesus) was the victim of a gay bashing incidentwhen he cross-dressed for the dance. His parents don't even have itin them to come see him in one of his plays. Ellen and Michael's worldsandseveral of the other kids', for that matterare turned upside downwith the appearance of ""an honest-to-goodness straight guy,"" the angelic,eager-to-please Vlad (Daniel Letterle). Everyone, it seems, has acrush on Vlad and, in return, Vlad is happy to fulfill their wishesif it means getting attention and being liked by all. Meanwhile, snooty sexpot Jill (Alana Allen) is more than happy tohave roommate Fritzi (Anne Kendrick) act as her personal slaveuntilthe luster fades and she drops her like yesterday's news. In return,Fritzi plots revenge on Jill, intent on sabotaging her next momentin the spotlight of a stage. Others filling the rest of the centralroles include the overweight Jenna (Tiffany Taylor), whose look-obsessedfather has wired her mouth shut in an attempt to get her to lose weight;longtime camper Dee (Sasha Allen), whose voice has the strength andrange of a pro but who secretly yearns to have someone of the oppositesex interested in her; and counselor Bert (Don Dixon), who has allbut given up on his flailing Broadway career until his students teachhim to never stop reaching for his goals. With not a single cast member a veteran film actor, but with eachof them immensely talented as performers, there is an unaffected truthfulnessto each of the characters that make them seem real, as opposed toscripted. Because we have never seen them before, and because theyare so believable in what they do, we accept them in their roles.Above all, ""Camp"" excels in its performances, good enough to transcendits predictable plotting and, in some instances, overwrought dramatics.One such moment comes in the finale, when Jenna stands up before hermaterialistic parents and, through the beautiful song ""Here's WhereI Stand"" and vocals by actress Tif fany Taylor, tells them to accepther for who she is. The reaction shots of Jenna's father go overboard,exaggerating an emotion that could have been more subtly handled,but they cannot take away from the sheer beauty of the sequence. Truth be told, there isn't a weak performance in the group of leads.Daniel Letterle has the handsome, boy-next-door looks needed, buthe also has an unforeseen depth to him as Vlad, the most originalcharacter in the piece. Vlad may be straight, but that does not meanhe is exempt from doing whatever is needed to be accepted and lovedby everyone. Through his often misleading actions, Vlad remains likable,because Letterle plays him as someone who isn't purposefully malicious.Joanna Chilcoat and Robin de Jesus fulfill the two remaining rolesof a potential love triangle that may or may not ever happen. Chilcoateffectively brings out Ellen's inexperienced nature while refusingto make her seem naive, while de Jesus touchingly portrays Micha elas a young man who isn't confused with his sexuality, but is confusedby how it has changed some of the relationships in his life that matter the most. Special notice also must go to the exuberant Sasha Allen, as Dee,who has a wise and worldly quality to her face not easily forgotten.It helps that as strong as all of the young actors' voices are, SashaAllen's is the most amazing. Her opening number, ""How Shall I SeeYou Through My Tears,"" gives the film a weighty push right from the start. The best scene in ""Camp,"" set to the characters' rendition of thegorgeous song, ""Century Plant,"" symbolizes what the movie is firstand foremost about, and how it is about. When Vlad discovers an unproducedmusical piece by Bert, he and the rest of the company gather aroundto perform it together, something they refuse to stop doing even whenBert finds out what they are doing. As they continue to sing, joyfulin getting to do what they love, Bert finally heeds the lyrics ofhi s own song, that ""it's never too late to play the game."" It isone of the most powerful cinematic moments this year. From a subjective point of view, ""Camp"" is by-the-numbers and unsurprising,and its characters are types seen countless times in other films.Through the magic of song, however, the viewer learns more about thepeople than could ever been explained in spoken words. The resultis something a good deal more remarkable than it otherwise might havebeen without the music. A motion picture ideal for teenage and twentysomethingaudiences tired of the same old mainstream things, ""Camp"" is well-intentioned,full of amiable energy, and exceedingly entertaining with each passing minute.",Camp,PG-13,2003,2.5
152,"Movies, like everything else, can age. What was supposed to begreat, well-known or highly acclaimed film today could be utterlyforgotten tomorrow or, even worse, viewed as somethingmediocre. But sometimes history can play especially cruel trickswith certain titles. Even the bad ones, and the best example forthis could be found in CANADIAN BACON, 1995 comedy writtenand directed by Michael Moore, left-wing filmmaker best known forhis acclaimed documentaries and sharp criticism of Americancorporate and political establishment. This time he took satiricalapproach towards American jingoism and its connection withmilitary-industrial complex. The plot takes place after the end ofCold War, when the USA lost its adversaries and reason tomaintain large military. Loss of lucrative contracts begins to affectdefence industry and the rest of economy, which, in turns reflectsin declining poll numbers for dovish President (played by AlanAlda). In desperate need for something to distract electorate'sattention from domestic troubles he succumbs to the pressurefrom hawkish General Panzer (played by Rip Torn) and decides tomanufacture new evil empire out of neighbouring Canada. TheAmerican public is soon subjected to vicious propaganda blitz thatpaints Canadians as evil incarnate. This manifests in Niagara Fallswhere couple of citizens led by Sheriff Bud B. Boomer (played byJohn Candy) decide to take matters into their own hands, crossborder and teach pesky Canadians a lesson.  Capitalist greed as the prime cause of wars is one of the recurringthemes in the history of modern political thought. Idea that themasses could be manipulated into believing anything isn't exactlynew either. So, concept of CANADIAN BACON isn't particularlyoriginal (and was used in WAG THE DOG few years later). That,however, doesn't mean that the movie should be boring orunfunny. Unfortunately, Michael Moore showed incredibleineptness both as a writer and director. Satirical stabs in the filmare half-hearted at best and almost all jokes are unbelievablyunfunny. To make things even more incredible, the cast is made ofgreat comedians. It is especially sad to see legendary John Candyhaving one of his last appearances wasted in this failed project.The direction is equally disappointing and Moore's apparentinability to deal with anything more complicated than documentarymakes CANADIAN BACON look much cheaper than its nominalbudget would indicate.  However, CANADIAN BACON is the most disappointing when welook at it from today's context. Eight years ago, with seeminglyomnipotent USA Moore was perhaps right in blaming scruplespoliticians and greedy corporate executives for most of the evil inthis world. But today, with last year's tragic events fresh in ourmemory, viewers know that the world is much more complicatedplace and because of that CANADIAN BACON looks more patheticthan it deserves. ",Canadian Bacon,PG,1995,0.5
153," After the disastrous ""Bonfire of the Vanities"", directorBrian De Palma recovered his career by making asure-fire, more conventional film: a crime drama starringAl Pacino.  While no one will put ""Carlito's Way"" inthe same category as ""The Godfather"", it is a slightlybetter film than it has been given credit for.  Thereis much dramatic tension, the presence of Sean Pennadds pathos, and the disco-era soundtrack is good.  ""Carlito's Way"" is based on the true story of CharlieBrigante.  Brigante (Pacino) is a career criminal,released from prison in 1975.  He has a deservedreputation as a narcotics kingpin, but tries to gostraight upon his release.  He runs a disco nightclub,but inevitably events and loyalties pull him backinto criminal activity.  David Kleinfeld (Penn)is his brilliant but unstable lawyer, Penelope AnnMiller is his girlfriend, Luis Guzman is his bodyguard.John Leguizamo has a small but important part asrising gangster Benny Blanco from the Bronx.  In ""Scarface"", Pacino was a Cuban gangster.  In""Carlito's Way"", he is a Puerto Rican gangster.  (In arare moment of comedy, an Italian mobster commentsthat Pacino 'even looks Italian'.) Pacino is stonefacedthroughout, but he has an intense, world-weary coolnessthat gives him star presence.  Sean Penn is well-castfor his character, initially smug but soon decaying intoa psychopathic cokehead.  Miller is lovely but looksunhappy throughout, adding to the 'onset of doom' feelingthat permeates the film.  Penn and Miller receivedGolden Globe nomimations for their performances.  I'll always take a disco soundtrack over a John Williamsscore, but someone should have told Jellybean Benitezthat Cheryl Lynn's hit ""Got to Be Real"" was from 1979.  The best part of ""Carlito's Way"" is the dramatictension.  Pacino has to resort to gunplay on severaloccasions, and admittedly these are the best scenes. ",Carlito's Way,R,1993,2
154,"Nobody doubts that women the world over want babies.  Whether the urge isbiological or a surrender to social pressure is anybody's guess.  Not even theprolific writer-director-editor John Sayles attempts to answer the big questionin his fourteenth pic, ""Casa de los Babys,"" filmed for just one million dollarsover a period of four weeks in Acapulco, Mexico.  ""Casa"" is the tale of sixwhite women from various areas of the United States who go to an unnamed LatinAmerican country to adopt.  Since they are all staying in one hotel and have acommon purpose, they share a forced friendship.  To one degree or anotherthey're frustrated because of the residency requirement (at least two months),the red tape, the failure to understand Spanish, the culture shock.  Thepressure of being confined for so long in a place with values different fromthose up North brings out their neuroses: therein lies the interest in Sayles'sfilm, which is adapted from his own short story of the same name.     Disney assures us that it's a small world after alla concept manifest inthat a half dozen women living either hundreds or thousands of miles away fromone another in the States are brought together.  Still, the six, though allCaucasians, are such a diverse lot that you'd think they came not only from anassortment of foreign countries but from different planets.  Sayles milks thetheme of clashing mores and folkways by enclosing these folks in the samequarters... Skipper (Daryl Hannah) is a physical person, a new-age type fromColorado who jogs regularly, shuns socializing with the group, and has a sadstory to tell of tragic births.  Leslie (Lily Taylor) is nominally Jewish,works in a New York publishing firm, is single and wants a little one forreasons of her own. Jennifer (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has money, is unable to have achild, is in a shaky marriage and is the most nervous of the group since she'snot sure she even wants one.  (The actress must herself be on edge given howmany people misspell her last name, including the guy who wrote the film'sproduction notes.)   Nan (Marcia Gay Harden), the most amusing, is considered awitch by the hotel owner (Rita Moreno) because she complains incessantly andthinks nothing of giving her local lawyer hell for not speeding up the process. Gayle (Mary Steenburgen) is a recovering alcoholic who has put off parenthooduntil she can shake the habit while Eileen (Susan Lynch), is a product of aclose-knit Irish-American family in Boston who therefore knows little about howto act in foreign surroundings.       Not only does Sayles put this stew together to allow us in the audience tocatch the humor and pathos from their combined neuroses but he also gives us aflavor of the host country's own culture.  Though Sayles allegedly does notoffer stereotypes, the local people we meet do conform to our ideas about them. The frightfully poor orphans who sleep on the beach and try to make a fewcoins by selling junk or stealing purses.  The slacker son of the hotel ownerwho cavorts with his drunken friends and lambasts the ""Yanqui imperialists"" whoinfect the world ""psychologically, economically and politically.""  Theunemployed man, formerly a construction worker who plays the lottery and triesto pick up some money competing with a host of others giving tours of the town. Sayles mines pathos in one tender scene in which a hotel maid, Asuncion(Vanessa Martinez) talks of the child that she herself had to send away upNorth and who is undoubtedly having a better life while an uncomprehendingAmerican tells of her own sadness and her wish to have a baby in her arms.     One wonders why a poor Latin American country with an excess of unwantedkids would make things so difficult for the Americans, all in better financialshape than the real mothers, to take these newborns off their hands.  Butthat's another issue.  What Sayles brings across is consistent with the themesthat run through many of his other films...real truths presented withoutHollywood gloss as he shows in ""Matewan"" (a West Virginia miners' strike in the1920s), ""Eight Men Out"" (about an actual scandal involving the Chicago WhiteSox in 1919), and ""Lianna"" (the story of a lesbian affair).  Some may complainthat the writer-director is overly naturalistic, punctuating ordinaryconversations between people that you might hear in your neighborhoodsupermarket.  This may be true of his ""Lone Star,"" a series of conversationsbetween pairs of people.  For the most part ""Casa"" too is a series of talks,the six women with one another, the women with the locals, the localsthemselves expressing their desperation and frustrations.  But ""Casa de losBabys"" is so well acted, the interaction with the Latin Americans so appealing,that compelling drama emerges from what in lesser hand could have been either adull sociological tract or a glitzy, inauthentic Hollywood soap. ",Casa De Los Babys,R,2003,2.5
155,"      CASINO is a disturbing show by the great director Martin Scorsese(MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE KING OF COMEDY,GOODFELLAS, CAPE FEAR, and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE).  Scorsese is obsessedwith evil and violence.  Think of him as the Darth Vader of directors,and yet, his work is frequently brilliant.  His THE AGE OF INNOCENCEwas my second favorite movie of 1993.  (To answer your question,GETTYSBURG was number one for me that year).  Scorsese has a talent ofwhich most directors can only dream.       Like the FBI warnings on the front of video tapes, let me warn allviewers who are incapable or unwilling to see movies with extremelygraphic and arguably gratuitously violent scenes, you should pass onthis movie.  Feel free to read the review of course.  I will cover thegory aspects at the end when I discuss its ridiculous mere R rating.       We are told that CASINO is a fictional show with fictionalcharacters that was adapted from a true story.  This means the audiencehasn't a clue as to how true or realistic any of this is.  I boughtsome parts, but doubted others.  The degree of reality was not a bigissue for me in this picture.       CASINO starts in the year 1983 with Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (RobertDe Niro) being blown to bits in a mob hit in Las Vegas.  It thenflashbacks back to ten years earlier and spends the rest of the movieslowly working back to 1983.  It seems that Ace is one of the world'sbest gamblers since he does the research to make sure his bets are allsure things.  He makes so much money for the mob that they make himmanager of their Tangiers casino in Las Vegas.  He is a consummatebusinessman and turns the Tangiers into a highly efficient operationthat is a money pump for the mob.       The mob bosses stay safely in Kansas City, and they send a runneronce a week to skim money off of the top of the casino's take.  Whenthe runner comes, Ace and everyone else turn their heads.  Ace has aseries of titles at the casino to keep one step ahead of the gamingcommission, but the casino is nominally run by a puppet director of theTeamster's Union pension fund, Phillip Greene (Kevin Pollak).  It turnsout all you had to do then to work in a casino was apply for a license,actually getting one was unnecessary.  It took ten years to process theapplication, and so long as you change titles every few years, yourapplication would go to the back to the bottom of the stack thusensuring that any unsavory past and any mob connections are neverdiscovered.  This and the details of operating a casino is the bestpart of the show.  I collected tons of fun trivia about how pit bosseswork, how card cheating schemes are detected, etc.       Eventually Ace, the Albert Speer of the casino business, has hisworld complicated by the arrival of his old mob friend Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci).  Ace just wants to run a ""clean"" casino and spend his timefiguring out more innovative marketing techniques.  Nicky, on the otherhand, wants to use mayhem and murder to arrange payoffs from everyonein all of the casinos, but especially in the Tangiers.  Since Nicky isa made man, and Ace is Jewish, Nicky holds the upper hand with the mob.       To further complicate this picture, we have Sharon Stone as GingerMcKenna.  Ginger is a hooker, an alcoholic, and a heavy cocaine userwhom Ace falls in love with and marries much to the chagrin of hersleazy pimp, Lester Diamond (James Woods).       CASINO is told in a long series of narratives with all of theleads and feature actors getting their chance to tell their version ofthe story.  Actually most of the movie is told in narration that isperiodically interrupted to let the whole cast get a chance to speak.In one scene the action freezes while the actor tells why he is goingto chose to say what does.  I found this extreme narration approachintriguing, but ultimate tiring.  In fact, one of the chief problemswith CASINO is that at about three hours long, it overstays itswelcome.       The best parts of the movie are the costumes by John Dunn II andRita Ryack.  Ace wears one iridescent suit after another - orange,peach, lime green, cranberry red, salmon, chartreuse, you name it, butalways with a contrasting solid colored shirt and tie.  To complementthis, the violent Nicky sticks to dull grays and black outfits withlittle character.  I think the costume designers are a shoe-in at awardtime.  I believe they must have used Crazy Glue to attach a cigaretteto Ace's hand since he has one in every scene in the movie.  The setsby Dante Ferretti are fun too - full of solid gold rather than pinkflamingos as well as other tributes to the bad guys' bad taste.       There is no bad acting in CASINO.  Stone plays the most complexrole of her career and amazingly is pretty good at it, but I stillliked her best in BASIC INSTINCT.  Most of her movies have beenterrible, but she does have talent in addition to good looks.  De Nirois one of the best actors alive today, but I found Ace to be of hisleast interesting roles.  I got tired of Ace after a while.  Woods hasa small but well done role as a wasted loser.  Pesci was a little tooout of control for my taste, but it was a good piece of acting.       Now about that violence. In CASINO you will get to see heads withlarge holes shot into them at close range followed by blood spurtingeverywhere.  Bad guys will yank pencils out of people's hands and stabthem in the throat.  You have to endure seeing a man's hand beingsmashed with a hammer and the sounds of the bones being broken as thebloods gushes out.  In the most disturbing of all of the images, menare killed with baseball bats with the sound of large bones snappingand blood flowing everywhere, and then you get to see them buriedalive.  You can handle that?  Great, you are certified to see thisfilm.  Whether you want to or not of course is another matter.  I foundmyself watching my back in the parking lot when I left the theater; Ihad lost a little trust in my fellow man.       CASINO runs a little under three hours, but your seat will feellike it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor ThelmaSchoonmaker.  The movie is rated R by the MPAA which is is a travesty.This movies is clearly NC-17.  With the aforementioned heavy violence,heavy cocaine and alcohol abuse, sex, and constant smoking, it deservesan NC-17.  I do not think is appropriate for teenagers.  Actually, withmuch tighter editing, say an hour less movie and even if they left inall of the gore, I could recommend this movie to adult audiences withstrong stomachs.  As released, I give it a mild thumbs down and awardit **. ",Casino,R,1995,2
156,"   Along with a sure-fire Oscar nomination, Tom Hanks gets myvote for this year's REAL ""Survivor."" In this contemporary RobinsonCrusoe tale, Hanks plays a busy FedEx executive who waves good-bye tohis girl-friend , Helen Hunt, saying ""I'll be right back.""  They'vejust exchanged Christmas gifts. She gave him her grandfather's pocketwatch with her photo inside and he gave her a little, square jeweler'sbox, presumably an engagement ring. Then there's the harrowing agonyof a terrifying plane crash, and Hanks washes ashore on a tiny,deserted speck of an island in the Pacific Ocean. How will he findwater, food and shelter with nothing but the clothes he's wearing, ascavenged flashlight and the contents of FedEx boxes strewn on thebeach? Using ingenuity, he turns ice-skate blades into knives,videotape into rope, dress material into a fishing net andtriumphantly builds a fire. With his own blood, he paints a face on avolleyball and it becomes his companion named Wilson. But even moreimportant than his grueling physical and mental endurance is hismetaphysical meditation in the solitary silence and his eventualtransformation from a selfish, time-obsessed workaholic into athoughtful, mature man, fully capable, four years later, of copingwith a challenging crossroad of choices. Actor/producer Tom Hanks anddirector Robert Zemeckis, who collaborated on another Everyman journeycalled ""Forrest Gump,"" superbly craft this risky, often humorous filmand, along with writer William Broyles Jr., they are as distinguishedfor the paths not chosen, the pitfalls avoided.

""How the Grinch StoleChristmas"" was a syrupy moralistic fable, and so was its live-actionadaptation, just as ""The Cat in the Hat""the book and t he movieisfluffy, more comedic, and has a thinner storyline. The latter restraintinitially hints at doom until it becomes clear that screenwritersAlec Berg, David Mandel, and Jeff Schaffer actually invested careand energy into the proceedings, broadening the plot enough to withholdits painless 82-minute running time while still remaining faithful to its source. When working mother Joan (Kelly Preston) must rush off to her realestate job for the day, she leaves her two young children, rule-breakerConrad (Spencer Breslin) and control-freak Sally (Dakota Fanning),under the care of incessantly narcoleptic baby-sitter Ms. Kwan (AmyHill). Bored and with nothing to do (""the sun did not shine/it wastoo wet to play""), Conrad and Sally are paid an unexpected visit bythe 6-foot-tall Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers), whose one and only goalis to get them to have fun. The outlook becomes increasingly dreary,however, when the house turns to shambles. And Conrad and Sally' sfuture becomes at stake when Joan's phony, child-hating boyfriendQuinn (Alec Baldwin), who wants to send Conrad to military school,spies on the mess they've made and threatens to tell on them. Directed by Bo Welch (a production designer making his helming debut),""Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat"" is a spirited fantasy that doesn'tslow down long enough for the viewer to think about its flaws. A visionarytriumph of special effects and sparklingly colorful set designs (think""Edward Scissorhands""), the film captures the essence of Dr. Seuss'illustrations, all the while lending each shot its own flash of candy-colored,smiley-faced innovation. Especially impressive is the suburban neighborhoodof Liplapper Lane, specifically built for the film, where all thehouses are identically pink, all the cars are yellow, and the grassis the brightest shade of green the world has ever seen. And specialnote should also go to some of the most exuberantly creative alteredstudio logos in memory. As the rambunctious Cat in the Hat, Mike Myers (2002's ""Austin Powersin Goldmember"") works his comedic magic once again, playing the partwiith a chronic case of high sugar and Attention Deficit Disorder.While his non-stop charade grows a little tiresome, it is supposedto; the Cat eventually wears down the kids as the stakes grow higher.More unfortunate is his look, which is less reminiscent of a felinethan a deranged clown with the creepy cackle of Pennywise (Tim Curry)from 1990's Stephen King adaptation of ""It."" Nonetheless, Myers givesthe part his all, selling a great many one-liners, some of which aredecidedly edgy, adult, and improvised (""the dirty ho"" gag, the ""shit""reference using acronyms, the erection allusion, and even the veryname of the street they live on is one double-entendre after the next).Some parents may not appreciate having to explain a great deal totheir ch ild after the movie, but most kids will be completely delightedjust to behold its diverting sights and sounds, Speaking of sounds,the soundtrack is also of note, particularly Smashmouth's catchy coverof The Beatles' ""Getting Better"" and a part-clever/part-bizarre useof The Commodores' ""Easy""). As bickering siblings Conrad and Sally, whose differences graduallywork themselves out as the Cat works his offbeat brand of magic, SpencerBreslin (2000's ""Disney's The Kid"") and Dakota Fanning (2003's ""UptownGirls"") are charmers with a lot of chemistry with each other. Fanning,one of today's most very talented actresses of age 9, is so well-versedin comic delivery that she garners some of the movie's bigger laughs(on her meticulously planned out ""To-Do"" list, one of her plans isto ""be spontaneous,"" while another is to ""capture childhood memories"").Less on-target is Alec Baldwin (2001's ""Pearl Harbor""), a fine actorwho plays the villain of Quinn so over-the-top his every appearanceevokes nails on a chalkboard. Meanwhile, Kelly Preston (2003's ""Viewfrom the Top"") suffices nicely as Conrad and Sally's mom, while AmyHill (2002's ""Big Fat Liar"") literally sleeps her way through the part of the baby-sitter. ""Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat"" is a swirling, entertaining, ferventmotion picture that pays an affectionate tribute to Dr. Seuss' legacy.At the same time, the movie's every last second is so busy and fastthat, when director Bo Welch yearns to offer up a sweet dramatic momentor two in the second half, he botches the results. Such is the casewith the final scene between Sally and Conrad and the Cat; it i sa disappointing rush job exempt of the sort of nostalgic and humanecatharsis it deserves. Better, then, to view ""Dr. Seuss' The Cat inthe Hat"" as strictly a comedy, where it garners quite a few laughsand even a bit of charm. Had director Welch been able to slow thingsdown a notch and pay more care to his characters' burgeoning friendship,he would have likely had a new family classic on his hands, ratherthan what amounts to a disposably fun, but awfully pretty theme park attraction.","Cat In The Hat, The",PG,2003,2
158,"If you called a teenager's baggy pants ""the cat's meow"" he'dthink you were awfully uncool, and yet, ironically, the term ""cool""is itself a direct descendant of the feline expression that was allthe rage during the roaring twenties.  And how appropriate thatPeter Bogdanovich's new film is so called because ""The Cat'sMeow"" is not only a riveting recreation of one of America's mostexciting decades seen in the microcosm of William RandolphHearst's huge yacht but is a terrific showcase for some actorswho are not all that well known to Americans and yet areexquisite in their roles.  Most notable of all is the twenty-year-oldKirsten Dunst, up from comic roles in teen movies such as""Dick,"" ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" and ""Bring It On"" now performingas Marion Davies--who at the age of twenty-seven actually tookpart in the festivities on the Hearst yacht in November of 1924. Dunst is so drop dead gorgeous in this absorbing picture thatshe could wipe out the whole popularity of toga parties amongcollege guys today who would cheerfully replace them with '20'sthemes.  If the real Ms. Davies looked anything like Ms. Dunst,one could see how Orson Wells got the inspiration for ""CitizenKane,"" still considered by connoisseurs to be the greatestAmerican film of all time, in part about the romantic affairbetween Davies and Mr. Hearst.     Peter Bogdanovich is in his element a man noted for directingperiod dramas like his notable ""The Last Picture Show"" in 1971(about how characters' lives intertwine in a Texas town duringthe 1950s), and the less-than-successful ""Daisy Miller"" threeyears later (brought down by Cybill Shepherd's mediocreperformance and an altogether cold ambience),      The story is based on an actual event that took place onWilliam Randolph Hearst's yacht in November 1924, an endlessparty featuring guests who are prominent in various fields andwho join the newspaper magnate for a cruise around theCalifornia coast (with outdoor scenes actually filmed off thesouthern Peloponnesian town of Kiparissia).  Hearst, one of therichest men in the world at the time, was prominent not only inthe newspaper business and the instigator (through the newsmedia reports of brutalities)  of the Spanish-American War, buthad formed Cosmopolitan Pictures for the sole purpose ofproducing films starring the love of his life, MarionDavies whom he had met in 1917 and with whom hemaintained a long, sincere relationship marred by Hearst'swife's refusal to grant the man a divorce.       Played stunningly by Edward Hermann who looks quite a bitlike Hearst at the age of sixty-one the large, powerful mankeeps an eye on his passengers, principally Ms. Davies (KirstenDunst), but also on famed producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes),who had made his reputation producing expensive Westernsbut whose prominence had sunk of late; Louella Parsons(Jennifer Tilly), who was to become the most celebrated gossipcolumnist of her day; Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), madly inlove with Marion Davies, who is attracted in turn but refuses tochuck her relationship with Hearst; and British novelist ElinorGlyn (Joanna Lumley), the Maggie Smith of the movie whofeeds us acerbic one-liners.     Through the interaction of the personalities on deck, webecome aware of Mr. Bogdanovich's theme: Hollywood (like thecorporate world in general) is corrupt.  Sincere friendships arerare.  Individuals are out to milk one another for what they get,offering something in return that they hope will satisfy those whocan favor them with privilege, power and money.  Ince, forexample, is down on his luck and wants Hearst to merge hisstudio with Ince's and promises, in return, to keep on eye onDavies who appears to be tight with Chaplin.  Davies, ofcourse, wants to continue leading the rich life and particularly tokeep the parts coming to her from Hearst's studio though heraffection for the large man is sincere.  Parsons, who acts thebimbo for most of the tour around the California coast, wants toleave her job with a paper in New York to cover the Hollywoodscene for a Hearst paper on the West Coast.      As the group of favored persons dance frenetically toCharlestons, party and orgy the night away with the help ofbootleg booze and marijuana, a shot rings out.  A guest is shotin the head and Hearst's entire career is about to go down thetubes.  Unless...unless...     As stated, the story is based on truth.  A murder actually didtake place in that very vessel, one which was superficiallyexamined by the San Diego authorities but which the LosAngeles police department refused to investigate further. Hearst is off the hook, but a viewer of this astonishingpicture which, like Steven Peros's play on which it is based hasto wonder how the estates of some of these Hollywoodpersonalities will take it.  Did Louella Parsons really becomefamous because she manipulated Hearst into granting her alifetime job in L.A.?  Is William Randolph Hearst actually amurderer?  Did Thomas Ince, who produced the masterpiece""Civilization"" a pacifist allegory in support of President Wilson'sinternational policy sink so low that he sought Hearst's backingonly to offer his services as a private eye in return?     Whatever the fallout after the movie's April 2002 U.S.opening, the story's significance as an exposition of somefascinating cinema history may slip your mind, but you're likelynot to forget Kirsten Dunst's intense, convincing, gorgeousperformance.

159,"Mistaken identity has been a popular theme for comedies anddramas from the Romans through Shakespeare up until thepresent day.  In Fred Schepisi's 1993 movie ""Six Degrees ofSeparation"" based on the John Guare play, Paul, a charmingblack man, enters the plus Fifth Avenue apartment of FlanKittredge and his wife Oisa who are entertaining a South Africanbusinessman.  Paul claims to have been mugged.  The Kittredgestake him under their wing when Paul relates how he knows theirIvy League children and what's more passes himself off as the sonof Sidney Poitier.  Our modern society, then,  has gone way pastthe comedies of Shakespeare's plays based on exchanges ofpersonae.  With identity theft on the rise, people in developedcountries pass themselves off as owners of credit cards they'vestolen and living replicas of dead people whose social securitynumbers they've adopted.     Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the latestcinematic illustration of identity theft and while Steven Spielberg'sis not quite Shakespearean, there is such a bevy of thematicmaterial crammed into one hundred forty minutes that you mayjust wish the film were as long as ""Gangs of New York.""  A road-and-buddy pic, a coming-of-age story, a depiction of theimportance of father-son communication and a crime thriller,""Catch Me if You Can"" is the picture to catch on Christmas Day--holiday fare that's sentimental without being cloying, thrillingwithout a trace of the adolescent violence we're inundated with intheaters year after year.     The amazing thing is that the movie is based on a true story,one made into a book in 1980 by the eponymous ""me,"" Frank W.Abagnale, whose name remains the same in the movie as do thenames of all others in the case including the dogged F.B.I. agentwho tracks the young man across continents and, through aseries of phone calls he exchanges becomes a substitute dad fora seemingly self-assured yet vulnerable check forger.     The story opens with the capture of Frank W. Abagnale(Leonardo DiCaprio) by the his regular pursuer, Agent CarlHanratty (Tom Hanks), who is to arrange for the now sicklyfellow's extradition to the United States.  Spielberg flashes backto the early nineteen sixties, a time of relative innocence whendoors in many American homes remained unlocked.  Theconfidence in ourselves, the belief that our fellow Americans weregood people or at least those who dressed in Armani-style suitsand professional uniforms provide the atmosphere that allowedFrank to get away with stealing millions through a flurry of fakechecks that even the experts could not see through.     When Frank's dad, Frank W. Abagnale Sr. (ChristopherWalken) is chased by the I.R.S. and ultimately divorced by hisself-indulgent wife Paula (Nathalie Baye), the split has a profoundeffect on the sixteen-year-old high-school student, whosesuccessful pretense as a substitute teacher gives him the ideathat he can go much further.  Impersonating a Pan Am co-pilot, aphysician, and a lawyer, he is able to pass hundreds of fakechecks only partly because the clothes make the man, morebecause he possesses enough charm to acquire information,hotel rooms, flights around the world, and oodles of cash.  Leavingdozens of giggly young women in his path, he is surprised to fallin love with the orthodontically-challenged hospital candy-striper,Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), forcing him to reevaluate his lifestyle which has already gone so far out of control that he isunable to become an honest man.  His deepest relationship,strangely enough, is with the F.B.I. man who is chasing him, withwhom he communicates by phone on lonely Christmas eves andwith whom he develops a profound bond forged in part becausethe pursuer is himself a solitary fellow.     Filmed by Janusz Kaminski in a deserted prison in Montreal, asquare in Quebec City to represent a French village, in New Yorkoutside the Waldorf Astoria with some scenes on the Coast,""Catch Me If You Can"" is, like ""Butch Cassidy and the SundanceKid,"" about the sort of rogue for whom the audience will root andperhaps wonder why the French police are so angry with hisshenanigans in their country that they seem looking for an excuseto shoot him.  Involving 100 costume changes arranged bydesigner Mary Zophres, the picture shows Mr. Spielberg in yetanother role; not serious as he was in ""Schindler's List"" or""Amistad,"" or  appealing to juveniles as in ""Duel,"" but stilldelivering according to the principle ""Show them somethingthey've never seen."" If the conclusion seems cynical, if we get theimpression that crime ultimately pays, that's just fine: Spielberghas re-created a bandit whose ingenuity, charm and vulnerabilitycoupled with our feeling that no individual really appears to gethurt, gives us cause to cheer. ",Catch Me If You Can,PG-13,2002,3.5
160,"Bad press and creative controversies have plagued ""Catwoman,"" liberallybased on the DC Comics character, since shooting began. There wererumors of on-set strife and script problems. Pictures released ofthe black leather costume were vehemently derided and criticized.Early rough footage leaks on the Internet did nothing to expound mumblingsthat a cinematic dog was being made. It would be with a glad, relievedhand to write that the finished product should finally put to restall of the fan-boy naysayers' skepticism, but it won't. ""Catwoman,""if not an outright disaster, is overtly bad (and unintentionally funny)enough to become a camp classic along the lines of 1995's ""Showgirls."" Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a mousy hard-worker at a pretentiouscosmetic company constantly trying to please her boss, George Hedare(Lambert Wilson), and his wilting supermodel wife, Laurel (SharonStone), while letting everyone walk all over her. While stopping atthe company headquarters late at night to drop off her latest project,she overhears George discussing the adverse effects an anti-agingcream about to be released on the market will have on its consumers.Patience is caught and promptly killed to silence the company's secret,only to be resurrected with the help of a cat's life-force. Now giftedwith a cat's heightened senses and capabilities, Patience must cometo terms with her old self and new, sexy, unafraid alter ego, whilesetting out to seek revenge on those responsible for her death. Meanwhile,police detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) is smitten by Patience,even as he also grows oddly attracted to the mysterious figure heis hunting down: Catwoman. In the annals of big-budget comic book adaptations, ""Catwoman"" placesnear the bottom of the list, both in quality and inspiration. Directedby one-named first-timer Pitof and written by John Brancato & MichaelFerris (2003's ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"") and John Rogers(2003's ""The Core""), the end results signal a wide divergence of half-bakedideas that don't fuse into a complete whole. The story is impossibleto take seriously because the ham-fisted personalities of the charactersand their stagy actions range from sullen to wisecracking to horrendouslyover-the-top, cause for some laughs that aren't intended and stonesilence when it is trying to be funny. Alex Borstein (2003's ""The Lizzie Maguire Movie""), so funny on ""MadTV"" as skit character Miss Swan, sticks out like a sore thumb, spittingout one mortifying one-liner after the next as Patience's co-workerfriend, Sally. Borstein acts as if she is in an entirely differentmovie, altogether. On the other end of the spectrum, Sharon Stone(2003's ""Cold Creek Manor"") seems to have resigned to the fact thatshe is stuck in a hopeless, thankless project and chews the sceneryaccordingly. As icy villainess Laurel, Stone is a laughing-stock forall the wrong reasons; her overly dramatic reaction at one key moment,despite intentionally being a put-on, could put a shudder of embarrassmentdown the spine of a blind audience member. For an action-oriented thrill ride, ""Catwoman"" is glaringly stunted.The fight sequence, although energetically choreographed, are strictlyof the kick-and-punch-and-jump variety, and the movie's misguidedidea for an elaborate, death-defying set-piece is a malfunctioningferris wheel, the bolts to one of the carriages loosening as a youngchild cries for help. There is nary a single suspenseful or excitingmoment during any of it, especially shameful when comparing the pictureto the grandly entertaining, rousing ""Spider-Man 2."" Viewers walkinginto ""Catwoman"" won't get what they are looking for in terms of thrills,but they will be blindsided by what they do get„a lame, cue-the-cutesy-musical-stringsromance between Patience and Tom that is almost treated like the centralstoryline, and a mindboggling basketball-playing montage dropped intothe second act that plays like a discarded idea for an R&B mu sic video. Halle Berry (2003's ""Gothika"") is quickly falling victim to the supporting-actressOscar winners curse; like Marisa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, and AngelinaJolie before her, Berry is a spectacularly talented performer (herstaggering work in 2001's ""Monster's Ball"" proves it) in danger ofdropping off the prestige radar if she continues picking lazy, throwawayprojects. As the timid Patience Phillips, Berry is unconvincing andfails to charm her way into the viewer's heart the way she shouldin order to make her transformation affecting. She is better as thespicy, vicious Catwoman, perfecting the movements and actions of acat-like creature. Her physical performance is top-notch; her emotionalone is barely adequate. When all is said and done, Berry is a deficientsubstitute for Michelle Pfeiffer, who was brilliant and layered inthe role in 1992 's ""Batman Returns."" Is there anything worth positively noting about ""Catwoman?"" Yes, butthe list is sparse. The cinematography by Thierry Arbogast (2002's""Femme Fatale"") is sumptuously imaginative, filled with swooping cranemovements, sweeping establishing shots, and some ingenious cameratrickery. The scenes in which Catwoman climbs and jumps buildingsare inspired, featuring convincing visual effects that rarely looklike computer-generated images. Finally, the occasional glimpses intothe history of cats and their folklore are undernourished, but potentially fascinating. As the first in what is hoped to become a new comic book film series,the amateurish outcome of ""Catwoman"" will likely kill the franchisebefore it has time to sequelize. In a silly, lowered frame of mind,however, the film may just gain a small following with drinking gameaficionados. If they take a shot every time they spot something sodim-witted and outrageously misdirected they can barely believe theireyes, they'll be drunk and having a great time before the slinky Catwomaneven makes her first appearance. ",Catwoman,PG-13,2004,1.5
161,"In an acting tour de force in THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE, Samuel L. Jacksonplays Romulus Ledbetter, a paranoid schizophrenic with dirty dreadlocks andstandard homeless attire.  Romulus, however, is careful to correct people.He isn't a homeless person but a cave dweller.  In his cave in a publicpark, he watches TV without having to plug in any wires.  Wherever he walks,there are evil signals coming his way from the top of the nefarious, artdeco Chrysler Building in New York.  The yellow-colored Y rays aretolerable, but the new green-colored Z rays are pretty sinister. So what is the story about?  It's a murder mystery with Romulus as a blendof the lead characters of SHINE, ""Columbo,"" and THE FISHER KING.  AJulliard-trained, classical pianist, Romulus is a highly intelligent andgifted man who has lost his sanity but not his mind.  Jackson avoids all ofthe pitfalls of such a role, delivering a performance that makes Romulus acomplex character who deserves our sympathy and our understanding. Being, well, nuts, no one will pay attention to Romulus when he claims thatthe guy found frozen in a tree near his cave was murdered.  He suspectscontroversial artist David Leppenraub (Colm Feore) since the murdered youngman was one of Leppenraub's models.  Leppenraub is fond of makinginflammatory remarks about his art.  (""All great art is born of suffering.""and ""If the price of rapture is a mountain of suffering, shouldn't the feebe paid?"") Director Kasi Lemmons, whose only other film was the acclaimed EVE'S BAYOU,has an acute sense of the visual.  Romulus's many surrealist dream sequencesare particularly compelling, giving us an enhanced awareness of his pain. My favorite subtheme in the story involves a bankruptcy lawyer named Bob,played with a boyish innocence by Anthony Michael Hall, who provides Romuluswith a suit and a shower.  Bob's apartment is furnished completely in 1930sdecor since that was the ""golden era"" for his profession. THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE doesn't quite fit into any category.  It's a fairlythin mystery but a heck of a character study.  Whatever it is, it keeps youreyes glued to the screen from beginning to end.  Without Jackson to play thecentral role, the production would have been hopeless.  But he did agree toplay it and made it, thereby, a handsome addition to the Jackson collection. THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE runs 1:43.  It is rated R for language, someviolence and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.","Caveman's Valentine, The",R,2001,3
162," Woody Allen, one of the most celebrated and acclaimed modern-day directors, has, in recent years, experimented with different types of films, straying from his regular New York comedy-dramas. 1994's ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" was a period piece set in the 1940's; 1995's ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" was a modern day Greek interpretation; 1996's ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" was a magical return to the musical genre; and 1997's ""Deconstructing Harry,"" was a deliberately graphic and offensive comedy.   Woody Allen's new film, ""Celebrity,"" is perhaps his strongest picture since 1992's ""Husbands and Wives,"" a winning and often hilarious comedy that delves into the lives of the rich, the famous, and the struggling.The film follows its main character, Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh), a journalist, around throughout one year, as he has interesting run-ins with some of Hollywood's most powerful celebrities, all the while searching for true love. He recently has gotten a divorce from his wife of sixteen years, Robin (Judy Davis), who was devastated to find out he had been having an affair. Many of the people he encounters include a blonde bombshell actress (Melanie Griffith), who gives him a tour of her small childhood home; a supermodel (Charlize Theron), who is multi-orgasmic and gets off on simply being touched anywhere on her body; a popular teen hunk (Leonardo DiCaprio), who trashes a hotel room and beats his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol), all the while telling her that he loves her; and a kind live-in lover (Famke Janssen). While all of these people come and go through Lee's life, the woman he seems most right for is Nola (Winona Ryder), a waitress and struggling actress, despite their age difference. Meanwhile, the unhappy Robin, to her astonishment, meets a man (Joe Mantegna) in the talk show arena whom falls in love with her and gives her her first big break in showbiz, a profession she had never expected to go into.   One of the problems that last year's ""Deconstructing Harry,"" ran into was that it had such a large cast that everyone ultimately felt criminally wasted. I was fearing the same fate for, ""Celebrity,"" but all of the characters are infinitely more well-handled, and the story and screenplay feel far more assured and satisfying.   One of the qualities of, ""Celebrity,"" which is very appropriate, is the dream-like black & white cinematography that constantly reminded me of films from the 1930's and 40's. The way that the story drifts from one character vignette to the next was entertaining to watch because I was enthralled by every single one of the characters, and couldn't wait to see who Lee would meet next.  As in all of Allen's films, he has recruited a wonderful, large cast. Kenneth Branagh, obviously doing an Allen impersonation, is convincing as the central character, and Judy Davis gives a touching performance as Robin, a woman who has been so unhappy for so long that she can't really believe the happiness she feels when she meets Mantegna. Charlize Theron is, to say the least, bewitching as an uninhibited supermodel; Bebe Neuwirth, as a hooker, has a hilarious scene with Davis where she teaches her how to have oral sex with a banana; and Leonardo DiCaprio is annoying, but plays the rebellious, out-of-control teen superstar to a T. Finally, and perhaps giving the best performance is Winona Ryder, who brings so much life and spark to her scenes that I feared the film might burn up in the projector. One particular sequence set at a party where Branagh and Ryder are trying to talk amidst the various conversations around them is fabulously developed and shot.  Although set amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, what, ""Celebrity,"" is really about is the things that people desperately long for in order to be happy. Lee only wants to find love, but has several character flaws that he needs to get over first, and Robin is so used to not being appreciated that when she finally feels wanted, she doesn't know how to react to it. The final sequence of the film, in which Lee and Robin meet up at a film premiere and are able to talk rationally for the first time since their divorce, is especially powerful, and the last shot, which circles around to the opening shot, is an alternately clever and thought-provoking image that I think says quite a lot. ",Celebrity,R,1998,2.5
163,"Following a fairly disappointing summer, where every movie seemed to be a cliched take-off of a film already made, acclaimed music video director Tarsem Singh's ""The Cell"" is a visionary masterpiece, not quite like anything you've ever seen before, nor will likely ever see again. A disturbing, evocative journey into the human mind, the film recalls your spookiest dreams, most forbidden fantasies, and darkest past memories, strung together in an unforgettably bold visual palette. That such a creative and bizarre motion picture was made at all is relatively surprising. That such a creative and bizarre motion picture was made in the big-budget world of mainstream Hollywood is nearly a miracle. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a hard-working, sympathetic child therapist who, for seven years, has been working for Dr. Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), the head of a top-flight institution and the creator of the Synaptic Transfer System, which allows a person to literally go into the subject's mind. Recently, Catherine has been working with a comatose young boy named Edward (Colton James), attempting to bring him back into reality, but the process of directly connecting with him is proving time-consuming and frustrating. Meanwhile, the body count has risen once again with the discovery of the eighth body of a woman, found in a lake and bleached completely white, made to look like a porcelain doll. The schizophrenic killer is Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), who seeks pleasure in kidnapping women, locking them up in a small Plexiglas room for 40 hours, and then flooding the room completely with water. What he does next, including suspending himself above his victims by fourteen metal rings deeply pierced into his body, is best left unsaid. His latest potential victim is Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff), who has gone missing from the area and has forty hours to be found before she drowns. Worst of all is that Carl Stargher has just lapsed into a coma, preventing him from being able to tell anyone where Julia is located.  Enter FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), whose only hope of saving Julia's life is persuading Catherine to go into Carl's mind. While the chance of success for such short notice is slim, Catherine agrees, not knowing what severely twisted things lie within the mind of such a pathological, mentally unhinged person. A creepy horror-thriller with large helpings of fantastical imagery, ""The Cell"" puts a fresh spin on the tiresome Serial Killer genre by not only being about saving the latest victim in jeopardy, but also focuses on the inner-workings of a sick mind. A thought-provoking triumph, the film is possibly one of the most visually imaginative films ever put to celluloid, aided by director Singh, screenwriter Mark Protosevich, and, arguably the star of the picture, cinematographer Paul Laufer. Using jump cuts, slow motion, fast motion, upside-down and sideways shots, and many more stylish techniques, Singh and Laufer have created an entirely new world, one that is as beautiful and awe-inspiring as it is threatening and nightmarish. If Tarsem Singh ever had a blueprint to model ""The Cell"" after, his original film source would clearly be Luis Bunuel's mesmerizing ""Un Chien Andalou,"" in which every grotesque moment was a powerful metaphor for the unfortunate toll that schizophrenia had taken on a person. Carl, whose mind portrays his adult self as a powerful ruler who delights in the torture of all creatures that find their way into his lair, also has created a version of himself as a frightened child (Jake Thomas) whose father physically and verbally abuses him. Catherine quickly realizes that the only possible way to get through to Stargher and find out where Julia is is to warm up to the child in him, whom she grows to deeply feel for under the discouraging circumstances. The beautiful Jennifer Lopez (1998's ""Out of Sight""), who has gained added popularity in the past two years from her debut pop album, ""On the 6,"" should be applauded for taking on such an undoubtedly daunting project as this. Lopez appropriately underplays the role of Catherine, who sympathizes with the abused Carl and seems to connect with him due to something unmentioned from her own past. While more development could have been done with her character (the thinly written roles are the picture's sole sore spot), Lopez brings much-needed maturity and subtlety to Catherine, and believably portrays a therapist. Vincent D'Onofrio is both menacing and poignant as the ill Carl Stargher, and like Lopez, gets to take on many different role and costume changes, depending on what his mind does with him. The film calls for him to be psychotic and frightening at certain points, and lonely and scared at others, and D'Onofrio pulls it off. Vince Vaughn is professional, if unextraordinary, as Peter Novak, and does exactly what is required of the role, and not much more. Featured in supporting roles are Marianne Jean-Baptiste (1996's ""Secrets & Lies"") and Dylan Baker (1998's ""Happiness""), as the two scientists who head the project of synaptic transfer; Jake Weber, as Peter's partner, Gordon Ramsey; and Tara Subkoff, who manages to be powerful in only a few small scenes, as Carl's last victim, Julia Hickson. A genuinely rewarding and surprisingly touching experience, ""The Cell"" is a one-of-a-kind motion picture that is not only a feast for the eyes and ears (the music score, by Howard Shore, is erratically memorable), but also works up and lays bare emotions that are rarely felt in films nowadays. That ""The Cell"" is a visually astounding work of art, as well as satisfying on a story basis is cause for celebration, and director Tarsem Singh deserves all the praise one could possibly get for making a debut feature as strong as this one.","Cell, The",R,2000,3
164,"It was only a matter of time before a motion picture took the cellphone technology and all of its capabilities and pitfalls and createdan entire story revolving around it. The surprise is that it tookso long. Directed with savvy gusto by David R. Ellis (2003's ""FinalDestination 2""), ""Cellular"" is a taut, crowd-pleasing thriller inwhich the improbable, if canny, premise is overlooked in exchangefor what is an exceedingly fun ride. Think of the film as a crossbetween 1994's ""Speed""„with a cell phone standing in for a bus„and2003's ""Phone Booth,"" coincidentally written by Larry Cohen, who getsthe ""story"" credit here, and you will have a pretty solid idea of what to expect. Ryan (Chris Evans) is the kind of handsome slacker who spends mostof his days at the beach, unreliable to those around him but coastingby on charm. When he receives a call on his cell phone from a womannamed Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger), who earnestly tells him she hasbeen kidnapped and is holed up in an unknown location, his naturalfirst impression is that she is a prank caller. After pleading hercase to him„she has managed, by chance, to make a random call on ashattered telephone and he is her only hope for savior„Ryan changeshis mind. Having no luck at the police station, Ryan is suddenly thrustinto a long, dangerous day of trying to find out where Jessica is,thwart her captors, headed by Greer (Jason Statham), and keep alivetheir phone connection with each other. If the battery runs out, orthe call is lost, Jessica and her family are as good as dead. The story of a care-free young man who is forced to grow up and takeon the responsibility of saving the life of a total stranger, ""Cellular""doesn't offer much more depth in Ryan than that, but there is hardlytime for character depth in a film, and hero, that has nary a secondto sit down and take a breather. The movie, slim as it may be andas contrived as the setup is, enthralls the viewer from the very beginningand doesn't stop piling on one innovative predicament after the nextfor Ryan to face until its 90-minute running time is over. The screenplay by Chris Morgan appreciably plays by the rules, notstraining the boundaries of one's disbelief on how a cell phone worksand what it can and cannot do. Ryan can't drive into any tunnels,the call threatens to break up in stairwells, and it is only so longbefore his cell gets low on battery. There is further tongue-in-cheekhumor throughout that strikes some common truths about the world welive in without getting too silly for its own good. While rushingthrough slow L.A. traffic, Ryan„on the phone with Jessica„yells atanother driver to get off their cell and concentrate on the road.Later, he becomes frustrated when, wouldn't you know it, he gets stuckbehind a big truck, blocking his view of the kidnappers' car thathe is following. In another scene, while Ryan is stopped at a redlight, the beats of rap music move closer until a middle-aged whitewoman pulls up next to him, her loud radio threatening to give Jessica'ssecretive call away to Greer on the other end of the line. As Ryan, this could be Chris Evan's (2004's ""The Perfect Score"") star-makingperformance. He is likable, commands the screen with no other propor character to work off of other than his phone, and is just awkwardenough in some of his intense run-in's with the public to make believablethat this is a guy who has never broken the law before or raised hisvoice to get what he wants. As the distraught Jessica, Kim Basinger(2004's ""The Door in the Floor"") does excellent with an emotionallydemanding role, keying vividly into the pure terror and desperationof a woman facing life-threatening circumstances. And, along the way,Evans and Basinger form a tight-knit bond without ever meeting face-to-faceuntil the climax. William H. Macy (2003's ""The Cooler"") is strongin a quirky supporting role as police officer Mooney, who begins toinvestigate Jessica's whereabouts on a hunch following his cut-shortconversation with Ryan. As ""Cellular"" speeds toward its conclusions, a few plot threads areleft to unsatisfying closure, including the particulars surroundinga key event that led to the kidnappers' motives and Ryan's rocky relationshipwith ex-girlfriend Chloe (Jessica Biel). More time could have alsobeen afforded to Jessica's also-in-danger husband (Richard Burgi)and son (Adam Taylor Gordon). These problematic areas, however, don'tleave more than a cursory impression on the viewer because, fundamentally,the film is but a plot-driven, action-laden thriller out to entertainas wide of an audience as possible. ""Cellular"" achieves this goal,bringing suspense and ingenuity into the equation when so few moviesin the genre barely seem to try at all. ",Cellular,PG-13,2004,2.5
165,"Think ""Fame"" meets ""The Turning Point"" or ""The Red Shoes"" andyou have the concept of this backstage story set at Lincoln Center'sprestigious and, at times, pretentious American BalletTheater. Directed by Nicholas Hytner (""The Madness of King George,""""The Crucible""), it's filled with enthusiasm and good intentions,offering a glimpse into the demanding world of ballet, complete withbruises and bandages.  Amanda Schull stars as a beautiful, blue-eyedblond with ""bad feet"" who temporarily pirouettes into the affectionsof Ethan Stiefel, a principal dancer with the ABT who could be thenext Mikhail Barishnikov. They're surrounded by stereotypical ""AChorus Line""-types - the bulimic prodigy (Susan May Pratt) with apushy mother (Debra Monk), the edgy rebel (Zoe Saldana) with a badattitude, the best-friend (Shakiem Evans), the romantic (SaschaRadetsky), the Russian (ice-skating champion Ilia Kulik) and facultymembers (Peter Gallagher, Donna Murphy). It's all very familiar: thereare six spots in the company to be filled - who will get them? And thescreenplay by Carol Heikkinen (""The Thing Called Love,"" ""EmpireRecords"") is corny, filled to the brim with cliches. It's hard not tochuckle at: ""I'm not dancing for them anymore - I'm dancing for me.""Make no mistake: this no ""Dirty Dancing"" or ""Flashdance."" Yet there'saerobic jazz and salsa, as well as the classic tradition ofTchiakovsky and Prokofiev. To me, the highlights were Stiefel'sperforming ""Stars and Stripes,"" choreographed by George Balanchine,and the hip finale, set to the rock music of MichaelJackson. Basically, this is TV fare that will probably be far moresatisfying on video. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""CenterStage"" is a graceful 4. But it's the dancing that scores, not thedrama. ",Center Stage,PG-13,2000,2
166,"      For those of you who truly believe that Elvis is still alive, Ihave a picture that you will find plausible, CHAIN REACTION.  For therest of us, we will have to enjoy the film for the action alone.       Just so you can get a feel for how much you will have to suspenddisbelief, try a few of these on for size.  Eddie Kasalivich (KeanuReeves) is just a student machinist, but at home by himself he comes upwith the key breakthrough on the most important scientific invention ofat least the Twentieth Century.  With a single glass of water thescientists are able to unleash enough energy literally to power theentire city of Chicago for a whole month.  Not only is the energy ofcolossal power, it is also free.       In the silliest notion of all, if this free energy technology isgiven to the world we learn that all of the stock markets and all ofthe world's economies will immediately collapse because companiesdepend on making money off of energy.  Think about this one for aminute.  With the exception of the energy companies, all of the othercompanies would have fantastically profitable years since a key part oftheir cost structure would vanish.  The stock markets would have thebiggest bull market they have ever seen.       At any rate, we learn all of this crazy pop science in the firstfew minutes, and then is on to the heart of the show.  The lab whereEddie, Dr. Lily Sinclair (Rachel Weisz), and others work is blown up.The special effects are terrific.  Although it is not a nuclearexplosion, it looks like one.       The only people not killed in the blast are Eddie and Lily.Someone sets them up to look like they are who set up the explosion.The show is about who actually did the bombing and who is trying tosteal the free energy.  I would like to reveal the groups involved inthe bombing so I could rant and rave about how ridiculous it is, but Iwill resist.  The movie's conclusion is not only tedious - it is stupidas well.       The best part of the movie is that it has Morgan Freeman in it assuper-rich and highly mysterious Paul Shannon.  Shannon has beengetting billions of dollars over the years from the congress, the CIA,most major industries, etc., but no one seems to know anything about itsince it is all top secret.  Yes, that old credibility problem again.The good news is Freeman gets to speak some.  The bad news is that thewriters (Michael Bortman and J. F. Lawton based on a story by JoshFriedman, Arne Schmidt, and Rick Seaman) have Freeman spend most of thetime just twirling a cigar in his mouth and saying nothing.       Beside the impressive special effects (Nick Davis), thecinematography (Frank Tidy) is awesome.  Watch how the editors (DonaldBrochu, Dov Hoenig, and Arthur Schmidt) cut between shots of cold, graysnow at night to pictures of the power of the energy in the lab.  Themusic (Jerry Goldsmith) is far from subtle.  Most scenes have the hornsblaring just to remind you of how much danger our heroes are in.       One key piece of special effects is absurd.  The machine they useto produce the energy looks like it came from a 1930s science fictionmovie.  Imagine a large washing machine with glass sides that shakeslike crazy, and that has a few dryer hoses coming out of it that appearto be about to come unconnected and spill water everywhere.  Behind itput a large oven with big open flames.  Make it all constantly justabout to blow like an overheated boiler on a sternwheeler.  Trust me;it is actually even less believable than my description.       The director for CHAIN REACTION is Andrew Davis.  His specialty ismovies with lots of violence and heavy special effects components.These include: ABOVE THE LAW, UNDER SIEGE, and THE FUGITIVE.  Thismovie is not near as good as any of these successful past efforts.  Healso made other films that I have not seen which were perhaps as bad asthis one.  He sets way too serious a tone for such a ridiculous show asCHAIN REACTION.  A little humor would have helped immensely.       Although Reeves delivers an acceptable performance, the same cannot be said of his sidekick.  Relative newcomer Weisz, who has a smallpart in STEALING BEAUTY, plays the woman in danger role with littleintelligence and not much emotion.  It is hard to believe that she iseither super smart or super scared as she should be based on the plot.Weisz seems mainly oblivious to the world.  If she has any talent, itis not in evidence in this movie nor is it in STEALING BEAUTY.  A nicesmall good performance is given by ever reliable Fred Ward as FBI AgentLeon Ford.  In another small role Brian Cox overacts as unbelievablebad guy Lyman Earl Collier.       CHAIN REACTION runs 1:46.  It is rated PG-13 for gobs ofnon-graphic violence.  There is no sex or nudity, and I did not catchany bad language.  The film would be fine for any kid over say 10.  Ido no recommend the show, but if you go, you'll probably enjoy thestunts and the action.",Chain Reaction,PG-13,1996,1.5
167,"Here is a film in which its theatrical trailer does not even comeclose to doing justice to the surprisingly mature, thought-provokingtreatment the story gets. As the ads suggest, ""Changing Lanes,"" directedby Roger Michell (1999's ""Notting Hill""), does include aspects ofa Hollywood-style thriller, but to label it as such would be to cheapenthe truthful emotional impact the film holds. Set almost entirely on Good Friday, Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is ahigh-powered Manhattan lawyer who unknowingly has sold his soul inexchange for a rising bank account. On his way to the courthouse topresent an original legal document that will save his career, andthe law firm he works for, from jeopardy, he is involved in a fender-benderon the FDR with recovering alcoholic Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson).In too much of a rush to exchange insurance with Doyle, Gavin leaveshim stranded on the road with a flat tire. His radical behavior notonly costs Doyle, who was also headed for a court date, joint custodyof his two young children, but Gavin realizes upon arrival that hemust have accidentally left the required document with Doyle. Givenan ultimatum of presenting the file to the court or risking jail time,tensions escalate with Gavin determined to get back his file fromDoyle, and Doyle determined to teach Gavin a lesson about common human decency. It is easy to see how such a story could have been transformed intoan exploitive, cliched mainstream thriller had the wrong hands gottenhold of it. Under the watchful eyes of director Michell and intelligentscreenwriters Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin (1998's ""Deep Impact""),however, ""Changing Lanes"" is first and foremost a provocative studyof the human condition. While thoroughly arresting throughout, themakers wisely shift the focus away from action set-pieces (there arevery few to be found) and toward aspects that should always been anecessity, but rarely are, such as character development and powerful underlying themes. The redemption Gavin Banek goes through as the film unfolds is oneof its most indelible elements. Seen as a narrow-minded money-grubberat the beginning, Good Friday for Gavin turns into a life-changingday that eventually brings him to opening his eyes to the person hehas become, and being appalled by what it sees. When Gavin admitsto his senior partner and father-in-law (Sydney Pollock) that he haslost the file required to get the firm out of hot water, Pollock demandsthat he forge a replica and hand it in. The moral implications ofsuch, intermixed with the corruption involved in working at the lawfirm and Gavin's transformation, are handled in a fully challengingway that never once talks down to the viewer. Doyle Gipson is just as fascinating a character as Gavin. At heart,Doyle is a father who almost seems like a little kid himself. Battlingthe demons of alcohol addiction and the possibility of having hissons permanently taken away from him, Doyle is an inherently goodperson who can never seem to have anything good happen in his life.He is a man at the end of his rope who is coming progressively close to snapping. Ben Affleck (2001's ""Pearl Harbor"") has never had a role with suchdepth and maturation as Gavin has. Affleck, too often overlooked forhis good looks, is captivating from start to finish, seemingly bearingthe darkest reaches of his soul to do full justice to the character.Every note he plays is key-perfect, including one scene set in a churchconfessional, and a climactic one in which he faces off with his wife(Amanda Peet) and father-in-law after deciding, once and for all,the difference between right and wrong.  As Doyle, Samuel L. Jackson (2000's ""Shaft"") is remarkably touchingin a part far from his usual roles. Whereas Jackson usually playscharacters with big personalities and showy demeanors, here he isasked to portray someone who is quietly imploding both on the insideand out. Like Affleck, Jackson doesn't take a wrong step in bringingDoyle to life. Credit director Michell for opting to not present eitherlead as a villain, but both as alternately sympathetic and flawed human beings. The supporting cast is exceptional, each one making an impressionno matter how small the screentime. Sydney Pollack (1999's ""Eyes WideShut"") and William Hurt (2001's ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence""),as Doyle's concerned AA representative, give memorable turns as, inessence, Gavin and Doyle's father figures. After just criticizingher loopy role and acting in ""High Crimes,"" Amanda Peet has managedto do a 180-degree turn to deliver a focused and poignant performanceas Cynthia Banek, Gavin's wife, who finally discloses why she reallymarried him. As Doyle's long-suffering wife, Kim Staunton (2002's""Dragonfly"") is heartbreakingly real. And finally, Toni Collette (1999's""The Sixth Sense"") brings unpredictable layers to the potentiallyunderwritten role of Gavin's assistant and sometimes-mistress, Michelle. As ""Changing Lanes"" moves sure-footedly toward its finale, it doesnot falter or cheat, as so many movies of its ilk usually do. Instead,the characters and their realistic predicaments are left to work themselvesout, for better or worse. By the time the film's last two affectingscenes arrive--one set at dinner between Gavin and his in-laws, andthe other played to Annie Lennox's gorgeous song, ""Waiting in Vain""--itcame as something of a shock how much Affleck and Jackson, along withdirector Michell's aid, had gotten me to deeply feel for Gavin andDoyle, and the movie they were in. ""Changing Lanes"" is one of thebest motion pictures of the year.",Changing Lanes,R,2002,3
168,"They're back!  Those three fearsome crime fighters who work for anonymousmillionaire Charlie Townsend (voice of John Forsythe), a.k.a. Charlie'sAngels, are back in their big screen debut.  Perfectly cast with CameronDiaz as Natalie, Drew Barrymore as Dylan, Lucy Liu as Alex, and Bill Murrayas Charlie's faithful lieutenant, Bosley, the movie takes us on ahigh-energy ride that is pure campy fun. In his feature film debut, music video director McG doesn't have a clue asto how to tell a story, and all of the writers attached to the project,which include, but are probably not limited to, Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon andJohn August, are not much help.  But this is a film in which you just kickback and enjoy some high kicking gals wallop everything in sight.  Borrowingliberally from many other films, CHARLIE'S ANGELS steals the most from THEMATRIX.  In fact, it probably has more slow motion martial arts action thanwill be in all three MATRIX pictures combined.  Cheung-Yan Yuen deserves aspecial mention for his supervising of the film's over-the-top martial artsspecial effects.  Even if a bit repetitive, they are the second best part ofthe movie. What really makes the show shine are the three female leads, who areconvincingly tough, smart and, most of all, funny.  The actresses appear tobe having a ball, and we vicariously share in their romp.  (Yes, there werereports of tension on the set, but the movie shows none of these rumoreddifficulties.) As in the James Bond movies, sexual innuendo and humorously revealingcostumes provide much of the story's merriment.  ""Hey, I signed thoserelease papers, so you can just stick things in my slot,"" Natalie, with anexuberant and sweetly innocent smile, tells her UPS delivery man.  Later, inone of the film's best sequences, she cheerfully talks to her would-beboyfriend, a bartender named Pete (Luke Wilson), on her cell phone whilefighting for her life.  He offers to call her back, but he remains cluelessas to his intended love's real occupation.  All of the boyfriends serve as straight men to showcase the women's theircomedic skills.  Matt LeBlanc plays an actor on a set, and Alex comes onlocation to cook for him.  A truly awful cook, Alex's worst specialty is her""Chinese Fighter Muffins,"" which can be deadly.    The weirdest and least successful of the boyfriends is played by Tom Green,who was hilarious in ROAD TRIP.  This time he is an out-to-lunch fishermanwho refers to himself as The Chad and drives his boat like a little oldlady. The movie gets a lot of comedic mileage from Joseph G. Aulisi's costumesalone.  The angels go from German yodelers in short skirts to massage parlorgeishas.  The best, however, has Alex dressed like a dominatrix and theother two dressed in drag.  In the latter outfit, Alex is an efficiencyexpert from Hell, who comes to a software company to lecture a room full ofnerdy engineers dressed in geeky white shirts.  As she pounds the table withher black riding stick, row after row of software programmers jump straightup in the air in a scene reminiscent of PINK FLOYD THE WALL. Our 3 action heroes are not above providing each other a lot of girlishadvice such as ""flip your hair"" to attract the opposite sex.  It works, bythe way, but I suspect that having Cameron Diaz's face is the real key toits success. So is there a story?  Yes, but it is so inconsequential and contrived thatthere's little point in discussing it.  This much I will reveal.  Theproducers clearly think, correctly, that the movie will make a bundle sothey've made sure that they end it in such a way as to make a sequelpossible.  All we have to do is ask by buying lots of tickets.  My guess isthat we will.  CHARLIE'S ANGELS is far from a great movie, but it isentertaining and fun, which is more than I can say about most recent movies. CHARLIE'S ANGELS runs 1:33.  It is rated PG-13 for action violence, innuendoand some sensuality and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and older. My son Jeffrey, age 11, said that he really liked it and gave ***.  Hementioned how much it borrowed from THE MATRIX.  Overall, he liked themartial arts but wished that it would have had a little more story.  (Don'twe all.)",Charlie's Angels,PG-13,2000,3

Doing Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, HiddenDragon"" more than one or two better in the stunt department, Cameron Diaz as Natalie Cook, Drew Barrymore as DylanSanders, and Lucy Liu as Alex Munday survive bullets, free-falls, explosions, and best of all stick together despite thewedding bells that could have broken up that old gang of theirs.     In a story that glorifies women as smart, athletic, gorgeousand deadly while the men are either slow, vicous or clowns,""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" takes us from scene to sceneunburdened by fusty conventions of credibility or anything thatIsaac Newton thought he knew when that apple fell on his head. No matter that the plot is even thinner than Demi Moore,consisting of the search not for one ring (leave elementary stufflike that to J.R.R. Tolkien) but for two, both needed by the badguys as a Rosetta Stone to the identities of all who enjoy thegovernment's largesse in the witness protection program.  Theprincipal villain, Madison Lee (Demi Moore) is a fallen angelwho seeks the two rings which, when put together through acomputer will reveal this information which she can then sell toa vindictive band of mafiosi from Japan, Italy and Latin America. While they, predictably enough,  find the rings, getting there isall the fun, allowing the make-up and costume people (KimberlyGreene and Charyl Beasley Blackwell respectively) to give thethree angels virtually new identities whether their heads arecovered with rubber masks or the finely tuned bodies outfittedwith dazzling threads that could attract audience attention evenon Oscar night.     The most fun of all is had by by former music-video directorand helmer of ""Full Throttle,""  McG, who's had three years tooutdo what he achieved in the original frothy pic which featuredoperatives working for an unseen boss at a detective agency. Unfortunately, there's a deja-vu: this time, as then, the funbegins to pall halfway through, but then again how do you top astunning, James-Bond style opener honing in on the threebeauties who rescue a guy from the clutches of some sinisterrogues in Northern Mongolia with six-foot long rapiers andmacho to match?  Other than that, the dirt-bike race is thewinning edge-of-your-seat contest where, as the starter intones,""the only rule is that there are no rules.""  In the Ben-Hurmayhem that follows, bikers kick one another over the cliffs,even knock out a few rounds of their pistols while riding upsidedown on their wheels.     As for chemistry, usually important in romantic dramas andcomedies and now a given in spunky action thrillers, you can'tbeat the combination of Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore andCameron Diaz, none of whom tries to upstage the othersalthough Ms. Diaz, whether performing some hot dances,swooning to the entreaties of her boyfriend Pete (Luke Wilson),or kicking butt, is first among equals.       Cameron Diaz aside, the cognoscenti will probably be buzzingabout Demi Moore, a middle-aged mother back from a fewyears off from the big ones, who dazzles the crowd the most: asleek, sharp, Greek-bodied meanie who is believably a matchfor all three of the angels.  This high-budget production getsmore energy than it requires from side roles such as CrispinGlover's as The Thin Man, Bernie Mac as the behind-the-scenes helper, and John Cleese as the bewildered dad whothanks to a few of Matt LeBlanc's double entendres as Alex'sboyfriend thinks that his daughter, Alex, is naughtier than evenan angel has the right to be. ",Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,PG-13,2003,2.5
170,"      Films live or die on the strength of their scripts.  Writer anddirector Kevin Smith's third part of his New Jersey trilogy, CHASINGAMY, amuses, delights, and moves the audience with its highlyirreverent dialog.  The trilogy's first two parts were the acclaimed,low-budget hit CLERKS and the less successful MALLRATS.       (CHASING AMY's ending credits include ""And to all the critics whohated our last flick -- all is forgiven.""  Only independent filmmakerswould have the courage to call attention to their bad reviews.)       CHASING AMY offers much more than an effective screenplay.  Thefilm's actors breathe life into characters that in other such plotswould quickly degenerate into cliches or slapstick.  Instead, thispicture's population has some eminently likable people who are,frankly, just fun to hang out with.       The film features Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams as a pair ofstar-crossed lovers.  Ben plays Holden McNeil, part of a cartoonistduo.  Jason Scott Lee is his friend since childhood and cartoonistpartner Banky Edwards.  Banky, whose role as a mere cartoon ""tracer,""gets him no end of ridicule.  Well, someone has to paint in the figuresthat Holden outlines.       Joey Lauren Adams as Alyssa ""Finger Cuffs"" Jones, gives abreathless, almost Marilyn Monroe style, rendition of a blondebombshell.  Seeming at first to be someone only slightly smarter than abimbo, her part rapidly evolves into the most complex and challengingcharacter in the story.  An accomplished actress whose compellingperformance draws you into all her character's unpredictable twists andturns.       The show has two parts -- starting as comedy but slowly evolvinginto a touching drama.  The first, and admittedly my favorite, partrelies on natural, but highly sexual conversations for the humor.  Thegood spirited dialog has the quick cadence of BEFORE SUNRISE, but thelanguage and the subject matter revolve around explicit sexualrepartee.  Most of this is almost impossible to capture in a review forgeneral audiences.  One of the few printable lines has Banky explaininghis sexual techniques to Alyssa over drinks on what looks like a doubledate.  He says he tells his lovers exactly what is happening, ""like CNNand the Weather Channel -- constant updates.""  Holden rolls his eyes ashe wonders what his Howard Stern-like partner will say next.  Banky andAlyssa even show each other their sexual war wounds.  (Yes, I did notrealize these existed either.)       The simple plot of the picture moves in surprising ways, and thefilm gets more mileage out of its setup than I thought possible.  Iexpected the script to stay with the jokes until they had long sinceworn out their welcome, but part way through, it becomes obvious thatSmith has a serious story to tell about relationships.       From the first time Holden sees Alyssa, he is smitten by hercharms.  As she flirts incessantly with him, the chemistry between themis genuine and infectious.  Soon the director is certain to cut to thescene where Holden and Alyssa jump into bed together.  Well, maybe not.       Holden goes to a bar where Alyssa sings a song to the one sheloves.  He beams with pride as she looks his way.  After her number isover, she walks into the audience and plants a big juicy one on herlover -- Kim (Carmen Lee).  Shock would be a mild description ofHolden's reaction.       In one of the plot's delicious twists, Holden and Alyssa staygreat friends and have a string of platonic dates.  Alyssa probesHolden's feeling about homosexuality.  ""So, you've never been curiousabout men?""  she inquires.  ""Well, I've always wondered why my fatherwatched Hee Haw,"" he responds.       After bottling up his love too long, he explodes and confesses howmuch he loves her.  ""You are the epitome of everything I've ever lookedfor in another human being,"" he solemnly tells her.  The thought of astraight man going for her sends her body into convulsions of anger andother emotions.       How this gets resolved I will not say, but it happens before themidpoint of the show, so most of the film occurs afterwards.  In anunpredictable story, my favorite part is how, at the end, Holdenattempts to bring closure to their myriad of difficulties.  The scenecomes out of left field, but the emotions in it are raw and honest.       In a show about relationships, most of the people are either gayor lesbian.  Holden and Banky seem to be the only practicingheterosexuals left.  The chemistry and camaraderie between them couldform the subject for an entire review.  Jason Scott Lee is terrificallyfunny as a cheerleader for the heterosexual cause, but all three of theleads are precious.       Kevin Smith's skills are best shown in the script.  Hisdirectorial judgments are uneven.  Typical of the scenes that do notwork is the one where he interlaces a cliched hockey bloodfest with akey confrontation between Holden and Alyssa.  Smith and Scott Mosieredited the film, and too often they fell in love with their material.Many scenes would have been handsomer with a little trimming.       The sign of a good movie comes with your reaction when the endingcredits roll.  I left the theater wishing I did not have to leave mynewly found friends.  A more likable threesome I have not seen in sometime.       CHASING AMY runs 1:41.  It is rated R for explicit and constantsexual humor and for profanity.  The film would be fine for matureteenagers.  I recommend this sweet and captivating picture to you andgive it ***. ",Chasing Amy,R,1997,3.5
171,"The first of two romantic comedies scheduled for this year about thedaughter of the President of the United States (the other is ""FirstDaughter,"" starring Katie Holmes), ""Chasing Liberty"" takes this soon-to-be-short-livednovel premise and then offers no other reason for its existence. Asa love story, it is a strictly cookie-cutt er affair, seemingly cobbledtogether on an assembly line of genre cliches. And as a comedy, itholds no memorably clever lines or even very much to laugh at at all.The movie is simply content to run through the motions for an interminable111 minutes, where sparks of interest are few and far between andthe only thing worth looking at is the pretty European scenery. With her father (Mark Harmon) having been the U.S. President for thepast six years, 18-year-old Anna Foster (Mandy Moore) has scarcelyknown any other life than one in the spotlight and without privacy.Yearning to reclaim her freedom from the Secret Service agents thatare constantly following her around, Anna escapes their grasp whileon a trip in London and pairs up with handsome 23-year-old backpackerBen Calder (Matthew Goode) to travel to Berlin for a Love Festivaltaking places in a few days. Their trouble-filled journey takes themon a tour through the likes of Prague and Venice, while Anna startsto fall in love with Ben. What she doesn't yet realize, however, isthat Ben is a Secret Service agent himself, sent to be her protection. Directed by Andy Cadiff, making his feature debut after a string oftelevision work, ""Chasing Liberty"" is dreary and listless, a romancebetween two people who bicker for 90 minutes and then fall for eachother for the sole reason that the plot demands it. There is a startlinglack of chemistry between Mandy Moore and newcomer Matthew Goode,at least partially because their respective roles of Anna and Benare never fully likable. ""You think I'm just a spoiled, pampered brat,but you're wrong,"" Anna defensively tells Ben at the midway point,and then never does anything to prove him wrong. Indeed, in a lacklusterscreenplay Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman, it is difficult toget behind Anna and root for her because her every action is self-serving. For Mandy Moore, an effervescent talent who has smoothly transitionedfrom being a singer to a credible actress, this is a poorly writtenpart that does her no favors. Whatever charm Anna holds, it is becauseof Moore's performance. After much weightier roles in 2002's ""A Walkto Remember"" and 2003's ""How to Deal,"" this is a step down for her,and something she could probably do in her sleep. As love interestBen, Matthew Goode struggles to stand out. For the most part, Benis a dullard with few distinguishing characteristics, and Goode hastrouble fleshing h im out. Lending meager support are Mark Harmon(2003's ""Freaky Friday""), who seems awfully meek to be the President,and the underrated Jeremy Piven (2003's ""Runaway Jury"") and AnnabellaSciorra (1998's ""What Dreams May Come"") as a pair of agents secretlyfollowing Anna while sparking an unlikely romance of their own. Filmed on location in Prague, London, Berlin, and Venice, ""ChasingLiberty"" plays like a luscious travelogue and little else. The charactersare mostly one-dimensional, sitcom-style creations, and the plot isso thin as to be nearly transparent. The only would-be suspense tocome of any of it is whether Anna and Ben will get together in theend, and the answer to such a query can be guessed before the filmeven starts. Had Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode shared the requiredchemistry to make their romance an involving one, there might havebeen some worth to this project. Unfortunately, there is none betweenthemsomething that doesn't seem so tragic since their relationship(and their shallow characters) are never worth caring about, anyway.""Chasing Liberty"" marks the first notable bomb of the 2004 movie season.Let's hope the upcoming ""First Daughter"" isn't this generic.",Chasing Liberty,PG-13,2004,1.5

The only three minutes of it at all worth seeing is acheesy dance number that occurs at the end.    The plot features a hunk, played by Eduardo Veræstegui, who attracts women likeflies to honey.  Walking through an airport, he causes even octogenarians andnuns to instantly lust after his body.  Although the story claims he has onlythree girlfriends, Patricia (Jaci Velasquez), Lorena (Roselyn Sanchez) and Cici(Sofça Vergara), I'll swear the count was closer to thirty.  But, since theslapstick story has the women acting like Baywatch babes running around likeKeystone cops, it's hard to keep track of everything.  Our screening had Spanish subtitles, which I found helpful.  I don't speak orread any Spanish, but the subtitles were helpful in staying awake, somethingthat my wife didn't accomplish.  I would listen to the English and try toidentify which part of the Spanish text matched the spoken words.  It was amindless game, which helped me pass the time.  The convoluted story involves the women bonding after discovering that they hadbeen cheated on by the same man, who even gave them similar lingerie gifts. These newly unattached females travel around, unknowingly, with a bag of moneyin their car, while bad guys with tiny brains and a sexy FBI agent named Carmen(Lisa Vidal) follow them.  The editor must have been paid by the cut.  Watching these gals in their oldjalopy can give you severe whiplash, as the movie cuts every few seconds tosomething else.  I have no idea if these actresses can act.  The editor neverslowed down long enough to let me figure it out.  The whole movie is one --thankfully -- forgettable blur.    CHASING PAPI runs 1:20.

173,"Based on the book by Frank B. Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey,""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is an unmitigated, end-of-the-year lump ofcoal that should put to rest all of the unwarranted backlash against""The Cat in the Hat."" A chaotic, horridly conceived, inconceivablyone-dimensional product, ""C heaper by the Dozen"" wants to be a qualityfamily film about the trials and ultimate joys of raising twelve children,yet holds not a single believable or genuine moment in all of its95 minutes. That it wins an instant spot on my ""Worst of 2003"" list goes without saying. Narrated at the beginning and end by Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt), matriarchof the Baker clan, she explains how she and husband Thomas (SteveMartin) have arrived at being the parents of an even dozen children,ages four to twenty-two. When Thomas is offered the well-paying jobof his dreams as a college football coach, he packs the family upand moves them to a bigger house in a nearby Chicago suburb. All iswell, if constantly hectic, for the Baker's, until Kate's book, entitled""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" is given a publishing offer. With her awayfor several weeks to do publicity, Thomas finds himself way in overhis head, trying to manage his coaching and his children all by himself. Directed by Shawn Levy (2003's ""Just Married""), ""Cheaper by the Dozen""purports to being a realistic, humor-filled look at raising kids,yet goes so far in the opposite direction it might as well be seton a different planet. Written by Craig Titley, the film rings witha resounding falseness from start to finish. The characters, includingall but one of the children, are Screenwriting 101 rejects, paper-thinand unctuous with no discernible identity outside of one or two charactertraits each. In some cases, there isn't even that much development.Director Shawn Levy's main technique, used to the point of sheer despicableannoyance, is to round the twelve kids up and have them speak allat the same time, creating nothing but noise and inertia from a plot standpoint. The younger Baker kids mostly just run around and wreak havoc, unableto form even a plausible sibling bond with their co-stars. The soleexception is outcast Mark (F orrest Landis), nicknamed ""Fed Ex,"" whodoesn't seem to fit in and is relegated to the attic bedroom withhis pet turtle. No attention is paid to him by anyone, not even fatherThomas, until he runs away from home. The potentially poignant andauthentic representation of Mark, well played by newcomer ForrestLandis, is all but destroyed in a truly hateful, condescending climaxin which a father-son hug and a few unconvincing, one-line siblingremarks seemingly solve all of his problems. The three oldest Baker kids15-year-old Lorraine (Hilary Duff), 17-year-oldCharlie (Tom Welling), and 22-year-old Nora (Piper Perabo)are no betterdeveloped, mostly coming off as selfish, whiny nitwits. For example,when Thomas is at his lowest point, having trouble tending to hisnine younger children by himself, he has a heart-to-heart with Lorraine,explaining to her that he is going to need to find a baby-sitter tohelp out. In a smart film, one that did not hold its audience i ncontempt, Lorraine would have spoken up and offered to help her fatherherself. Instead, the 15-year-old's clear ability to do so is neverbrought up, and Lorraine flightily remains content to stay in herroom and put on make-up. Meanwhile, Charlie basically broods aboutswitching schools and varsity football teams, while it takes Norafar too long to realize that her model-actor boyfriend, Hank (AshtonKutcher), is as vain as they come. In actuality, and certainly notintentionally, Ashton Kutcher (2003's ""My Boss's Daughter"") makesMark far more mature and likable than any of the Baker's until thescreenplay conveniently turns him into a walking stereotype. As parents Thomas and Kate, Steve Martin (2003's ""Bringing Down theHouse"") and Bonnie Hunt (1999's ""The G reen Mile"") escape mostly unscathed,attempting to bring a level of balance to a family that has none.Martin, usually very funny, has no successful comic material to workwith, while Hunt plays the straight man. As Lorraine, Hilary Duff(2003's ""The Lizzie McGurie Movie"") seems to be playing the same bubblycharacter she is quickly and tiresomely becoming known for, only withmore exaggeration and less charm. And as eldest siblings Charlie andNora, Tom Welling (TV's ""Smallville"") and Piper Perabo (2000's ""CoyoteUgly"") are talented actors who are criminally wasted in one-note parts. Syrupy, dumb, and desperately unfunny (I laughed once, and that wasduring the end-credits blooper reel), ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is theworst family film of the year, a sub-sitcom-level failure as abhorrentas it is half-baked. With no character worth liking , no story developmenteven remotely surprising, and no comedy or drama creating any trueemotion within the viewer, the film is simply interminable. Even thefinal scene, set at Christmas dinner, is poorly constructed. As Thomaslooks around the table at the faces of his children, the intentionwas obviously to show how happy he is with his life, his marriage,and his ""darling"" kids. As edited, however, the final expression onThomas' face appears to be one of confusing distaste. Maybe SteveMartin forgot the camera was rolling, and was just then realizingwhat a cinematic mess he had gotten himself into. Such a theory makesa whole lot more sense than anything found in ""Cheaper by the Dozen.""",Cheaper By The Dozen,PG,2003,2

You knewyour place in the scheme of things and, if you happened to forget,someone would remind you."" That's the way Lasse Hallstrom (""The CiderHouse Rules"") begins this romantic magical fable about a mysterioussingle mother (Juliette Binoche) opens a chocolate shop during Lent,antagonizing the righteous, patriarchal Mayor (Alfred Molina) andyoung priest (Hugh O'Conor) but tempting and transforming the stodgy,drab townsfolk with her tasty confections - while teachingtolerance. A Julia Roberts lookalike, Juliette Binoche embodies thissensual, cocoa-obsessed woman, delving into life's dark bitterness andfrothy sweetness, as she mothers her troubled daughter (VictoireThivisol) and romances sexy Johnny Depp, a guitar-strummingvagabond. Carrie Ann Moss is a repressed mother whose keeps her sonaway from his feisty, outspoken grandmother, played by JudiDench. Hallstrom's real-life wife, Lena Olin engages as the abusedwife of brutish cafe-owner Peter Stormare but Leslie Caron has barelya cameo as a Gallic matron. Combining a dollop of ""Like Water forChocolate,"" a dash of ""Tom Jones"" and a pinch of ""Woman on Top,"" thestory uses chocolate as a metaphor for pleasure, freedom andrebellion. Adapting Joanne Harris' richly layered best-seller,screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs has wisely changed the villainouspriest into a prissy nobleman.

175,"CHOPPER, written and directed by Andrew Dominik, is based on the bookswritten by one of Australia's most notorious criminals, Mark ""Chopper"" Read,but the film is careful to point out that the story is not a biography, perse.  What it is is a chilling tale that is made even more intriguing bybeing based on a real criminal.   The compelling reason to see CHOPPER is the tour de force performance byEric Bana as Chopper.  (A reason not to see it, for some, is that it isintense, realistic and graphically violent.)  Bana so inhabits his part asChopper that it becomes hard to belief that he is just acting.  Bana isprobably a sweet guy in real life, but, after seeing this movie, you'dprobably run away if you met him in public.   Chopper, looking like a Hell's Angel with an almost indecipherable Aussieaccent, has rolls of fat on his beer belly.  His skin is tattooed, not withworks of body ""art"" but rather with something that looks more like doodling,and his mouth is filled with shiny metal teeth.  Even with all of thesebodily distractions, he still comes across as a strangely likable guy, whojust happens to be a sociopath who might kill you instantly because of areal or imagined offense against him. Between violent episodes in and out of prison, there are some humorousscenes as well.  Chopper knows that his girlfriend, Tanya (Kate Beahan),works in a brothel.  Jealous since he thinks she's seeing someone, he asksher whom she's screwing.  Laughing out loud, she reminds him what she doesfor a living.  After thinking a minute, which doesn't come naturally toChopper, he demands to know whom she has been kissing, figuring that shesaves that for her lovers.  Chopper is the kind of guy to whom there are noright answers.  Luckily, she and her mother are only beaten, not killed. Although most viewers are probably uncomfortable with such intenseexperiences as CHOPPER, for those who can stomach it, this movie is afascinating portrait of a frightening man.  And it contains a greatperformance by Eric Bana. CHOPPER runs 1:34.

176,"""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" a $90-million sequel to 2000's taut sleeperhit ""Pitch Black"" that follows the title anti-hero through an expandingotherwordly mythology, has been the dream project of Vin D iesel (2002's""XXX"") for several years. While credit deservedly goes to the buff,charismatic actor for making the film a reality, the watered-downend result badly hinders whatever potential or worth it could havehad. For one, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" has been downgraded froman R-rating to PG-13, a major mistake that seems to hold the materialback at every moment. And two, the script by David Twohy (who alsodirects) is practically incomprehensible. It isn't impossible to followthe premise and its developments, but alarmingly few reasons are evergiven for why anything that happens is occurring. With little to nonarrative depth or involvement, the picture becomes a thankless visualspectacle, marvelous to look at but woefully empty where its heart should be. Set five years after the events of ""Pitch Black,"" escaped convictRiddick (Vin Diesel), who has the ability to see in the dark, showsup on the plane t of Helion Prime in an attempt to clear his name.His mission is misplaced, however, when the people of the planet areravaged by the Necromongers, a superhuman, soulless breed of creaturethat wishes to turn all into one of them. The reason of why is neverexplained, but the Necromongers are run by the evil Lord Marshal (ColmFeore), as well as second-in-command Vaako (Karl Urban) and his wife,Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton). Meanwhile, Riddick finds the time totravel to the prison planet of Crematoria, where the rays of the sunare deadly, to reunite with young Jack, now a tough 17-year-old youngwoman who goes by the name of Kyra (Alexa Davalos). His devotion toher, like so many of the plot particulars, is never satisfactorilyexplained. Nonetheless, Riddick and Kyra are unwillingly put in theroles of the heroes (Riddick discovers he is the last of a warriorrace known as Furian, and that is why he is wanted), as they set outto stop the Necromongers from taking over the entir e universe. Directed by David Twohy (2002's ""Below""), ""The Chronicles of Riddick""is an ambitious failure, admirable in its attempt to create a completelynew sci-fi world and characters without having to be based on a comicbook or novel, but perfectly lousy in bringing that vision to life.The characters are vaguely drawn, at best, perplexing in their actionsand placed at a distance from the viewer. Because they are wafer-thinand there is no background given for most of them, one is left wonderingwhy they should be given a damn about. And the how's and why's ofthe story are unfortunately glazed over in exchange for a series ofmind-numbing action set-pieces that are almost all devoid of energyor palpable tension. The exception is a fast-paced chase through thedevastated, mountainous landscape of Crematoria by Riddick, Kyra,and a group of convicts to beat the deadly rise of the sun. Otherwise,the film is painfully by-the-numbers in its wrongheaded conceptionas a brainless popcorn movie when the complex plot clearly calledfor more development and care. As the reluctant Riddick, who doesn't choose to be the good guy asmuch as he is forced into it to save his own skin, Vin Diesel fitscomfortably back into the role. All rippled muscles, baritone voice,and glowing eyes, Diesel is ideal as an action star, but needs tobranch out from this limiting genre if he wants to have any sort ofHollywood staying power. As for Vaako and femme fatale Dame Vaako,oft-described as a futuristic version of Lady Macbeth, Karl Urban(2002's ""Ghost Ship"") and Thandie Newton (2002's ""The Truth AboutCharlie"") seem confused as to how they have found themselves in thisoverblown world of blue screens. Along with Judi Dench (2002's ""DieAnothe r Day"") as Aeron, a supernatural guiding light on Riddick'squest, the three of them are wasted. Dench's Aeron, known as an Elemental,who uses the elements to configure into a solid being, had some realpotential, but remarkably little is done with her or her intriguingrace. As sidekick Kyra, newcomer Alexa Davalos elicits a glimmer ofpromise with her butt-kicking, razor-happy character, but any chanceof she and Diesel forming a honestly felt kinship is overlooked asthe dull action moves full speed ahead. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is all discouraging doom and gloom, amoldy cliche of a science-fiction film without the vital feeling ofimminent danger. The villainous Necromongers physically appear as,for all intents and purposes, humans with stronger than usual strengthand no emotion behind their eyes. This was the wrong way to go withthese creatures, who never seem to pose much threat and, therefore,are giant bores. It doesn't help that their motives, like that ofthe rest of the characters, are highly sketchy. ""The Chronicles ofRiddick"" may hold dazzling visual effects and some darkly picturesquevistas, but that is where the picture's entertainment value comesto a halt. Vapid, sluggish, over-the-top, and uneventful in any meaningfulway, if ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" didn't have the basic skills thatdirector David Twohy does, indeed, possess, it would be comparableto 2000's laughable disaster ""Battlefield Earth."" That is one comparisonno filmmaker should ever strive for, or mistakenly find themselves a part of.","Chronicles Of Riddick, The",PG-13,2004,1.5
177,"    Adapted by John Irving from his own best-seller, this isthe extraordinary story of one boy's journey into maturity in the1940s. Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) grew up in a sheltered existence atan orphange in St. Clouds, Maine, under the kindly, paternal care ofether-addicted Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) who, each night, afterreading a chapter from Charles Dickens, bid the wistful, unwanted boysa poignant ""Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of NewEngland."" As Larch's favorite, Homer learns a lot about performingsafe, if illegal, abortions but less about right and wrong. Which iswhy he decides to explore the outside world, hitching a ride with ayoung woman (Charlize Theron) and her fiance (Paul Rudd), an Air Forcepilot. Taking a job as an apple picker, he joins a black migrantworker crew, headed by Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his daughter(Erykah Badu).  Director Lasse Hallstrom is sensitively andaffectionately in tune with Irving's off-beat, idiosyncraticcharacters, eliciting substantial, Oscar-caliber performances as Homercopes with a crisis of conscience involving abortion, medical ethicsand racial prejudice. Wide-eyed and impressionable, Tobey Maguire isdelicately convincing, particularly as he's dazzled by luminousCharlize Theron. Michael Caine not only masters the elusive accent butcaptures the fierce intensity and enormously touching vulnerability ofLarch. And edgy Delroy Lindo is tender yet terrifying, never hitting afalse note. The fable-like quality is greatly enhanced by OliverStapleton's vivid, impressionistic photography.

178,"""A Cinderella Story,"" a modern retelling of the classic fairy tale,is teen princess Hilary Duff's ""make-or-break"" motion picture. Untilnow, she has coasted on her endlessly cute, bubbly personality onTV's now-defunct ""Lizzie Maguire,"" its film spin-off, 2003's ""TheLizzie Maguire Movie,"" and in a royally annoying supporting turn in2003's ""Cheaper By the Dozen."" She was acceptable in 2003's ""AgentCody Banks,"" but that was more Frankie Muniz's movie than her's. CouldDuff make a smooth transition into stand-alone leading roles, developinga character other than her own squeaky-clean public persona? The answer,with much pleasant surprise, is yes. Hilary Duff may not be one ofthe most talented and polished among some of her teen peers„LindsayLohan (2004's ""Mean Girls"") could act circles around her any day ofthe week„but she has wisely toned down her constant peppiness forher most understated and effective performance, to date. Indeed, itis her sheer likability that breezily carries ""A Cinderella Story""through a fair share of rough patches. When she was a little girl, Samantha Montgomery (Hannah Robinson)was devastated to lose her beloved father in a Los Angeles earthquake.Now an unpopular 16-year-old high schooler with dreams of going toPrinceton University, Sam (Hilary Duff) whiles away her days studyinghard, waitressing at her late father's diner to earn cash for college,and answering to the every whim of her nasty stepmother, Fiona (JenniferCoolidge), and snooty stepsisters, Brianna (Madeline Zima) and Gabriella(Andrea Avery). A possible light at the end of a dark tunnel comesin the form of an Internet penpal she forms a real connection with„someonewho goes to her school and unknowingly is popular football hunk AustinAmes (Chad Michael Murray). When Sam finally meets her dream guy witha sensitive side at the Halloween dance, she undeniably falls forhim. The only problem is Austin doesn't know her identity (she waswearing a mask at the time), and Sam is afraid that he will rejecther when he finds out who she is. Directed by Mark Rosman (who made the unlikely slasher film, ""TheHouse on Sorority Row,"" some twenty-one years ago), ""A CinderellaStory"" is a tried-and-true teen-comedy-cum-romance, one that doesn'twin points for originality but slides by on alluring good will. Thescreenplay by first-timer Leigh Dunlap is a grab-bag of sharp one-liners,effortless knowledge of the teen movie formula, and, unfortunately,several lines of dialogue that clang with drippy sentimentality. Likewise,Dunlap parlays the moment of truth when Sam finally comes clean toAustin to needless lengths, bogging things down in a series of misunderstandingsthat could be so easily solved if Sam and Austin would just open upto each other. There are other elements that require a suspensionof disbelief„that the pretty Sam would be looked at as a pariah bythe popular crowd, that Austin wouldn't be able to figure out Sam'sidentity when the only part of her face hidden by a mask were hereyes„but t hese discrepancies go down easier than they should becausethis is, after all, supposed to be a fairy tale. And lest it seem like ""A Cinderella Story"" is riddled with nothingbut problems, there are a large number of unexpectedly shrewd details.What a refreshing delight, for example, that Austin quotes a poemand Sam instantly recognizes it as being by Alfred Tennyson. Sam andAustin are also developed as far more three-dimensional than mostfilms give teenagers credit for; instead of simply being dictatedby who they go to the prom with, these intelligent characters' livesinvolve real responsibilities, valid worries, and ambitious dreamsfor the future. Meanwhile, the romance that evolves between them islow-key and honest when it could have, in the wrong hands, been paper-thin.So often cinematic teen love stories are superficial, at best, occurringbecause the script requires them to get together rather than becausethere is an actual bond between them. The viewer senses that Sam andAustin are meant for each other, which makes what is at stake all the more sincerely felt. Hilary Duff, as previously mentioned, is attractively cast and wiserthan expected in her performance as the put-upon Sam Montgomery, whileChad Michael Murray (2003's ""Freaky Friday"") brings more soul andless of a dumb-jock feel to Austin. In the kind of priceless supportingrole she has perfected, Jennifer Coolidge (2001's ""Legally Blonde"")is equal parts spiteful and hilarious as Sam's meanspirited stepmother,Fiona. Coolidge has fun with the part, no more so than when fearingfor her life at the wheel of an out-of-control car while unable toshow emotion because of her recent Botox injection. As Sam's drama-lovingbest friend, Carter, Dan Byrd (2000's ""28 Days"") gets solid screentime and some sweet moments opposite Duff. Rounding out the centralcast is Regina King (2003's ""Daddy Day Care""), usually typecast innagging wife roles but given the chance here to play the virtuous,kind Rhonda„Sam's fairy godmother, of sorts. ""A Cinderella Story"" has its flaws and doesn't reinvent the wheel„toomany of Sam's stuck-up classmates are strictly stereotypes, for one,and where the plot is leading can be guessed a mile away„but the enchantinglyromantic climax set at a football game brings things back to theirgenial core. And while there is an obvious ""happily ever after"" ending,Samantha remains realistic and mature in her narration, admittingthat although she has found a great guy, there is no telling whatthe future may hold for their relationship. ""A Cinderella Story"" doesamiable justice to its well-known source material while putting apleasant spin on it. It's better than one may be lead to expect, whichis perhaps the best compliment of all. ","Cinderella Story, A",PG,2004,2

There are definite parallels to the partToni Collette played in Muriel's Wedding which was released in the USabout the same time.       Benny grows up with a circle of two main girlfriends played byGeraldine O'Rawe and Saffron Burrows.  They leave the village to go offto University.  There they meet a circle of boys lead by Jack (ChrisO'Donnell).  Benny is ambitious about her schooling and her love lifeand falls instantly in love with Jack.       As you would guess, there are complications and complexities.Some have to do with the small town, some with Benny's belief thatsince she is not beautiful and Jack is, he will not be interested inher, and still others have to do with the strict Catholic upbringing inIreland.  Of course, as in all movies, we find out that the church isalmost always in the wrong, and as soon as the characters grow upenough or get smart enough, they realize this and leave or ignore thechurch.  It would be nice to have religion appear in a movie every nowand then in a positive light.  After all, we have lots of movieglorifying everything from gangsters to heavy drinking to you name it.Oh well, ...       The problem with the movie is that, based on the information Ijust gave you, you could write the script now, and you would probablybe close.  The writer (Andrew Davies) took no risks, and the result isa completely predictable plot.  The director (Pat O'Donnell) went thesafe route as well making for a nicely homogenized show.  This is allquite surprising since the talent of Minnie Driver was clear and yetwas so often underutilized.  Moreover, the writer also wrote the veryinventive script for the To Play The King British series recently onPBS here and the director did the extremely moving and imaginativemovie Cal.       Although it could have been much better, and although I was ableto forecast every turn in the movie, I did enjoy being a member ofBenny's circle of friends for a couple of hours.  She was a characterI'm glad I got to know.  Her strength of conviction and her charm wovea spell on me.       CIRCLE OF FRIENDS runs a little long at 1:52.  It is rated PG-13for sexual discussions and scenes.  There is no nudity of any kind andno violence.  The movie would be fine for anyone old enough to beseriously interested in romance, say 10 and above I guess.  I give themovie a mild thumbs up with the reservations mentioned above, and Iaward it ** 1/2. ",Circle of Friends,PG-13,1995,2.5
180,"         If they really wanted a title to sum up the movie, they'd change the ""C"" in ""City"" to an ""Sh."" As you can guess, it wasn't quite the viewing experience I expected. Al Pacino is excellent as always, but is relegated to the background of the movie to deliver key speeches from time to time. The real star of the movie is John Cusack, with Bridget Fonda and Danny Aiello rounding out the cast. All three give good performances, but the story itself (and its poor pacing) brings the movie down.          CITY HALL tells a story of government corruption on the local level, corruption that unfolds when an off duty cop buying cocaine from a mobster's son gets in a shoot-out with the mobster's son, resulting in both their deaths and the accidental shooting death of a small child. That's the only action in the movie. The rest of the time we see Mayor Pacino giving speeches at press conferences and funerals, while Deputy Mayor Cusack plays detective in his spare time, solving the mystery of the murder.          The mystery doesn't lie in the murder itself but in the murderer--the mobster's son. A little investigative snooping by Cusack reveals that, at the mobster's son's trial, the recommended sentence was twenty to thirty years, but for some reason he got off with probation and was therefore able to cause the death of the innocent kid. Who in the New York political hierarchy pressured the judge into changing the sentence? Which official did the mobster bribe? Do we care? I certainly didn't. In fact, the best part of the movie, for me, was when I went out to the concession stand and bought a Cherry Coke and some nachos. I paid with a twenty but didn't get any change back.          I won't bore you with the details of Cusack's search or his ongoing sexual tension-fueled feud with Fonda, the lawyer representing the dead cop's wife, who hired Fonda to dispel charges that her husband was corrupt. I won't tell you about Aiello's character, the influential Brooklyn man involved in the conspiracy. And I'm sure not going to discuss the movie's message, that it's impossible to survive in politics without succumbing to compromise and corruption.          CITY HALL just wasn't my cup of Cherry Coke. It moved slowly, taking forever to reach its conclusion and, once it did, was anti-climactic. As you can probably guess, the ending involves a long speech from Pacino, who by this point in the movie seems more like the president of a high school debate club than an actual character. The story itself might have worked as a one-hour episode of ""Law and Order"" or a similar show, but not as a feature-length movie.",City Hall,R,1996,2
181,"      Although one cannot be sure what angels look like, Nicolas Cage,dressed from head to toe in somber shades of black, makes a mostimpressive one.  And unlike John Travolta's jocular version, Cage's hasall the seriousness of an undertaker.       With a tremendous sense of the visual but without muchstorytelling ability, director Brad Silberling attempts a remake of WimWenders's German film WINGS OF DESIRE.  Although Wenders's film is onlyten years, it is already being referred to as a classic.  WhySilberling, whose only other film was the mediocre CASPER, thought thiswas the right time and he was the right person to redo so recent amovie remains unclear.       Set in Los Angeles, the new film, called CITY OF ANGELS, starsCage as the angel Seth and Meg Ryan as a heart surgeon named MaggieRice.  With his long black coat and constant five-o'clock shadow, Cage,using small variations on his basic melancholic expression, rethinksthe whole concept of the angelic.       Angels, we learn, are not humans and never were.  They can be seenby mortals only if they want to be, which they rarely do.  Moresurprising, we find out that they hang out at the beach at sunrise andsunset so they can hear the celestial choirs and at the library therest of the day.  (Although you might expect to find them only amongthe religious tomes, they frequent all the sections.)       One day in the operating room as he waits to take a dying man'ssoul, Seth looks Maggie in the eye and becomes instantly smitten.  Hedreams of doing the unthinkable, touching Maggie.  The picture is atits most magical during the eventual first touch and first kisssequences.  Think way back to the excitement and rapture of the firsttime that you ever held a lover's hand and of your first romantic kiss.Rising above even these experiences, the scenes exist on a higher planethat may make goose pimples crawl up and down your arms.       The film works best when it reduces the story to a tableau.  Thetall, darkly dressed angles, dotting the beach for their morning musicby Gabriel Yared, provide the impact that the script by Dana Stevensrarely delivers.  (Wim Wenders is also listed on the writing creditssince he did the screenplay for the original movie.)  The audience atour screening was squirming in their seats since the movie seemed asthough it was going on for an eternity.  As good as some of the visualsare, they are highly repetitive and done excruciatingly slowly.       Maggie tells Seth that she doesn't believe in the hereafter.""Some things are true whether you believe in them or not,"" he explainswith his usual gravity.  The chemistry between them lacks the emotionalpunch that the story requires.  Although they both claim to be in lovewith each other, only Seth is at all convincing.       Along the way they get to know the film's best minor character, aheart patient of Maggie's named Nathan Messinger and played with gustoby Dennis Franz.  Nathan has a secret that drives the second half ofthe film.  Franz steals most of his scenes with an energy sadly lackingin the rest of the movie.       The monotonic and glacially paced story eventually comes to itscompletely predictable and highly manipulative ending.  The CITY OFANGELS could easily be remade as a short film with music but no words.Now that's a remake worth seeing.       CITY OF ANGELS runs 2:00.  It is rated PG-13 for sexuality andbrief male nudity and would be fine for kids around ten and up. ",City of Angels,PG-13,1998,2.5
182,"Those who don't approve current ""humanitarian"" bombing ofrump Yugoslavia often refer it as ""Clinton's War"". Whethertheir argument is valid or not, the fact remains that U.S.administration, and its chief executive, have enormouspowers at its disposal. Those powers, as any other, can beabused and the consequences of those abuses can bedisastrous or even apocalyptic, not only for those directlyaffected, but for the rest of world, America included. Oneof the rare Hollywood movies that tries to cover thatsubject and deal with the murky line between long-termnational and selfish political interest is CLEAR AND PRESENTDANGER, 1994 spy thriller and third in the series of moviesbased on the novels by Tom Clancy.  The movie begins when U.S. Coast Guard intercepts the yachtof wealthy American businessman and discovers the evidenceof massacre. It turns out that the businessman used to beclose friend of President Bennett (Donald Moffat), while inthe same time having links with Colombian drug lords.Infuriated because of his friend's death, President orderssecret war and assassination campaign to be conductedagainst drug cartel led by Ernesto Escobedo (MiguelSandoval). In the meantime, CIA analyst Jack Ryan (HarrisonFord) becomes the deputy for his mortally ill boss, AdmiralGreer (James Earl Jones). While investigating the series ofviolent events in Colombia, that start claiming toll inAmerican lives, he discovers the evidence of US government'scomplicity. Facing both by drug lords and unscrupulouspoliticians and top bureaucrats in Washington, Ryan would doanything in his power to uncover the scandal and save hiscountry and men from harm.  Although having the screenplay written by three differentauthors (John Millius, Donald Stewart and Steve Zaillian),CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, like very few movies incontemporary Hollywood, has a very complex, yet interestingand compelling plot. Unlike other two movies about TomClancy's hero Jack Ryan, this one doesn't present the brightpost-Cold War picture of the world dominated by omnipotentAmerican technology and military might. On the contrary, thefilm shows that even that power has limits, and biggestlimit of them all is the fact that behind the super-weaponrylies the hand of human who can be imperfect and incompetent.As a result, unlike most of the films in the action genre,this one is dark, depressive and sometimes even disturbing,and the happy ending is hardly unambiguous.  Director Philip Noyce, whose best work so far is anexcellent thriller DEAD CALM, worked with the script verywell. Action scenes are very well shot, and movie cleverlypaced, not allowing boredom for the viewers through thealmost two and half hours of its time. Characters, on theother hand, seem a little bit card-board, but in films likethis, they are secondary element. Anyway, this film hasgreat acting names in small roles, but although they don'tput their best efforts (including Ford, who probablycouldn't do much with such straightforward hero), they do afine job. Balance between cerebral and physical action isvery well done. Unfortunately, film in the end changes itscharacter - interesting, thought-provoking politicalthriller is downgraded with the finale in which we mustsuspend disbelief and see humble CIA bureaucrat Jack Ryan asRambo-style action hero. The impression is even worsenedwith melodramatic scenes in the end, when Jack Ryan showshis patriotic moral superiority of a civil servant overpragmatic politicians. Those who know how the real worldoperates would have some trouble believing those scenes inthe end. But, even with such flaws, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGERis a very fine piece of seldom seen brain candy fromHollywood. ",Clear and Present Danger,PG-13,1994,3
183,"The Patty Hearst case made terrific spreads for the media formonths, and justifiably so. This heir to what would today be afortune of a few billion dollars was kidnapped by theSymbionese Liberation Army, a Marxist group with absolutecontempt for the ""exploiting robber barons. Yet Ms. Hearstbonded with her abductors to such an extent that she joinedthem in making an armed robbery on a bank. How could thishappen? Sociologists call this Stockholm Syndrome_thetendency of people who are in the hands of captors to findcommon ground with them, perhaps from a sense of guilt fortheir own good fortune. ""The Clearing"" is not quite the same as the Patty Hearst storybut bears enough similarities to make one think back to thatevent. A film whose title has a double meaning_the clearingrepresenting the woods to which a kidnapper takes his victim,and also the way that events in the lives of the two are clearedup_""The Clearing is an intriguing story that has only a few of thefiery melodramatics that you'd expect if this were a big-budgetHollywood film, and is all the stronger for its respect for theaudience. The film varies from family drama to pulse-raisingthriller, with debut director Pieter Jan Brugge illustrating JustinHaythe first-time screenplay by placing parallel threads into twoseparate time frames to show what's happening in the luxurymansion when Eileen Hayes notes that her husband is missingfollowed by a reenactment of the actual kidnapping of WayneHayes (Robert Redford) by Arnold Mack (Willem Dafoe). While Eileen confers with her grown children, Tim (AlessandroNivola) and Jill (Melissa Sagemiller) and also with Agent RayFuller (Matt Craven), we subsequently are privy to the actualabduction wherein Arnold tricks Wayne into opening the door ofthe wealthy man's Mercedes, getting in, and leading him into thewoods where, we're told, he will be picked up by some men in acabin. Not much goes on in the Hayes mansion (actually filmed in anAtlanta suburb whereas the title clearing is filmed in Asheville,North Carolina), since Eileen seems almost nonchalant abouther missing husband. She carries on as though this were aneveryday event, swimming in her pool and holding a birthdayparty for her one-year-old grandchild. Nor is there particulartension in the FBI chase after the criminal. What separates thisfilm from others of the genre is the conversations betweenvictim and captor, the unemployed loser, Arnold, complains thathe has to send his wife to work as a waitress while Wayneenjoys the privileges of his money. We find out that things are seldom what they seem.  Waynehas lost something he can never get back. Because of hisattention to his work, particularly the car rental business thatraked in a fortune for him, he scarcely paid attention to hischildren and presumably not much more to his wife. What's notconvincing is Wayne's attempt to show that he shares lots ofcommon ground with the unhappy Arnold, as if to say thatmoney does not buy happiness. (Maybe so, but give me acouple of million and let me shop around a while for it.) The standout feature is the powerful performances of thethree leads: the always reliable Helen Mirren, who does notoverplay her grief; Willem Dafoe, a natural for a villain since heplayed a title role in ""Gods and Monsters,"" and Robert Redfordwho, though not mentioned in the press notes, is exquisitelymade up to look ten years older and almost ordinary.","Clearing, The",R,2004,3
184,"One of the greatest ironies of filmmaking is the fact thatquality doesn't seem to be the only or the most importantreason why films are remembered decades after theirpremiere. More often than not popularity is much moreimportant than artistic merit or influence on futurefilmmakers. In some cases films become cultural icons of itstime even without being popular. Such was the case withCLEOPATRA, 1963 historical spectacle directed by Joseph L.Mankiewicz. Today this film is remembered for many reasons -its budget that is unsurpassed even by present-day Hollywoodmegalomaniacs, romance between principal stars, and last butnot least, commercial failure which brought ""20th CenturyFox"" near bankruptcy and in many ways marked the end of OldHollywood.  Unlike majority of films that deal with the life and timesof legendary Egyptian queen, 1963 version of CLEOPATRA has aplot which is based on the works of Plutarch and otherprominent historians instead of Shakespeare's plays andsimilar works of fiction. The story begins in 48 BC, duringcivil wars that brought down old Roman Republic. Afterscoring decisive victory in the Battle of Pharsallos, Romangeneral and statesman Gaius Julius Caesar (played by RexHarrison) sails to Egypt in order to capture his fleeingarch- rival Pompeius. In Alexandria he finds Pompeiusmurdered and Egypt embroiled in its own civil war betweenyoung King Ptolemy (played by Joseph O'Sullivan) and hisbanished sister and co-ruler Cleopatra (played by ElizabethTaylor). Motivated by desire to provide cheap Egyptian grainfor Roman citizens and thus secure his political base,Caesar at first wants to mediate in the conflict, butCleopatra uses her charm, intelligence and diplomaticability to bring him and his legions to her side. Politicalalliance becomes intertwined with romantic liaison thatresults with the birth of Caesar's son Caesarion. The childis supposed to unite military might of Rome and wealth ofEgypt and thus bring total domination over entire knownworld. But Caesar's fellow Romans feel uncomfortable aboutthis dynastic scheme, fearing that their Caesar mightsacrifice republican ideals and Roman freedom for the sakeof Egyptian despotism. Band of conspirators assassinatesCaesar and causes another civil war that would shatterCleopatra's ambitions of global empire. Among the victors isCaesar's most trusted lieutenant Mark Anthony (played byRichard Burton), and years later he would become member ofgoverning triumvirate in charge of Roman eastern provinces.When Anthony, who lacks Caesar's governing and politicalskills, gets into financial trouble, Cleopatra is more thanable to seize this opportunity and seduce Anthony both byher own charm and Egyptian resources. This romantic andpolitical alliance, however, provides excellent opportunityfor Caesar's nephew and designated heir Octavian (played byRoddy McDowall). Seeing Anthony as the only remainingobstacle to his absolute rule over Roman Empire, he wouldmanipulate Senate into declaring war on Egypt and Anthony,and thus set stage for great conflict between East and West.  Like many other ""larger than life"" films from 1950s and1960s, CLEOPATRA represented Hollywood's attempt to beatemerging competition of television industry with spectacle,colours and images that audience couldn't enjoy on theirlittle black-and-white screens. However, unlike some othersuch instances, makers of CLEOPATRA decided to sacrificequality for the sake of quantity, and that later had seriousconsequences for the concept and execution of the project.Somehow convinced that the big budget would do the trick byitself, producers seemed to construct the film aroundon-screen display of their financial resources - either inthe form of spectacular scenes, single character's costumechanges or by hiring the most expensive actors or actressesavailable. In doing so, producers weren't discouraged byvarious incidents that used to plague or delay productionuntil those resources began to dry up, forcing filmmakers tocompromise the last trace of original artistic vision.  As a result, CLEOPATRA, despite its enormous budget, looksunfinished. The reason might be found in source material -Cleopatra's life was more suitable for mini-series thanfeature film. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, one of directorsinvolved in this project, was aware of this so he planned toturn six hours of filmed material in two separate three-hour movies - one dealing with Cleopatra's relationship withCaesar, and another dealing with her doomed romance withAnthony. Unfortunately, studio heads were against this ideaand forced him to cut filmed material in half, resultingwith single three-hour version (expanded to four hours in1995 special edition). Because of that CLEOPATRA looks liketwo two-hour films loosely patched together and varying inquality. The first part is much better, mostly due to Caesarbeing much more intriguing protagonist than weak Anthony andregal Rex Harrison displaying much better performance thanoften not very inspiring Richard Burton. Role of Cleopatrais, of course, the best known in Elizabeth Taylor's career,and the great actress (here undoubtedly looking at her best)does more than decent job, but all of her efforts are invain due to terribly wooden dialogue. Apart from Harrison,the best role was undoubtedly played by Roddy McDowall, whomanage to outshine everyone by portraying Machiavellisticvillain. Hume Cronyn is fine as Cleopatra's advisorSysogenes, Martin Landau is also very good as Anthony'slieutenant Rufio, same as Andrew Keir as Octavian's admiralAgrippa. Other actors, some of them fine, are wasted inroles that serve no other purpose but to show that CLEOPATRAhas as diverse and stellar cast as possible.  However, the worst problem of CLEOPATRA is the pace which isslow even by standards of those accustomed to pre-MTV styleof filmmaking. Much of three/four hours of running time arespent on scenes that should have been left on the cuttingfloor. This is especially so with the scenes of Cleopatra'striumphal entries to Rome and Tarsus that seem to goforever. Although even contemporary audience might be awedwith the millions of dollars spent in sets and costumes orhundreds of professional dancers or tens of thousands ofextras, those scenes often create unnecessary pauses in theplot. Like anything else in CLEOPATRA, pacing is much betterin first than in second part. While Caesar's segment lookslike a coherent whole, Anthony's story is often disorganised(and not particularly well edited) mess. For example,audience has to wait for the whole hour before climacticBattle of Actium brings its final and rather predictableconsequences to protagonists.  In one aspect CLEOPATRA nevertheless manages to be superiorto majority of other historical spectacles. Script writtenby three (plus one uncredited) authors takes history veryseriously and it is much more faithful to real life eventsthan some other and better- acclaimed films like SPARTACUS.Authors also made sure to explain complex politicalsituation of 1st Century BC Mediterranean to the averageaudience, so CLEOPATRA could be understood even by thoseviewers who didn't enjoy benefits of classical education.Unfortunately, due to budget cuts the most important eventof Cleopatra's era - Battle of Actium - is displayed inunsatisfactory manner. Although WATERWORLD thought us thatdifficulties of shooting mass scene on water can never beoverestimated, filmmakers could have shown that Anthony hadlost the battle due to Agrippa's superior tactics and shipdesigns.  However, despite rightfully deserving reputation oflegendary failure, CLEOPATRA looks like a stunningachievement compared to its present day counterparts andthose who endure watching it are going to be left with greatexperience. In a decades to come CLEOPATRA, same as now, isgoing to be viewed in the same way tourists watch ancientmonuments - old, abandoned, partially ruined yet still ableto create awe among new generations. ",Cleopatra,G,1963,2
185,"         Spike Lee strikes again, with another story of trouble in the hood. CLOCKERS shows us the influence older people have on young people and why innocent people sometimes take the rap for people they love. In this case, responsible brother Victor confesses to a murder his brother, Strike (don't ask about the name--my guess is his parents were big fans of either bowling or baseball), actually committed. It's a long story (about two hours and ten minutes worth), but Strike was following orders from his boss Rodney, who got absolutely no respect from the victim.          Strike is a clocker. No, he doesn't manufacture timepieces, he does something infinitely more illegal, selling crack. (It's a shame people throw their lives away raising money for their crack addiction when they can get it free by watching ""NYPD Blue."" One of life's better-kept secrets, I guess.) Strike isn't just protected by his brother, he also has an older cop named Andre looking out for him. Apparently, the two of them were once good friends, until the dangerously lethal world of drug dealing lured Strike into its menacing claws, as revealed by this line of dialogue--while Strike is riding in Andre's cop car, handcuffed:        STRIKE: These cuffs is tight.        ANDRE: You and me used to be tight.          Yes, it sounds every bit as corny in the movie as it does on paper, but I can forgive the occasional lapse in good drama the same way I can forgive the speech every character eventually gives, from clockers Strike and Rodney to cops Andre and Harvey Keitel, who plays the homicide detective convinced Victor is covering up for his brother. Keitel and John Turturro, who is mostly kept in the background as Keitel's partner, are the token white guys in the movie.          Making matters worse, Strike takes a liking to a child named Tyrone, who looks up to the drug dealer as a hero. Strike casually shows Tyrone how to handle a gun and cut cocaine properly, remembering of course to tell Tyrone not to do those things himself because drugs and violence are bad. Needless to say, the hasty disclaimers contradicting the long monologues that precede them are ineffective, and soon Tyrone is imitating his older friend, with tragic results. The message is that, if little kids see grownups doing something that looks cool, they'll emulate it, no matter how many times adults half-heartedly tell them it's not good for them. I can honestly say that's the reason I started eating tubs of cake frosting at such an early age.          CLOCKERS is a compelling, dramatic story from a talented man who seems to reinvent his directorial style with each new movie. (The only thing all Spike Lee movies have in common is overuse of the F-word... ""fiddy."") This time, visually, it looks like a cross between MTV and ""Cops."" Thematically, the message of CLOCKERS is as important as any other Lee movie, and he once again paints a picture of a world where cops can give young black men body cavity searches in daytime at the park. I think I've seen this portrayal somewhere before, perhaps in an adult movie I saw at midnight in a hotel room. That's a different story...",Clockers,R,1995,3.5
186,"Both a teen romance and a story about having the ability to literallystop time in its tracks, ""Clockstoppers"" is a family-friendly fantasythat ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise. Followinga few novel scenes in the first half that take clever advantage ofthese ideas, screenwriters Rob Hedden, J. David Stern, and David N.Weiss put on autopilot as they deliver a tired action-movie climax. Dr. Earl Dopler (French Stewart) has made a major scientific breakthroughwith a process he calls ""hyper-time,"" which gives a person the abilityto move so quickly that it appears everything around them has stopped.In an attempt to solve the quick human aging that accompanies theuse of ""hyper-time,"" Dopler sends one of these special watches tohis mentor, Dr. George Gibbs (Robin Thomas). With George away on business,his teenage son Zak (Jesse Bradford) stumbles upon the powers of thewatch, using it as a means to impress his dream girl, Francesca (PaulaGarces). Unfortunately, when the secret government Dopler is workingfor, headed by Henry Gates (Michael Biehn), discovers that the watchis missing, they go after Zak and Paula to retrieve it. Directed by ""Star Trek"" alum Jonathan Frakes, ""Clockstoppers"" standsas a minor diversion that loses its way after a promising first half,and gradually disappoints with each mounting inconsistency in theplot. The idea of ""hyper-time"" is a fascinating one, and some of thespecial effects are rather cool to look at, as Zak and Francesca maketheir way around a city of people, cars, animals, and water that haveseemingly come to a standstill. After a while, though, the many contradictionsin this logic begin to bog the proceedings down. Things that regularlywould move at a plodding pace can be seen slowly moving while in ""hyper-time,""while really fast things, such as the cars on the road and a fan,don't appear to be in any sort of motion at all. The speed of thingsin this time state, it seems, do not move based on scientific reason,but on whatever is convenient for the plot. Director Frakes loses his way in the second half, forgetting the magicof the opening scenes in exchange for jumbled and cliched story developments.The finale, especially, is a hodgepodge of messily thought-out science-fictionelements and dull-witted action setpieces. What does work to a more successful degree are the attractive performancesand nicely subtle chemistry between Jesse Bradford (2000's ""BringIt On"") and Paula Garces (1995's ""Dangerous Minds""), as Zak and Francesca.For a movie primarily targeted at pre-teens, the delicate romancethat blossoms between the two is charming. One scene, in particular,set to Uncle Kracker's surprisingly good cover of the '80s Cyndi Laupersong, ""Time After Time,"" is lovely. When the ill-fated plot finallygoes into overdrive by the one-hour mark, the promising treatmentof Zak and Francesca's relationship is put on the back-burner. While undiscriminating pre-pubescent tweens may find a lot to be entertainedwith in ""Clockstoppers,"" everyone else should be able to pick up onall of the sloppiness found within the screenplay. Whether the budgetsimply wasn't generous enough to let the filmmakers use more mileageout of its intriguing key conceit or not, ""Clockstoppers"" simply doesn'tmake the cut. What a shame it is to take such original ideas, andthen recklessly cobble them together with boring fight scenes andchases that we've seen a hundred times before.",Clockstoppers,PG,2002,2
187," Jill Sprecher's ""Clockwatchers,"" is my favorite type of film. It is a film that effortlessly observes characters and situations in an everyday setting, and feels as if you could be watching a documentary because it is so real.  At the start of, ""Clockwatchers,"" Iris (Toni Collette), a shy, frumpy-looking young woman, starts a job at a credit office as a temp secretary, and is able to break out of her weak shell thanks to meeting and becoming friends with three other temps at the office---the rebellious Margaret (Parker Posey), who shows Iris the ropes; Paula (Lisa Kudrow), a beautiful woman who always claims she is in the middle of acting jobs, but we sense is just trying to cover up her unhappiness; and Jane (Alanna Ubach), who is about to marry an insensitive guy who tries to buy her things everytime he does something wrong. As the film follows these four completely original and intriguing characters, an underlying story develops, involving a mystery worker at the office who is stealing the belongings of everyone else. Could one of Iris' friends be behind the crime, or is it Cleo (Helen Fitzgerald), an unusual, silent character who has just been brought into the company as vice executive?  ""Clockwatchers"" is a jewel of a film, and it was so refreshing to watch the characters and their various interactions with each other that I totally got caught up in it.   Thanks to the smart, perceptive screenplay, also written by Sprecher, and the performances by all four leads, the characters easily were able to come alive. Collette is outstanding as the repressed person in the group who slowly grows stronger as she becomes friends with the other three.

188,"Steven Spielberg is now considered as one of the Hollywooddeities, because of the rare capability to deliver both hugecommercial hits, like JURASSIC PARK, and ""Oscar""-awardedcritical triumphs like SCHINDLER'S LIST. However, in the1970s Spielberg built his reputation by creating works ofart that could slip in both categories. One of them is CLOSEENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, extremely popular andinfluential science-fiction spectacle. Unfortunately, it hada bad luck to be released in the same year as STAR WARS.Although both films have a lot in common (ground-breakingspecial effects, brilliant score by John Williams) theirfuture was different; one became an unstoppable cultphenomenon, and another almost forgotten and stuck foreverin its shadow.  When Spielberg began work on that project, he was alreadyestablished as a bright new Hollywood star due to hisprevious commercial hit, JAWS. Together with other youngdirectors of his ""New Hollywood"" generation, like Kauffman,Carpenter, Hill and Millius, he exploited the great creativefreedom of 1970s, when even the mainstream producers daredto experiment. Ironically, it was Spielberg himself whoselater commercial success would established new unwrittenrules of ""blockubuster"" philosophy. But in the mid 1970s,many things were different; Spielberg was young and eager touse Hollywood resources for his very personal and artisticmovie.  Although very personal, Spielberg's screenplay was partlybased on the book ""UFO Experience"" by Dr. J. Allen Hynek andin many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology ofextraterrestrial visitors to Earth that began to grow in theworld after WW2. Spielberg was not only inspired by themythology, but his movie also gave the mythology itself ahuge boost, unmatched until the contemporary era of X-FILESand the Roswell anniversary. That was partly because he madethe movie very realistic using the authentic UFO-relatedincidents as the element of the plot. The story begins withone of such incidents - team of international scientistscome to the Sonorra Desert in Mexico to find the U.S. Navyplanes of who went missing decades ago during the famousFlight 19. Such events coincide with the UFO incidentwitnessed by Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), power companyworker from Muncie, Indiana, who later becomes obsessed withhis experience. Because of his obsession he loses his job,family and sanity, but his loss is nothing compared to theexperience of Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), single motherwhose son becomes the victim of alien abduction. In themeantime, the scientists decipher the strange signals fromouter space and U.S. government, in co-operation with theFrench, led by Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) begin with thepreparation for ultra-secret project. When the news of thepoison gas leak in the middle of Wyoming reach Neary, hefinally sees some sense in all his visions and begins theperilous journey toward the centre of endangered area. Therehe is joined by Jillian who shared the similar visions. Twoof them must break through military pickets and reach theirdestination to find whatever is there.  Spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very sametechniques of JAWS to make completely different effects. Theslow, gradual yet very disciplined series of dramaticincidents - ""close encounters"" - is set in order to bringthe viewer to the great revelation in the finale. But,instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during theJAWS, we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder.Throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big,magnificent and wonderful is about to happen, and greatmagician Spielberg delivers his promise in the end. The lastsequence, with its, even in this age, impressive specialeffects by the great virtuoso Douglas Trumbull, would leavemany mouths open.  One of the great virtues of this film is its optimism.Aliens, who almost always get portrayed as the monsters inscience-fiction cinema, are here benevolent and harmlesscreatures and the first contact between them and humanity isa beginning of something wonderful. It is very ironic, whenwe consider that the two classic SF movies that visuallyinspired Spielberg actually told quite different story -Howard Hawks' THING and Byron Haskin's WAR OF THE WORLDSpresented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind.Spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future alsolies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era;the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-Watergateportrayal of government as conspiratorial towards thepublic. But, even such government is much more harmlesscompared to the murderous and chain-smoking Men in Blackthat became the stereotype thanks to X-FILES and its morecynical and disturbing visions.  There lies the main, and probably the only flaw of thisgreat picture - lack of conflict, and consequently, lack ofdrama. The movie has few excitements or even action scenes(especially the last that may be an interesting homage toHitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST) but generally, almosteveryone - Neary, Jillian, government, aliens - are the goodguys. Despite such shortcomings, the actors were good andmanage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles.Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary, yet niceguy, who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in agrand finale. Melinda Dillon was, on the other hand,nominated for ""Oscar"" as a struggling mother, yet she wasovershadowed by Teri Garr as Neary's long-suffering wifeRonnie. Apart from visual wonders of this film, Spielberg'ssemi-official composer John Williams again excels by hisbeautiful music, this time using the simple melody both asthe element of a plot, and as the basis for his score.  The aliens, who are the main subject of this film, werevisually very convincing. Too convincing, one of myacquaintances in the UFO-researching circles said. Accordingto him, the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinnedlittle people with big eyes was so accurate, that it managedto freak out powerful government figures interested insuppressing the truth about UFOs. So, they later approachedSpielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien,this time designed to be anything but the real life. Theresult was E.T., for many years the biggest commercial hitof all times, yet less inspirational for UFO enthusiasts.  Anyway, whether the viewer believes in existence ofextraterrestrials or UFOs, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRDKIND remains the great movie, and one of the rare upliftingexperiences in modern cinema. ",Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,PG,1977,3.5
189,"Miramax's latest annual bid for Oscar voters, ""Cold Mountain"" is alushly photographed war-torn love story with an amazing pedigree ofbig talents both behind and in front of the camera. This fact, however,turns out to be a double-edged sword for the expansive cast; whilethe actors do what they can, every role d own to the smallest is,on one level or another, filled by a recognizable face. The film stopsbeing about the characters and their personal journeys and startsbeing a guessing game as to what established star will pop up in thenext scene, spout off a half-dozen lines or so, and make their exit.It doesn't help that the central love story that is supposed to bethe major pulling force of the plot comes off as undernourished andlargely unconvincing. At almost every turn, ""Cold Mountain"" is anill-conceived adaptation of the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier. The time is 1864, as the South is dangerously close to losing theCivil War. Every day of every year that Infantryman Inman (Jude Law)has been gone from his home in North Carolina, he has managed to stayalive in order to once again see Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), a womanwhom he shared little time with but knows is his one true love. Followinga grisly battle that leaves him badly injured, Inman recuperates ina h ospital just long enough to be able to desert the war and makehis way across the North Carolina terrain back to Ada. Hot on hisheels are a group of ""home guards"" (led by Ray Winstone) who havebegun scouring the countryside in an attempt to find and kill the deserters. Meanwhile, back in the farming community of Cold Mountain, Ada hasprayed for Inman's return. Although she is unsure how someone sheonly met a few times could have such an impact on her life, she knowsthat she loves him. When Ada's beloved father (Donald Sutherland)dies, she is left with a farm that she has no idea how to run. Helparrives in the form of Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), a rugged straight-talkerwho doesn't become Ada's hired hand as much as she insists on beingtreated like an equal. As the summer season turns to winter, and theywork together on keeping the farm up to speed, Ada and Ruby developa close friendship just as they both need it most. Written and directed by Anthony Minghel la (1999's ""The Talented Mr.Ripley""), ""Cold Mountain"" has all the ingredients needed to make agreat motion picture, but it somehow never falls into place. The firstforty-five minutes are deceptive in that they actually do hint ata masterpiece in the making. Interweaving the individual moments inwhich Ada and Inman formed their love for each other before the warwith the bloody Virginia battle that becomes the turning point forInman's decision to escape something he no longer believes in, theopening act is deeply involving and randomly heartbreaking in a waythat is difficult to describe in words. The battle scene, violent,messy, and uncompromising in its portrayal, ranks as one of the mosteffective ever put on film. The sequences that set up Ada and Inman'srelationship are also remarkably well crafted, mixing poetic unspokenemotions with a level of beautifully modulated symbolism. Unfortunately, this nearly flawless setup gives way to a forthcoming 100 minutesthat disturbingly unravels at the seams before your very eyes. The two alternating story threadsInman on his quest home as he meetsa series of quirky individuals, and Ada and Ruby dealing with thefarm as they view the effects the war has had in their townare episodicand occasionally border on wacky. All of the people Inman comes intocontact with, from a sex-crazed minister (Philip Seymour Hoffman),to a kindly hermit who saves him from death (Eileen Atkins), to agrungy prostituting family, to a mournful young mother (Natalie Portman),are too colorful by a half to be believable. In a film that is setin an all-too-real time and place, the supporting characters are inappropriatein their offbeat artificiality. Back on the homefront, things fallapart at precisely the moment Ruby makes her appearance at Ada's farm.Renee Zellweger (2002's ""Chicago"") is one of the freshest and bestactresses working today, and does her best at energizing the proceedingsand giving spunk to her part. It is not Zellweger's fault, then, thatRuby is the most out of place of them all, the type of sassy, tell-it-like-it-iscomic relief that can only be found in the world of movies, and shouldnever have been in this one. She does not gel well at all with herco-stars, and certainly doesn't fit the otherwise dramatic tone of the film. Instead of building tension and hope that they will rekindle theirromance, the longer Inman and Ada are kept apart, the less power thelove story between them becomes. One of the most calamitous reasonsfor this is that Inman and Ada are bland creations, all the more sowhen standing next to the other characters, and they do not sharethe chemistry needed for the story to successfully resonate. Throughoutthe picture, Ada questions in voice-over why she has fallen so helplesslyfor a man she hardly knows, and the viewer comes to ask the same thing.Any way you shake it, the romance is limp beyond repair. As Ada, Nicole Kidman (2002's ""The Hours"") turns in one of her weakestperformances in years. Kidman isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination,but she doesn't have a firm grasp on the role. Her accent is the worstoffender; she comes off sounding like an Aussie trying to speak southernfor the first time. As Inman, Jude Law (2001's ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"")doesn't make much impact at all. The supporting cast, as previouslynoted, distractingly ham it up. Among them, only Natalie Portman (1999's""Anywhere But Here"") stands out, but her part of a lonely mother searchingfor another adult human connection is a thankless one. ""Cold Mountain"" is great for one-third of its running time, and woefullymisguided the rest of the time. The inevitable reunion between Adaand Inman should have stood as the peak moment of the filmafter all,this is what the entire picture has been building tobut it comes offas more of a whimper. There is no denying that, in bringing this literarywork to the screen, the best people in the business got involved.The sweeping cinematography by John Seale (2003's ""Dreamcatcher"")is simply gorgeous, and the sumptuous production design by Dante Ferretti(2002's ""Gangs of New York"") is superb. ""Cold Mountain"" is a technicaltriumph, to be sure, but it is just as lacking in pure soul. Everythingis too cute and impassive, and if you can't believe in the charactersand relationships put on the screen, how can you believe in the filmitself? Regrettably, not much at all.",Cold Mountain,R,2003,2.5
190,"For a summer release, one coming out amidst an onslaught of specialeffects-laden action and sci-fi films, ""Collateral"" is a challengingthriller for adults, puppeteered by classy filmmaker Michael Mann(1999's ""The Insider"") and aided by his know-how of ratcheting suspenseand intrigue out of even the most quiet of moments. There are realideas and themes explored here„the notion that human nature demandspeople to not pay attention to what doesn't concern them, the realizationthat one's lifelong dreams for the future are slipping out of theirgrasp through the cruel passages of both time and inertia„rather thanjust an excuse to parade out violence and cheap thrills in the nameof entertainment. ""Collateral"" gets all of this just right, but takesa detour in the third act that is disappointingly more conventionalthan the plot deserves. Ultimately, it concludes being less than the sum of its parts.  On a seemingly ordinary evening in Los Angeles, mild-mannered cabdriver Max (Jamie Foxx) gets a shot at fate when he picks up Annie(Jada Pinkett Smith), a beautiful and intelligent lawyer on her wayto clock in some late-night hours as she prepares for an upcomingcase. They strike up a conversation, impersonal at first but moreplayful as they get acquainted with each other, culminating with Annieoffering him her business card as a sly come-on. Almost immediatelyafterward, the sharply-dressed, gray-haired Vincent (Tom Cruise) stepsinto Max's cab, presenting him $700 if he will chauffeur him aroundthe town as he makes a few pit-stops. It is an offer Max can't refuse,and a mistake that soon has him a veritable prisoner at the handsof Vincent, a contract killer with five specific targets to do awaywith before the night is over. ""Collateral"" is an arrestingly written (by Stuart Beattie) and acteddramatic thriller that refuses to cut easy corners for the majorityof its running time. Because it is set over a single night, directorMichael Mann is all the more exacting in the way he follows thesetwo men brought together by chance„Max and Vincent„from start to finishof their unlikely relationship. The plot is nothing particularly groundbreaking,and there is a certain sinking predictability in how things are goingto turn out, but it is in Mann's slick, sharp-eyed work that enhancesthe narrative. This is not a film that is all surface; it is quicklyapparent that there are extra layers to the characters than firstmeets the eye and Mann has deeper human topics to explore. He doesthis startlingly well for most of the running time, avoiding the obviousand keeping the tone subtle and low-key.  Nevertheless, the machinations of the plot occasionally show theirseams. As killer Vincent goes from one hit to the next and Max getsfurther in over his head, practically every event that occurs canbe foretold by viewers astute on genre customs. Of course there willbe a run-in with the law, as Max must play it cool or risk havingVincent commit the murders of innocent people. And there will be thescene where, for reasons left to be discovered, Max will be forcedto pose as Vincent during one of his meetings. And then there areMax's attempts to escape, each one consistently thwarted in the process. To relieve the decided repetition, screenwriter Stuart Beattie concoctsa number of less apparent, more truthful circumstances that transcendthe formula. A stop at a hospital to visit Max's feisty mother (IrmaP. Hall) is uncharacteristically kind-hearted and tense at the sametime, as the viewer is never sure what Vincent might be capable ofif Max doesn't do as he is told. The extended opening cab scene betweenMax and Annie is so expertly conceived, natural, and charming thatit could stand as a short film all on its own. Likewise, some of theconversations between Max and Vincent dig beneath the exterior oftheir personalities, uncovering effective truths about both of them.And, finally, this is one big Hollywood production where none of thecharacters seem to be safe, no matter how high up the well-known actorsappear on the credits list. In recent years, Tom Cruise has branched out from playing things safeand heroic, a usual pitfall of big stars, to develop quite a diverseresume (1999's ""Magnolia,"" 2001's ""Vanilla Sky,"" 2003's ""The LastSumurai""). His work as Vincent, an unapologetic murderer who seeshis crimes as just another job, is intense and believable. There areno sentimental asides to Cruise's role to please his fans; Vincentis who he is (a wayward, hopeless lost soul), and Cruise straightforwardlyplays it that way. On first glance, the comedically-oriented JamieFoxx (2004's ""Breakin' All the Rules"") would appear to be an odd choiceto play opposite Cruise. It takes all of two minutes to dispel anydoubts. As Max, a cab driver who has found himself stuck in a jobhe sees no future in but can't get motivated to break free from, Foxxgives a superbly understated three-dimensional performance. Despite only getting minimal screen time (solely the first and lastten minutes), Jada Pinkett Smith (2003's ""The Matrix Reloaded"") isdynamite as Annie, making such a deep impression at the beginningthat she remains on the viewer's mind throughout the course of thestory. Pinkett Smith has never been more charismatic than she is here.The other supporting players are peripheral to the main story, withMark Ruffalo (2004's ""13 Going on 30""), Peter Berg (2001's ""CorkyRomano""), and Bruce McGill (2003's ""Matchstick Men"") as investigatorshot on Vincent's trail. Because this subplot goes nowhere, and endsup making zero impact on anything else that occurs, it could havebeen completely excised, saving twenty minutes of screen time withno damage to the finished product. The slam-bang climax, in which Max makes a desperate attempt to savethe life of Vincent's last target, is simultaneously flawless anda major letdown. From the point of view of a commercially-based thriller,it is masterful and genuinely nail-biting, certain to have you inchingtoward the end of your seat. Director Mann, editors Jim Miller (2002's""Serving Sara"") and Paul Rubell (2003's ""Peter Pan""), and cinematographersDion Beebe (2003's ""In the Cut"") and Paul Cameron (2004's ""Man onFire"") have a field day with tightly moving back and forth betweenthree different characters and their actions, playing with actualdarkness (rather than the usual movie's version of it, with lightsconveniently placed upon t he subjects), and building a wave of tensionin its wake. At the same time, the third-act plot developments failto do justice to the weighty topics that have come before, targetingfamiliar thriller-movie conventions when something more had been deserved.The final minutes end especially predictably, even if they do captureone's emotions from a visceral standpoint. When all is said and done, ""Collateral"" remains an enthralling experience,thanks to Mann's smart treatment of the material and the performers'notably strong turns. The ending, however, could have used anotherrewrite. For a motion picture that demands close audience attentionand contemplation for its first 100 minutes, the last 20 unfortunatelyrelegate toward the most commonplace of queries: who lives and whodies. You care about the outcome, even as you acknowledge the filmcould have been so much more. ",Collateral,R,2004,3
191,"In one horrifying moment, Gordy Brewer, a Los Angeles firefighter,loses both his wife and son in a terrorist attack by El Lobo (The Wolf) anotorious rebel in Colombia's on-going civil war. El Lobo's targets were membersof the Colombian consulate and CIA; the civilians were ""collateral damage,""people in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not only is Gordy devastated butwhen it becomes obvious that the US government is not going to pursue El Lobo -for political reasons - he sets out for vengeance, relentlessly tracking thekiller through the jungle to his camp. As Gordy confronts the complexphilosophical realities of Colombian guerrilla warfare, those who are squeamishshould be warned of one grossly repugnant torture scene in which a man has apoisonous snake shoved down his throat. Along the way, of course, Gordy puts hisknowledge of combustibles to work, igniting explosions, and meeting up with ElLobo's enigmatic wife (Francesca Neri) and adopted son. Written by DavidGriffiths & Peter Griffiths from an idea by Ronald Roose and directed by AndrewDavis, this saga seems somehow dated, although Arnold Schwarzenegger shows farmore sensitivity, maturity and depth than in previous films - with Elias Koteas,John Leguizamo, John Turturro and Cliff Curtis lending strong support. On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Collateral Damage"" is an action-packed 6. Gordyis supposed to be an Everyman so I kept thinking: what if a band of thefrustrated survivors of those killed on Sept. 11th made their way to the MiddleEast to exact the same kind of revenge? Would some CIA zealot support theirvigilante efforts? But this kind of movie is supposed to be mindless escapistentertainment, not a rumination on real life, right? Sadly, for me, it hit tooclose to home. ",Collateral Damage,R,2002,2.5
192,"There are some films that resemble quality wines - they getbetter with each passing year and decade. But few of themcould enjoy such favourable fate because they became morefrightening for future generations than for theircontemporaries. One of such cases is COMA, 1978 thriller byMichael Chricton. In its time, it was branded as sciencefiction by most critics, even those very familiar with thegenre. But today, nobody would dare to do it, because someof the future predictions in this film became chillinglyaccurate. Which, of course, makes this film even more scary.  The script, written also by Michael Chricton, was based onthe best-selling novel by Robin Cook, author of manysuccessful medical thrillers. The movie protagonist isDoctor Susan Wheeler (played by Genevieve Bujold), youngdoctor in big Boston hospital. During her practice, shebegins noticing a strange pattern of young and healthypatients falling into unexplained coma during the routinesurgeries. She begins to investigate, although everyone,including her boyfriend and colleague Doctor Marc Bellows(played by Michael Douglas), doesn't believe her claimsabout all those cases being connected. Actually, the causeof that phenomenon becomes even more sinister after DoctorWheeler survives an attempt on her life. Finally motivatedto push through the bitter end, she begins to reveal theshocking truth.  COMA is just another example for all those film critics oftoday who consider 1970s to be the Golden Age of worldcinema. That time period was very fruitful for many moviedirectors who had made many great films, only to deliverdisappointments in the latter decades. Michael Chricton,acclaimed novelist, screenwriter and director was one ofthem, reaching the peak of his film career in 1970s. Many,including the author of this review, would claim that COMAhappens to be his best film. One of the reason for that isCrichton's medical background that provided him anopportunity to create realistic settings and characters(same as with his hit TV-show ER two decades later). As aresult, COMA is a film with very plausible plot andconvincing characters. And the realism worked very well inorder to create extremely scary atmosphere - the hospital,institution where the people are supposed to be safer thanin all other places, is suddenly turned into place ofunimaginable horrors. The movie is even more scarier thancult horrors that used to be very popular in those days; fewpeople could imagine themselves being attacked by sharks orstalked by axe murderers and supernatural demons, but almosteveryone could expect himself to end in hospital, helplessand totally at the mercy of people in white coats. Scarinessalso sprang from the widespread feeling of post-Watergateparanoia, when every segment of the establishment, includingeven the medical profession, caused suspicion about its goodintentions or scruples.  Crichton's direction in this film is almost flawless. Hepresents the scenes of Doctor Wheeler's boring and totallyunexciting domestic and professional every day life, shot inalmost quasi-documentary fashion, and quickly replaces themwith the breath-taking scenes of suspense. Doctor Wheeler'sbattle with the assassin in the dark corridors and autopsyroom is one of those scenes that leave strong impact on theviewers. And the truth, being finally revealed in theJefferson Institute, is one of the most memorable andfrightening images in the history of cinema. The movie wasdeliberately left without original musical score for most ofits part, except in the suspense scenes, when alwaysreliable Jerry Goldsmith provides needed audio stimuli forsuspense and horror.  Acting talent in this film is excellent. Genevieve Bujoldwas very well cast as a heroine of this film. She portraysDoctor Wheeler as a liberated, professional woman of 1970s,strong and stubborn, and yet vulnerable because of herphysical limitations. In many ways she resembles SigourneyWeaver as Ripley in ALIEN, another feminist action herofaced with unspeakable horrors. The other actors mostly fillthe blanks - Michael Douglas is, at best, passable as herromantic interest. Richard Widmark is good as DoctorWheeler's mentor. The movie also shows many future stars andrespected actors like Ed Harris and Tom Selleck in smallroles, although the latter one looks rather lame.  That wasn't the only flaw of this film. The plot worked verywell until the very end, with the unexpected plot twistwhich had reduced Doctor Wheeler from the heroine intotypical ""damsel in distress"". And the ending was rather weakand not too cathartic. But that plot twist at the end wasalso an opportunity for the authors to allow some of thecharacters to explain the ethical challenges - the basis forthe plot premise. That same premise looked preposteroustwenty years ago, but today, it is taken for granted as asad fact of life. Perhaps that, more than everything else,makes this film so scary and so effective after all thoseyears. ",Coma,PG,1978,3
193,"One of the things that should make movie fans less nostalgic about 1980saren't ""teenage slasher"" horrors. The real killers among products ofmovie industry in that decade were so-called ""ramboids"", movies inspiredby the meteoric success of Stallone's FIRST BLOOD PART 2. That storyabout lone U.S. Special Forces man that manages to single-handedlydestroy entire Vietnamese army was the product of Reagan years andactually served as a substitute for U.S. victory in Vietnam War.However, Stallone's stunts in that film inspired hundreds of cheapimitations - usually such cinematic abominations that would needcenturies before they get any chance of camp appeal. ""Ramboids"" weren'tjust monstrosities in artistic sense - in case of former Yugoslavia theyactually proved the theory of movies as a bad influence on real lifepeople. After being exposed to hundreds of movies with heroes who, armedwith single machinegun or a rocket launcher, manage to wipe out entireregiments of bad guys, many young people considered war to be fun and in1991, when war erupted in Croatia, they actually volunteered go to thebattlefields in droves. For many rude awakening about world wherebullets don't miraculously miss good guys, where automatic weapons haveto be re-loaded and where superior firepower, training and numbersactually do matter came too late. Thousands, perhaps even tens ofthousands of people in body bags or wheelchairs could be counted as aindirect victims of movies inspired by RAMBO 2.  The only ""ramboid"" that I actually liked, and, I still like, causingcertain feeling of guilt about it, is COMMANDO by Mark L. Lester, one ofthose rare big studio projects that jumped on RAMBO 2 bandwagon.Actually, it proved to be quite succesful vehicle for rising star ofArnold Schwarzenegger and one of the most popular action movies in thatdecade (that would later bring such a masterpieces as PREDATOR and DIEHARD).  The hero of the movie is Colonel John Matrix, veteran of a unnamed U.S.Special Operations unit, who has retired and lives a happy and quietlife as a logger together with his pre-teen daughter Jenny. The idylliclife is interrupted by a bunch of thugs, including his formerpsychopatic subordinate Bennet, who kidnap his daughter. The move wasorchestrated by Arius, exiled dictator of a remote Latin Americancountry who wants to return to power and Matrix must kill the sittingpresident in a exchange for his daughter's life. However, knowing thathe deals with anything but an honest people he escapes from ascendingplane, knowing that he has only 11 hours before the plane lands andArius finds that he changed his mind. Matrix begins the race against thetime and tries to find the location of terrorist base, with theattractive stewardess Cindy as his only help.  One of the reason why COMMANDO beats RAMBO 2 is in a approach. Whiledirector Pal Cosmatos, writer James Cameron and Stallone usedimpressive, but utterly unrealistic visual and other attractions of""one- man-army"" concept as a tool for certain political message,Schwarzenegger, writer Steven E. De Souza (author of DIE HARD) anddirector Mark L. Lester (whose work on COMMANDO is probably his best)considered all that special forces mumbo-jumbo as an excuse for escapistpulp fiction fun. Schwarzenegger, who had already created an image ofinvincible hero/killing machine in CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1981) and THETERMINATOR (1984) actually tried to give some new elements to his owncharacter (East German background as an attempt to give plausibleexplanation for his accent). But, he also finished the creation of hison-screen Schwarzenegger personality, including his famous one-linersand very specific, sometimes very cruel sense of humour. His lines,usually given before the killing of the bad guys, are probably the bestremembered element of this movie.  Almost everything in this movie is deliberately over the top. That alsoincludes the small army of brilliant character actors in the roles ofArius and his henchmen. Vernon Welles, who was, until that time bestknown as Mad Max's nemesis in THE ROAD WARRIOR is, despite his hugephysical presence, overshadowed by Bill Duke and Dan Hedaya. But hisfinal showdown with Schwarzenegger is quite impressive, anyway. The goodguys are under-represented (small roles of Bill Paxton and ChelseaFields are almost un-noticeable), but Rae Dawn Chong as Cindy,displaying entertaining combination of ""damsel in distress"" and toughchick that gives this movie brilliant comic relief.  COMMANDO is hardly a masterpiece, suffering mostly from the uninspiredsoundtrack by James Horner (mostly re-write of his work in 48 HRS) andthe song that beats Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" in ""thecheasiest song of all times"" category. Editing is sub-par in the finalshowdown scenes, but only the most fanatical nitpickers would find suchfatal flaws. In its 90 minutes of non-stop action, COMMANDO manages toachieve its goal - to entertain the audience. And, sometimes, that factis enough to consider the movie good. ",Commando,R,1985,3
194,"Psst.  If you can keep it a secret, I can now reveal some of what reallyhappened just before the infamous Bay of Pigs.  I found out the inside storyat COMPANY MAN, an over-the-top comedy that is so intentionally ""bad,"" it'shilarious.  Think of it as the movie that BATTLEFIELD EARTH should havebeen.  Or, perhaps more aptly, think of it as a history lesson in thedeliciously wacky AIRPLANE! style.   Whatever it is, the movie, jointly written and directed by Douglas McGrath(EMMA) and Peter Askin, will have you laughing loudly and often.  Moresophisticated viewers will undoubtedly engage in a bit of revisionisthistory afterwards as some critics did at our screening, claiming that itwas actually a terrible movie and that their laughs were merely those ofderision.  If a comedy rates high on my laugh-o-meter, that's enough for me.I don't care what devious means it employees to produce the guffaws. As the story opens in 1962, the worlds most pedantic grammarian, Allen Quimp(McGrath), is testifying behind closed doors to a select congressionalcommittee led by an incredulous senator (Jeffrey Jones from FERRIS BUELLER'SDAY OFF).  Congress wants to know how an English and Driver's Ed teacher wassent to Cuba as an undercover agent for the CIA.  (Remember, you're sworn tosecrecy.) Although Allen is the author of the 854-page book modestly titled, ""TheGrammar Crisis in the English Speaking World,"" he needs something else toimpress his relatives, which include a Nobel Prize winner and an astronaut,so he decides to be a ""company man"" at the CIA.  Since he ""knows a littleRussian"" -- not the language but a small Russian man -- he figures that heis the right guy for the CIA.  The Russian turns out to be none other thanworld-renowned Russian ballerina Rudolph Petrov (Ryan Phillippe), who tellsAllen, ""I wish to defecate -- I mean defect."" Allen ends up being inducted into the CIA and shipped off to an obscure,third world island, Cuba, where his superiors figure that there is no chancethat he could get into any trouble.  Once there, his obsession with perfectsyntax and semantics drives fellow agent Fry (Denis Leary) nuts.  ""There'sno use in winning the war against Communism if we lose the war against thedouble negative,"" Allen admonishes Fry.  About to go stark raving mad, Frytells him, ""I've only said one sentence since you arrived, and you've beencorrecting it ever since."" Indicative of the wild level of the comedy is the casting of Woody Allen asthe CIA station chief.  The producers managed to find a cryogenically frozenWoody from his wonderfully crazy, early comedies like BANANAS and defrosthim.  No signs of the angst-filled later Woody are present.   Also along for the ride is Sigourney Weaver, showing off the comedic talentthat she displayed as the computer operator in GALAXY QUEST.  This time sheplays Daisy Quimp, the agent's wife, who is planning on getting rich bywriting a book about their time in the CIA.  When Fidel Castro (AnthonyLaPaglia) starts his revolution against General Batista (Alan Cumming), shewants her husband to overthrow the revolution in ""the most readable waypossible.""  The superlative cast for COMPANY MAN never seems to stop.  Ihalf expected Tom Cruise to pop by the set for a cameo.  Everybody elseseems to have dropped by. The press kit details some of the actual failed attempts by the CIA againstCastro.  The writers use variations on them in the script.  My personalfavorite involves a scheme in the movie to spike Castro's shampoo in orderto ""defoliate his face.""  Nothing like a defoliated face to demoralize arevolutionary. COMPANY MAN runs a fast 1:35.  It is rated PG-13 for brief sexual humor anddrug content, but it is so mild that it's basically PG.  With the exceptionof one ribald scene during the ending credits, the film would be acceptablefor almost all kids, but kids probably need to be 11 or 12 to be able toappreciate the film's humor.",Company Man,PG-13,2001,3
195,"      Welcome to the silly season.  It's summer, and every weekendbrings a new hundred million dollar action movie.  (Some price tagsbeing slightly less.)  Serious movies avoid the heat of summer whenpeople's brains are fried.  This diminution of mental capacity causesmovie goers to flock to blockbusters promising even louder explosionsthan the film the week before.       Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, whose middle name must be ""excess,""last year gave us THE ROCK.  Remember the car chase in it that feltlike it was on a Moebius strip and would never end?  Well, that wassubtle filmmaking compared to the fireworks style extravaganza thatends his latest picture CON AIR.  Of course, that part is set in thetown that loves people who overindulge -- Las Vegas.  The worst part ofthe conclusion is that when you breathe a slight of relief that thisrepetitive and overly long film is finally over, it isn't.       But I am getting ahead of myself.  As one who has sat through CONAIR, it is easy to dwell on the ending credits since that means you canleave.  Still, along the way, Scott Rosenberg's script does have manygood one-liners to amuse us, and CON AIR works best as a comedy.You've seen all of the stunts and special effects before so there islittle left to focus on other than the acting, which stays at the comicbook level, and the dialog.       I kept thinking that if their budget were cut in half, they wouldhave made a better picture.  If the special effects department were puton a much stricter budget, the show might have had to develop thecharacters beyond caricature.       A frequent complaint about movies is that the villain is notstrong enough, but here the movie is populated by a plethora of badguys.  ""The worst of the worst"" prisoners are being transported on thea U. S. Marshal's airplane, which the inmates nickname Con Air (ConvictAirlines), to a new maximum security prison.  The U. S. Marshal incharge is Vince Larkin (John Cusack from GROSS POINTE BLANK), whoquotes Dostoevski and talks like a walking thesaurus.       The hero of the picture is Cameron Poe played by Nicolas Cage, thegreat character actor from LEAVING LAS VEGAS who seems to be slummingby taking this part.  Eight years ago, ex-Army Ranger Cameron killed aman trying to harm his pregnant wife Tricia, played with fashion modelbeauty by Monica Potter.  Cameron is about to be paroled and ishitching his way back on Con Air for his release.       This flight is transporting every manner of criminal including aHannibal Lecter clone named Garland ""The Marietta Mangler"" Greene,played by Steve Buscemi in a horrible bit of miscasting.  One con tellsus that ""the way he killed the people, he made the Manson Family looklike the Partridge Family.""  Get the point.  These guys are bad, bad,bad.  Or as Cameron puts it, ""Somehow they managed to get every creepand freak in the universe on this one plane.""       The leader of the convicts, Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom, is playedby John Malkovich in his perennial slime ball, intellectual role.""Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally insane,"" according toLarkin.       As the plane is being loaded, Larkin assures his coworker thatthere is no reason to worry about the operation.  ""This is a well oiledmachine,"" he tells her.  ""All we have to worry about is stale peanutsand a little bit of turbulence.""  For the three people in the world whohaven't seen the trailers and know nothing of the movie, this line is atip off that all hell is about to break loose.       If you want to have fun in the picture, bring a pad and keep acount of the story's illogical aspects.  My favorite involves thenumber of guns the guards take on board the plane to protectthemselves.  Want to venture a guess?  It's one little pistol that thepilot keeps in a locked box in the cockpit.  When the inevitable breakoccurs in mid-air, the lack of guns becomes a severe handicap for theguards.  But boy-oh-boy do lots of people die anyway.       In order to appeal to women, the movie was supposedly softened upby Cage's adding little family touches like his stuffed bunny.  (At akey point, Cyrus actually threatens Cameron with ""Make a move and thebunny gets it!"")  Disney is marketing the film's almost non-existentlove story angle in an attempt to broaden the demographics of theaudience.  Even religion enters the picture when Cameron tells hisdying buddy, ""I'm going to show you that God does exist.""       Like a roulette player that plays it safe by betting on all thenumbers, this movie does not miss anything.  Did I mention that thereis a transvestite named ""Sally Can't Dance"" (Renoly), a black militantnamed Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames), and a tattooed rapistnamed John ""Johnny 23"" Baca (Danny Trejo)?  Johnny has 23 counts ofrape but brags the real number is 600.       Although I had fun listening to the dialog, the show is purebalderdash and about as imaginative as Saturday morning cartoons.  Arock 'em, sock 'em, meaningless time at the movies.       CON AIR runs 1:55.  It is rated R for strong violence andlanguage.  The violence was cartoonish enough so that the film isprobably acceptable for most teenagers.  I cannot recommend the showalthough I did laugh often enough to give it **. ",Con Air,R,1997,2.5
196,"Disparity between popular and critically acclaimed moviesisn't something that should catch any reviewer by surprise.On the other hand, sometimes things get a little bitpersonal. In my case, I was puzzled by the low rating of amovie I consider one of my favourite masterpieces of seventhart. CONAN THE BARBARIAN by John Millius is, in humbleopinion of this author, one of the top ten motion picturesever made. However, whenever I mention that movie to theaverage moviegoer, they show either disdain, ignorance orindifference.  Unenviable status of CONAN THE BARBARIAN among movie loverspuzzled me for years. At the beginning I was close to theconclusion that I had been trying to find artisticjustification for my ultimate ""guilty pleasure"". However,years passed and my movie taste developed enough for me todistinguish true art from commercial trash, but my affectionfor CONAN stayed the same. Finally, I was beginning to makemy own pet theory about Millius' masterpiece and that theorycan be summed up in a phrase ""wrong time"".  However, it looked like a good time for Dino de Laurentiis,Italian movie producer who saw mega-success of Donner'sSUPERMAN as an impulse to start making his own movieadaptations of popular comic books. His previous attempt inthat direction, FLASH GORDON, was successful despite beingchewed by critics, then allergic to 1970s camp.Unfortunately, when De Laurentiis decided to make anothercomic book adaptation he chose the wrong hero.  Unlike squeaky clean characters of Superman, Flash Gordon oreven Buck Rogers, Conan the Barbarian actually didn't belongto G-rated world of simple morality virtues of late 1930sand early 1940s. His character was indeed invented in 1930s,but the dark imagination of tragically deceased authorRobert E. Howard (1906- 1936) kept Conan outside pulpfiction mainstream. It was only in 1960s when, thanks to L.Sprague de Camp and other authors, Conan was rediscoveredand later served as some kind of adult alternative toTolkien-inspired stereotypes in fantasy genre. However,Conan reached the peak of its popularity in the media ofcomic books, using the new standards of depictions of sexand violence in order to make his character popular amongmale teeenagers.  De Laurentiis knew that the campy and ironic approachtowards Conan's character wouldn't work. So, he needed somereal 1970s author to deal with 1970s phenomenon. The choicefell on John Millius, one of the biggest names in so-called""New Hollywood"" of 1970s. Millius was perfect, because thevision of Conan as lonely but free character in amoral worldwas in line with Millius' own individualistic andlibertarian views.  According to many Conan purists, the plot is inconsistentwith the ""canon"" of Conan novels and comic books. In otherway, it uses many of Conan stories in order to make thestory both original and faithful to the works of Robert E.Howard.  The story begins in time of Conan, some 12000 yearsB.C. when the continents of Africa, Europe and Asia weresingle land mass, and when many ancient but corruptcivilizations shared the space with barbarian tribes. One ofsuch tribes becomes target of a raiders led by evil sorcerorand demigod Thulsa Doom (Jones) who kill all the adults andtake children into slavery. One of those children is Conanwho, thanks to years of hard work, grows up to be muscularand extremely strong slave. Such qualities later lead him tothe career of gladiator, and, after earning freedom from hismaster, he begins his personal crusade for revenge. Thequest leads him to the city of Zamora where he strikesfriendship with thieves Subotai (Lopez) and beautifulValeria (Bergman). After succesfully stealing jewels fromthe Temple of Snake, they are approached by old King Osric(Von Sydow), whose own daughter (Quenessen) became thefollower of Thulsa Dooom, now the leader of growing anddangerous cult on the way to global domination. Conanaccepts the offer to return the Princess to King, althoughhis friends doubt his real motives.  >From the perspective of an average moviegoer, who expectedsome escapist mind- blowing adventure, CONAN THE BARBARIANmight have been a disappointment or mediocre piece of work.Instead of an adventure, the movie is an epic story wherethe plot and characters tend to be more important than thevisual and other attractions. However, the movie doesn'tlack those attractions - there are fewer action sequencesthan in an average action/average movie, but they arebeautifully shot and choreographed. Also, the movie authorspaid great attention towards detail, in a quantitiesunpreccedented from von Stroheim's time. Although the worldof Conan is fictious, the Millius cleverly portrayed it asmythical vision of Bronze/Iron Age Europe, using many actualhistoric details of that, in Hollywood movies generallyignored, time period. Amounts of blood, gore, sex and nuditythat may be gratuitous in any other film , here,paradoxically, give great deal of historical realism to thefilm that is basically a mythical fantasy. But the biggestattraction of all is Basil Poledouris' musical score, sobeautiful and perfect, that even some of the biggest criticsconsider it one of the best in history of cinema.  The acting attractions are very few, but there are somewonderful parts. CONAN THE BARBARIAN is now mostlyremembered as Arnold Schwarzenegger's first major movierole, that later catapulted his career. Although the futurestar received one of first ""Razzie"" anti-awards for hisperformances, I must say that his role in CONAN is perhapsthe best in his career. He didn't just worked hard to makehis character as physically identical to Conan as possible,but emotionally as well. His role is quite serious, andlacks one-liners that would later become Schwarzenegger'strademark. Schwarzenegger's acting partners in this movieweren't that lucky in their later career. James Earl Joneswas probably most successful of them all, and it's thrillingto see him here in atypical but brilliant portrayal of theultimate bad guy. Apart from Max von Sydow, almost everyoneelse - Gerry Lopez,  Sandahl Bergman and Valerie Quenessen -sailed to oblivion, although their parts were adequate atworst.  Apart from the major misunderstanding between the commercialaudience and artistically ambitious movie creators, CONANTHE BARBARIAN suffers from another, more serious problems inhis approach towards viewers. Some critics are prone toappraise this film not on its artistic merit, but on its,sometimes questionable, ideology. Screenplay was written byOliver Stone in his best screeenwriting years, but also in aperiod before his attempts to become cinematic conscience ofAmerica, and for some, his referrences to Nietzschephilosophy are enough to brand the screenplay fascistoid.Portrayal of Thulsa Doom's cult in a movie might beinterpreted as influenced by Nietzsche's unflattering viewson Christianity, thus making movie more anti-Christian thansome more harmless but more hyped cases (like LASTTEMPTATION OF CHRIST, for example). However, John Milliuswas definitely more involved in the screenplay, andpolitical overtones were lost or hidden behind Millius' ownindividualistic philosophy. Anyway, even if the movie doeshave some hidden ""message"", that message wouldn't preventmature viewer to enjoy in a cinematic masterpiece that isvery rare to find these days. ",Conan the Barbarian,R,1982,4
197,"Movies about con-artists and the heists they attempt to pull off area dime a dozen, so overexposed it takes great skill and imaginationto make one of these things worth sitting through. Despite not beinga fan of 2001's similar ""The Score"" and even more similar ""Heist,""where, once again, the tired conventions of the genre reared theirugly heads, at least they brought occasional suspense to the table.As cliched as most heist sequences are, if they are edited and performedjust right, and the director under the helm knows what he or she isdoing, then tension can be milked for all it's worth. ""Confidence,"" directed by James Foley (1999's ""The Corrupter"") andwritten by Doug Jung as if they were David Mamet's less-talented brothers,plays its con games out like an instruction manual that, for all itsbig words and fancy lettering, isn't very informative and far fromarresting. Without the brief stylish interludes that pop up everynow and again, the film is a tedious and twisting slog that, by theend, closes its fist on thin air. There is not a moment of true depth--character,narrative, or otherwise--in a single frame of this 98-minute waste of time. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a slick and sneaky con man who, at thebeginning, has found himself in hot water: he is being held at gunpointby a mystery man named Travis (Morris Chestnut). Enter the elongatedflashback motif, as Jake explains how he has found himself in thisdire situation. The head honcho of a scam group that includes youngplayer Miles (Brian Van Holt), wise guy Gordo (Paul Giamatti), andthe undervalued Big Al (Louis Lombardi), Jake makes the mistake ofchoosing a bad mark that leaves Big Al dead and their $150,000 takebelonging to the underground crime boss known as King (Dustin Hoffman).To make amends and pay their debt, King picks a new mark for Jakeand the gang--bank owner Morgan Price (Robert Forster), worth $5 millionin cold hard cash. Aiding in the heist is Lupus (Franky G.), one ofKing's men, and sultry pickpocket Lily (Rachel Weisz), whom Jake isuncontrollably smitten with. Meanwhile, possibly crooked federal agentGunthar Butan (Andy Garcia) is hot on their trail. Continuing with the similes, ""Confidence"" is like a factory conveyerbelt, and the viewer is put in the position of being the tired employeewho must see the same thing go past them again and again and again.Whatever fun is to be had in a heist caper comes from one of two sources:the unpredictable skewering of expectations, or the involved and excitingdepiction of the crime itself. ""Confidence"" does nothing to live upto the former trait, and the latter--for all of its twists and turns--isstrictly by-the-numbers, unable to even once ratchet up a sense of nervous fun.  Had the characters been worth caring about, sympathetic or at leastrudimentarily developed, then the climactic proceedings would havegiven off the vital feeling that something was at stake. Ultimately,the screenwriting creations posing as real people are vaguely drawntypes. Jake is the leader, the most talented con man who, nonetheless,knows when enough is enough and things are getting too risky. Lilyis the stock sexy female role, there to look innocent and then guilty,and then innocent again. Edward Burns (2002's ""Life or Something LikeIt"") and Rachel Weisz (2002's ""About a Boy"") fit well into these roles,but are unchallenged by the material. The rest of the gang are nearlyinterchangeable. Only King, played with deliciously threatening and""hypersensitive"" energy by Dustin Hoffman (2002's ""Moonlight Mile""),has any sort of creative nuances. There are plot developments in the conclusion that are unforeseen,to be sure, but they are equally unsurprising. The characters flip-flopsides so much in the last fifteen minutes that viewers may get whiplash,but aside from possible physical injury, they likely won't care oneway or the other. ""Confidence"" wants to be hip, wants to be sexy,and wants to be wickedly tricky, but it is all for nothing. Thereis a vacuous, dull-witted black hole at the center of this film'severy move, and victim sucked into it are the unlucky viewers.",Confidence,R,2003,2.5
198,"      It can now be revealed.  A cabal of screenwriters are toiling awayin the basements of their Hollywood mansions with a scheme to sap thebrainpower of our nation by dumbing down American movies.  As proofthat this conspiracy exists, consider as evidence the script by BrianHelgeland for the new Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts picture, CONSPIRACYTHEORY.  Helgeland's previous works include such intellectual tour deforces as NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4, 976-EVIL, HIGHWAY TO HELL, andASSASSINS.       The packed audience at the advanced screening of CONSPIRACY THEORYbecame almost outraged at the picture.  Serious lines generated massivelaughter because they were simultaneously ridiculous and stilted.  Atone point, a guy shouted an insult about the picture's quality and theaudience broke into applause.       In Warner Brothers's defense, the project must have soundedpromising when the producers, Lauren Shuler-Donner and Joel Silver,pitched it to them.  The producers had a successful director, RichardDonner, two big stars, Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, and a promisingpremise.  Donner, who directed Gibson in all of the LETHAL WEAPONfilms, would use Gibson's ability to create quirky characters tomaximum advantage.  Gibson would be a conspiracy theory kook namedJerry Fletcher, who has some serious but unexplained mental problems.       The film opens promisingly and stays that way for the first tenminutes.  Seeing just that part and then leaving is the winningstrategy for this film since the quality goes straight downhill as soonas Patrick Stewart appears on the scene in the overwritten andoveracted role of Dr. Jonas, a psychiatrist in a secret part of our""spook"" community.  (In one of the film's more laughable bad snippetsof dialog, one of the agents describes the organization saying, ""If theintelligence community is a family, think of us as the uncle no onetalks about."")       In the beginning, we learn many of the theories concocted by JerryFletcher, an especially bizarre New York City taxi driver: The new $100bills have tiny transmitters.  NASA is angry over budget cuts so theyare sending a space shuttle to cause an earthquake that will kill thepresident on his upcoming trip to Turkey.  The Vietnam War was foughtover a bet that Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis.  And to makesure he is current on all the latest theories of others, he listens towhat sounds like Conspiracy Talk Radio.  On it we find that Jack Rubydid not kill Lee Harvey Oswald since it was not Ruby who fired theshots and the person killed was only someone who looked like Oswald.       Julia Roberts, who should have worn a dunce cap on her head forall of the unbelievable things she was called upon to say and do, playsAlice Sutton, a member of the Justice department.  In the first of manyimplausible aspects of the story, we learn that her last case was theinvestigation into the murder of her own father, a judge.  Alice walksinto dark buildings loaded with heavily armed rogue agents ready tokill her, but neither takes weapons nor calls for help.  She trustspeople who have ""bad guy"" tattooed on their forehead.  And she is notthe least bit scared when a mental case like Fletcher brandishes a biggun at her and two cops.  The latter happened not long after she hadsaid of Fletcher, ""This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen,""since he followed her so obsessively.       Speaking of obsessive.  Fletcher lives in a metal-lined secretroom.  His door has four locks, his refrigerator one and even thecoffee beans and the grapefruit juice inside the fridge are in lockedcontainers.       After this setup, the aforementioned Dr. Jonas, creeps onto thescene.  In a surreal sequence modelled after the interrogation scenefrom 1984, Dr. Jonas questions Fletcher while his eyes are taped openand bright strobe lights drive him and the audience crazy.  Finally,borrowing from CHINATOWN, Fletcher tries to bite off the doctor's nose.Bloods oozes out of Fletcher's mouth in a gory image that adds nothingother than shock value.       In a film with more low points than Death Valley, two stand out asmuch worse than the others.  When Fletcher escapes, Dr. Jonas andcompany track him down with their computers.  Since Fletcher is knownto like ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" the spook's computers scan constantlyfor anyone in New York City buying a copy of the novel.  As soon assomeone does, they send a large assassination team to capture thebuyer, who conveniently turns out to be Fletcher.  There is even ashiny black helicopter that flies down one of Manhattan's main streetsand drops a squad of killers from ropes onto a busy intersection.       The film's other ""delight"" is the explanation of the mysterysurrounding Fletcher that Dr. Jonas gives to Alice.  Contrived would bethe most charitable thing that can be said of this part of the plot.       Editor Frank J. Urioste exercises little self-control.  Manypointless scenes are left in and others are allowed to go on way pasttheir welcome.  The result is a film as tedious as it is ridiculous.       Yes, Virginia, there is a conspiracy.  And this show is but one ofmany that prove the theory.       CONSPIRACY THEORY runs far too long at 2:15.  It is rated R forgore and profanity.  The film would be fine for most teenagers.  I donot recommend the movie and give it * 1/2 only for the two good leadingperformances in an awful movie. ",Conspiracy Theory,R,1997,2.5
199,"In Washington, duplicity runs deep.  But, in THE CONTENDER, the extremelyimpressive second feature film by writer and director Rod Lurie(DETERRENCE), there is at least one politician for whom principles are moreimportant than politics, even if her integrity costs her the honor of beingthe nation's first female vice president.  Speaking of honors, expect to seethis political thriller and morality tale garner many well deserved Oscarnominations including, but not limited to, Best Actress (Joan Allen) andBest Supporting Actor (Gary Oldman). Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is a Republican turned Democrat andan avowed atheist.  She may not believe in God, but she certainly has anunfailing commitment to her principles.  ""Principles only mean something ifyou stick to them when it's inconvenient,"" she explains with uttersincerity.  She may or may not be the next vice president, and it is heradherence to her principles that seems likely to come between her and thejob she so desires.   Allen, in a consistently strong performance, neverlets Senator Hanson dissolve into self-righteousness.  She gives asympathetic performance that doesn't require sympathy to admire. The elected vice president died six weeks ago, so President Jackson Evans(Jeff Bridges) has to choose a successor.  Knowing that 300 FBI agentsinvestigated Nelson Rockefeller, the only other vice presidentialreplacement, President Evans wants to make his choice carefully.  But it'smore than that.  Six years into office, the president views the choice ashis ""swan song.""   The sharply written script mixes heavy drama with sweet comedy.  Thepresident, for example, not having to run again, is kicking back and reallyenjoying the trappings of his office.  He brags that he can order absolutelyanything he wants 24 hours a day, and he can never stump his chef.  He evenhas a bowling ball with the presidential seal engraved on it, which he usesin his own private bowling alley.  It's a great life, and he's making themost of it.  Bridges's charismatic performance is full of nuances andsubtlety that leaves us never quite sure of his motivations. As the story opens, popular Senator Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen)seems to be the likely nominee, especially after his daring attempted rescueof a girl whose car goes into the lake near where he is fishing.Surprisingly, the President brushes his candidacy aside, claiming thatsomeone might decide that his heroism was actually another Chappaquidickepisode.  This sets up Senator Hathaway to be the shadow candidate for thoseopposed to the president's eventual nominee, Senator Hanson. The president's long-time nemesis, Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman),ends up chairing the nomination hearings.  Looking like a nerdish version ofRoberto Benigni (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL), Runyon's body shakes nervously and hisupper lip perspires profusely when he presides over his committee.  Thecongressman is at once utterly polite and completely devious.  When heuncovers a college sex scandal involving Senator Hanson, he salivates at thepossibilities and doesn't shy away.  He and his fellow conspirators brag tothemselves that they are going ""to obliterate a life.""  Runyon's wifeworries, with good reason, that ""he will go down as a second-rate JoeMcCarthy.""  No matter how unlikable Runyon becomes, Oldman never lets himdissolve into caricature. In a great, one-dimensional part, Sam Elliott plays Kermit Newman, thepresident's hard-nosed Chief of Staff.  When the scandal breaks, Newmanscreams his demands.  He wants dirt on Runyon, immediately: ""Little boys,midgets, cows,"" whatever they can find.  His approach, however, isn't theone that Senator Hanson feels comfortable with.  She wants to talk nothingbut policy at her hearings -- the usual liberal litany of ban all handguns,abolish the death penalty and guarantee a woman's right to choose.  Shespecifically refuses to dignify with any response the accusation that she""put on a sex show"" in college.  After all, she reasons, if she were a man,no one would care about how many women she had slept with in college. All of the casting in this ensemble effort is terrific.  Christian Slater isgood as a naive and ambitious young congressman who, in a career enhancingattempt, negotiates his way onto the nominating committee.  Like a minnowswimming with sharks, he seems in constant danger. Lurie's staging is masterful, even if sometimes a bit over the top.

200," Since 1975's ""Nashville,"" an American masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made, Robert Altman has proven that he is a world-class filmmaker. Although his career since then has been noticably uneven, he always manages to come out on top, and in the last decade has made several successful motion pictures, including ""The Player,"" ""Short Cuts,"" and even ""The Gingerbread Man."" His latest film, the southern-based dark comedy ""Cookie's Fortune,"" which gained a lot of buzz at this year's Sundance Film Festival, unfortunately falls into Altman's pile of disappointments (joining the likes of the inane ""Ready to Wear""), and probably is his biggest misfire I've seen.  Set in the humble, little town of Holly Springs, Mississippi, Cookie (Patricia Neal) is an elderly and grieving widower who has several relatives nearby, none of which much seem to bother visiting her, and whose only actual friend is Willis (Charles S. Dutton), a kindly black man who lives with her to keep her company. Easter is quickly approaching, and when her two nieces, the kooky, determined Camille (Glenn Close), who is the director of the church's violent holiday play of ""Salome,"" by Orson Welles, and the dim-witted, flaky Cora (Julianne Moore), drop by, they are horrified to discover Cookie dead in her upstairs bedroom, the victim of a suicide. Stating that suicide will not be permitted in their family, the quick-thinking Camille immediately brainwashes Cora into telling the police Cookie was murdered, and then goes about destroying evidence (she literally eats the suicide note) and setting up a ""murder scene."" Soon, however, the planted gun happens to contain the fingerprints of Willis, who is taken to the town's jail by the reluctant cops, who keep the cell door wide open and set up a game of Scrabble for him to play. Hearing word that her best buddy is in the slammer, Cora's tough 19-year-old daughter, Emma (Liv Tyler), becomes Willis' jail partner, taking time out only to make out with her ""iffy"" cop boyfriend (Chris O'Donnell).   There are two many obvious problems in ""Cookie's Fortune"" to count, but many that can't be ignored. The ensemble cast that Altman has gotten for this film is truly exceptional, but (aside from Dutton and Tyler) every single one of them is burdened with an annoyingly one-note character that isn't given any chance to grow within the nearly eventless 2-hour running time. Amid all of the ""charming"" eccentricities, all signs of realistic or even human characteristics have been abandoned for blatant caricatures that quickly test the viewer's nerves. In a film in which the majority of characters are related in some way, there is no excuse for the amount of relationships that aren't the least bit explored, or even given one scene, particularly between mother and daughter Cora and Emma, who have all of one scene together and one line exchange. Similar and far superior films in the ""Southern eccentricity"" genre are 1989's ""Miss Firecracker"" and 1997's ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."" It's been at least a year since I've viewed both of these movies, but they are more fresh in my mind, and certainly more memorable, than ""Cookie's Fortune"" which, as I write this, I saw about an hour ago.  It's a shame, too, because the performances are the central saving grace (which isn't nearly enough to save any graces at all concerning this movie). Since Dutton and Tyler are given the two fully-realized roles in the piece, their performances easily stand out, making the most out of what is certainly a lackluster screenplay, by Anne Rapp. Julianne Moore is the most lovable character in the bunch, mostly because of her genuine naivety. Ultimately, she is turned into the main comic relief and is forced to stand at a distance from the material. Glenn Close also is fine here, but too off-beat by a half for us to get involved or care at all about her, even though, I suspect, she wasn't meant to be particularly likable. Chris O'Donnell sleepwalks through his first film in two years (since the disasterous ""Batman and Robin""), but it isn't his fault that he pretty much is put in a corner with nothing to do but occasionally kiss Tyler. Courtney B. Vance shows up three-fourths of the way into the film as a crime investigator and comes off as nothing more than an afterthought, as does Lyle Lovett, as Tyler's boss and friend at her fish hatchery job.  By the time ""Cookie's Fortune"" reached its climax which, to say the least, leaves something to be desired, I was left with one nagging question: what was the point? The movie is rarely funny, straining for laughs that no doubt sounded better on paper than in actual film form; there is no human interest, or any sort of interest at all, in the story; and very little at all comes to satisfying closure. Unlike Altman's ""Nashville"" or ""The Player,"" ""Cookie's Fortune"" has nothing at all to say about anything, hoping that utter wackiness will be enough to salvage the proceedings. It isn't. Not by a long shot. ",Cookie's Fortune,PG-13,1999,2.5
201,"Every now and then film viewers are looking forward to certaintitles simply because it have something that most of the other filmsat the time lack. The author of this review must admit that he hadexpected much from COOL WORLD, 1992 part-animated fantasydirected by Ralph Bakshi. This movie was shot as a combination oflive action and animation, the protagonist was an artist and, finally,the rating was PG-13 and thus indicated cartoon more adult andless formulaic in comparison with best known animated films of1980s and 1990s.  Protagonist of COOL WORLD is Jack Deebs (played by GabrielByrne), comic book artist who leaves jail. His best work is ""CoolWorld"", comic book series about fantasy world populated by""doodles"" and humanoids a.k.a. ""noids"". After few bizarreincidents Deebs would find out that Cool World indeed exists as aparallel reality and that one of their scientists found a way totransport characters into our world. Things get even morecomplicated for Deebs when he meets Holly Would (played by KimBasinger), animated character in the form of sex bomb that wantsto become real human being.  COOL WORLD is a huge disappointment, especially when weconsider that the problem of interaction between live action andanimated characters was solved by Zemeckis in WHO FRAMEDROGER RABBIT four years earlier. Bakshi, on the other hand,lacked ability to make this interaction credible or bound by somesort of ""rules"" that are supposed to exist in fantasy world. Theresult is complete mess - the tone of the film is schizophrenic, tornbetween Bakshi's attempts to make this film more adult (eroticismin this film is very explicit for Hollywood's cartoon) and commercialconsiderations that mandated more infantile approach. COOLWORLD also isn't helped by bad acting - Gabriel Byrne sleepwalksthrough his role, while Kim Basinger unsuccessfully tries to playfemme fatale. Brad Pitt is, on the other hand, interesting in the roleof Cool World's policeman, although his character also suffersfrom screenwriters disregard for logic. In the end, COOL WORLDcould be best described as a film stuck between the worlds andthus unable to function in any of them - children would see it as toodark and incomprehensive, while the adults would have littleunderstanding for its naivety and infantilism. ",Cool World,PG-13,1992,0.5
202,"""The Cooler"" wants to be a lot of things. A character study. A crimedrama. A love story. A portrait of the dirty dealings within a casino.A study on the mysticism of fate and chance. The film features sterlingperformances from William H. Macy (2001's ""Focus""), Maria Bello (2000's""Duets""), and Alec Baldwin (2003's ""The Cat in the Hat""), but notmuch else to grab hold of as the machinations of the many differentplot threads swing out of control in the final act. Directed by WayneKramer with an astute eye for character moments but a nagging implausibilityin its narrative, ""The Cooler"" finally becomes too cute for its owngood, relying so heavily on symbolism to get its points across thatit becomes more ridiculous than lyrical. Bernie Lootz (William H. Macy) is a tired, middle-aged man so unluckyin life that he has been employed for many years by Las Vegas' Shangri-Lacasino as a coolera spreader of bad luck for high stakes rollers.The casino has seen better days, both financially and creatively,something casino director Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin) cannot acceptwhen Bernie's luck takes a complete turnaround after falling in lovewith cocktail waitress Natalie (Maria Bello). As Shelly bullies thenew co uple into giving up their relationship, dire circumstancesinvolving Bernie's estranged son, Mikey (Shawn Hatosy), leave Bernieowing $150,000 to Shellyor else. As a character study of a weary man who has had it with the scuzzylifestyle of living in Vegas and yearns to get out, only for mountingroad blocks to keep getting in his way, ""The Cooler"" is low-key andperceptive. As Bernie, William H. Macy is faultless in the sort ofquietly imploding role one has grown accustomed to him delivering.Maria Bello is truly touching as the down-to-earth Natalie, who issurprised to find herself falling for Bernie, in spite of a naggingsecret she has chosen to keep from him. And Alec Baldwin has never,or rarely, been so consummate and genuinely threatening onscreen.As the savage, heartless Shelly, who is prepared to go to any lengthsnecessary to keep his casino running, Baldwin brilliantly createsa modern-day human villain as scary as any to come along in some time. Unfortunately, the increasingly plot-driven developments start tooutweigh the effectiveness of the human story. If the actors neverfalter, their characters unavoidably become pawns to Frank Hannahand Wayne Kramer's screenplay, rather than natural living beings.Not helping is the smothering symbolism placed throughout the picture.When Bernie gets a coffee at the casino bar and the bartender is outof cream, it means Bernie is out on his luck. When things are goingbetter for him, the bartender has cream. This obvious, amateurishsymbolism is repeated over and over, ad nauseum, and when a particulartwist of good fate occurs at the end when Bernie is at his lowestpoint, it becomes too much to bear. It has long since stopped beingclever, and made a wrong turn toward absurdity. In making ""The Cooler,"" director Wayne Kramer has cooked up threeoriginal, arresting characters, and placed them smack dab in the grittyheart of sin city. That would have been enough for an effectivelyunderstated drama, but it isn't enough for Kramer, who pulls his charactersand the plot in so many different directions that you finally throwyour hands up in frustration and stop caring. ""The Cooler"" is a superbacting showcase simply mired in too many complications for its own good.","Cooler, The",R,2003,3
203,"It has been quite a while since a fun-filled, exciting, old-fashioneddisaster movie has been released, and the wait continues with ""TheCore."" Directed by Jon Amiel (1999's ""Entrapment"") with his tonguehopefully in cheek (but somehow I doubt it), the film has to be physicallyendured to understand just how laughable its every minute is. Whilea suspension of disbelief is certainly essential for most entriesin the ""disaster"" genre, ""The Core"" is so unremittingly over-the-top,goofy, and shallow that there is no connection to the characters,no urgency to their dire circumstances, and no suspense to any ofthe generic action setpieces.  First, the unlikely premise. When the Earth's core suddenly stopsspinning, an electromagnetic field breakdown occurs across the globe.People drop dead without warning, pigeons fly amok, and the RomanColiseum explodes. With the world bound to end in less than a year,a machine is created that will journey to the Earth's core and attemptto jump-start its rotation. Chosen to go on this death-defying missionare physics professor Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart); astronauts RebeccaChilds (Hilary Swank) and Colonel Robert Iverson (Bruce Greenwood);geophysicist Dr. Conrad Simsky (Stanley Tucci); ship creator and tokenblack guy Edward Brazleton (Delroy Lindo); and weapons specialistSergei Laveque (Tcheky Karyo). As threatening lights fill the Earth'ssky and conditions quickly go downhill, the mission runs into oneproblem after the next in its race to save the planet. In a recent interview with ""Entertainment Weekly,"" director Jon Amieldiscussed how he attracted such a fabulous cast filled with actorsusually known for working in character-driven pictures--he assuredthem he was making a movie that focused on  character-dimension overits special effects, rather than the typical vice versa situation.The outcome? He lied through his teeth. ""The Core"" is as rudimentaryand generic as a sci-fi flick of this ilk can get, with its ensemblenothing more than basic, underwritten creations fresh out of Screenwriting101. No room is offered for anyone in the cast, save for one exception,to come off as what seems like a real person. Most don't even getthe time to show emotion. One of the most unfortunate aspects of big-budget, visual effects-drivenmoviemaking is when excellent performers come on board and are sowasted as to almost be a crime. Had I not known that Aaron Eckhartwas utterly captivating in 1997's ""In the Company of Men"" and 1998's""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" and Hilary Swank won an Academy Awardfor her shattering turn in 1999's ""Boys Don't Cry,"" it never wouldhave crossed my mind that they had any semblance of talent or charisma.Swank gets one or two quieter moments near the end that are effective,but otherwise, both actors are stranded in a sea of cliches and blue screens.  The only actor who actually resembles a flesh-and-blood human beingis Stanley Tucci (2002's ""Maid in Manhattan"") as Dr. Conrad Zimsky,a man partially responsible for the disaster who realizes the errorof his ways and is willing to risk his life to make amends. Tucciis more convincing, and there are more details in his role, than inall of the other leads combined. ""The Core"" is filled to the brim with special effects, but every singlemoney shot (and the entirety of some setpieces) have been widely displayedin its trailers and television ads. When these scenes arrive, oneperks up, expecting something at least visually pleasing (since there'scertainly nothing intellectual in sight), only to be disappointedwhen they needlessly add up to very little. Meanwhile, the sheer ludicrousnessof its premise--that a machine, with people inside, will travel thousandsof miles beneath the Earth's surface to fix the core's rotation--earnssome unintentional bad laughs. As does the peculiar-looking D.J. Qualls(2002's ""The New Guy""), eerily playing a young, oddball computer hackerhired by the government to aid in the mission. Qualls throws out oneembarrassing one-liner after the next, and even sheds a tear in onescene to prove his character does have emotion. I didn't buy it for a second. Perhaps the most fatal flaw with ""The Core"" is that there is neveran actual feeling of dread that the Earth is in danger, and the charactersnever react to the news of the end of the world the way real peoplewould. In fact, director Amiel disregards even the most vague hintsof realism within the situation by never showing most of them learningof their possibly grim fate. For the ship's crew, Eckhart, Swank,and company act as if they are headed to the grocery store, ratherthan out to save humanity. ""The Core"" wants to be taken seriously,and it wants to engage viewers in a taut, edge-of-your-seat thrillride. Instead, it is preposterously dumb and often more dull than not.","Core, The",PG-13,2003,2

Playingdumb for all he's worth, Kattan does charm some members of the audience, butthey can have him.

He covers all of the bases, but his rendition is lifeless and flat.The film's talented leads are miscast, and Reynolds's by-the-numbers moviewould be more appropriate as a Hallmark television production than as atheatrical release.  Still, the sets are sumptuous and the scenery -- it wasfilmed completely on location in Ireland and Malta -- is uniformlybreathtaking. As most of us know, the story is a tale of long planned revenge.  EdmundDantes (James Caviezel from FREQUENCY) is falsely imprisoned for treason byVillefort (James Frain), who is working in collusion with Fernand Mondego(Guy Pearce from MEMENTO).  Edmund thinks that Fernand is his best friend,but Fernand is a deceitful guy who has his eyes on Mercedes, Edmund'sfianc_e.  Dagmara Dominczyk phones in her part as Mercedes. The supporting cast is much more effective.  Richard Harris does a nice turnas Faria, Edmund's next-door neighbor in prison.  Edmund and Faria spendmany long years together trying to dig their way to freedom.  The bestperformance is turned in by Luis Guzman, as Jacopo, Edmund's right-hand-manafter Edmund becomes known as the Count of Monte Cristo.   If you haven't seen other cinematic versions of this Dumas story, you'llprobably enjoy this one.  But if you've seen others, this one just feelslike warmed up leftovers that aren't heated enough to be tasty. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO runs too long at 2:10.

206,"Based on the unlikely source material of a Disney theme park attraction,""The Country Bears"" is a sweetheart of a movie. Part road picture,part musical, and part moralistic family drama, the film is a dazzling88-minute entertainment that features a stream of lovable characters(both human and bear, courtesy of Jim Henson's Creature Shop) in anice little story about unconditional love and what being a familyreally means. The original songs, written by John Hiatt, may be thebest use of melodic material written for the screen since Aimee Mann'sincendiary music for 1999's ""Magnolia."" Topping it all off is a G-rated,live-action feature that adults can enjoy just as enormously as theyounger audience members. Following a prologue showing the much-haralded country-rock band,The Country Bears, at the prime of their careers in the early 1990s,the action moves to the present day. Distraught over his older brother,Dex's (Eli Marienthal), taunting about him not being a real familymember because he is a bear rather than a human, 11-year-old BearyBarrington (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) decides to run away fromhis generally happy home to find his birth parents. While on the road,he happens across the Country Bear Concert Hall, which is going tobe demolished by snide banker Reed Thimple (Christopher Walken) unlessthey can come up with $20,000. Soon, Beary has set out with his newfriends to gather up the old Country Bears bandmembers in order tothrow a reunion concert and raise the needed money to save the hall.Meanwhile, Beary's loving and distraught human parents (Stephen Tobolowsky,Meagen Fay) hire two bickering police officers (Diedrich Bader, Daryl""Chill"" Mitchell) to fi! nd Beary, whom they believe has been kidnapped. Aided by a screenplay by Mark Perez, first-time director Peter Hastingshas crafted ""The Country Bears"" into a cheerful family movie withthe right measurements of light-hearted sweetness and rousing song-and-dancenumbers. The path Beary, understatedly voiced by Haley Joel Osment(2001's ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence""), must take in order to findhis rightful place in the world is a universal theme that resonateswithin this fantasy where human beings and talking bears co-exist in peace.  As Beary's unconditionally caring parents, Stephen Tobolowsky (1999's""The Insider"") and Meagen Fay (1999's ""Magnolia"") grasp an idealistictone that appropriately compliments the story, while Eli Marienthal(2001's ""American Pie 2"") is charismatic as brother Dex. As the tokenvillain, Christopher Walken (2001's ""Joe Dirt"") avoids going over-the-top,but it is still awkward seeing someone of his powerful caliber appearing here. An impressive line-up of musicians make cameos, some of which perform.A balladic duet between Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley (playing themselves,as well as the singing voices of two of the bears) called ""Straightto the Heart of Love"" is genuinely beautiful, while other musicalnumbers involving Krystal Harris and Jennifer Paige also delight withvitality and mirth. Credit lyricist and composer John Hiatt for creatinga soundtrack that is a must-buy for anyone into the country-rock and folk-rock genres. Totally absent of bathroom humor, ""The Country Bears"" is a welcomereturn to the more innocent days when the Muppets were the talk ofchildren everywhere. Teaching a valuable lesson about friends andfamily is a tricky topic to pull off without preaching to the olderaudience members, but director Peter Hastings has pulled it off.

207,"      COURAGE UNDER FIRE is the latest film from Director Edward Zwick(GLORY and LEGENDS OF THE FALL).  It is an extremely moving picturethat left me with my heart racing and my arms clutching myself andstaring at the screen.  If you find yourself in tears at points as Iwas, do not be surprised.  This is not a manipulative film, but agenuine one.  It is in a word - devastating.       Denzel Washington plays Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling Inanother brilliant performance by one of the best actors in the worldtoday.  I hope every member of the Academy sees his work in it andremembers it at Oscar time.  He is vulnerable, charming, troubled,honest, confused, strong and scared, and these are only some of theranges of emotions he displays.  His performance alone is worth theseven dollar admission, but the show has much more to offer than justone good piece of acting.  COURAGE UNDER FIRE is filled with marvelousacting, and the acting is not even the best part.       The gripping and intelligent script by Patrick Sheane Duncan basedon his novel, and the directing are the genius of the film.  Thisscript succeeds not on a plethora of clever one liners, but on thefabric it creates.  The show is a tribute to the ambiguity of life andespecially of battle.  It is an intricate puzzle that seems deceptivelysimple but is actually an Escher print of a puzzle.  It uses thecinematic technique of the story told from different viewpoints andwith dramatic editing by Steven Rosenblum.  Rosenblum weaves theserecollections back and forth with the present time as different playersrelate their ever changing visions of reality.       The show starts with a massive tank battle during Desert Storm.Before the battle Colonel Serling calls his troops together for aprayer and then a charge of, ""Let's kill 'em all!""  This mixture of apseudo-football huddle scene with a life and death situation puts theaudience on notice that this picture is not one you will be able totake lightly.  This is high energy entertainment certainly, but onewith some heavy stories to tell.       The tank battle is awesome.  The fiery cinematography by RogerDeakins (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, ROB ROY and MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON)makes it look like a battle between an overgrown set of dinosaurs inHell.  The script is superb in showing the natural confusion of battle.When tanks start firing at each other in the dark, it becomes unclearwho is the enemy and who isn't.  Colonel Serling makes a mistake andorders the destruction of one of his own tanks.  The non-investigationof this along with the Colonel's remorse over it become the subtext ofthe plot.       Most of the show then takes places right after the war.  As anironic conciliation prize, rather than promotion, Colonel Serling andhis superior, General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), are assigned toinvestigate those nominated for battle awards.  The Colonel draws thefirst woman in U. S. history, Captain Karen Walden (Meg Ryan), ever tobe nominated for the Metal of Honor for combat duty.  She was a medicalchopper pilot who was shot down and killed in a courageous battle todefend a downed attack helicopter.       Pentagon PR representative Bruno (Bronson Pinchot) thinks this isfantastic.  He plans to have a tearjerker of a ceremony on the WhiteHouse lawn with all of the networks present.  Pinchot, whom I have haddinner with a couple of times and who can be extremely funny in theright roles, is terribly miscast here.       The show consists of Colonel Serling's interviews with Monfriez(Lou Diamond Phillips), Ilario (Matt Damon), Altameyer (Seth Gilliam),Banacek (Zeljko Ivanek), Boylar (Tim Ransom), and others.  At first, itis an open and shut case - give that woman her metal.  Soon however, afew holes develop or do they?  A reporter, Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn),begins nosing around.  He is interested in finding out the completetruth about the tank battle friendly fire episode and about the CaptainWalden story.       The acting is exceptional although Washington's is head andshoulders above everyone else.  Supporting Academy Award candidates arecertainly possible for Lou Diamond Phillips as the tough poker playingsoldier and Meg Ryan as the is she tough or isn't she Captain.  Thescene where her chopper crashes sent chills all over my body.       This moving film has music by James Horner (LEGENDS OF THE FALL,BRAVEHEART, and APOLLO 13) that is stirring and dramatic - full ofhorns and kettle drums.  An impressive film with an exhilarating scoreto match.       COURAGE UNDER FIRE runs a fast 1:57.  It is rated R for theviolence of war and for some bad language.  There is no sex or nudity.It would be fine for any teenager.  I can not say enough good thingsabout COURAGE UNDER FIRE.  It is movie making at its finest.  I hope tosee Zwick, Washington, Duncan and others getting awards for it.  I giveit my strongest recommendation and award it a full ****. ",Courage Under Fire,R,1996,2.5

Writer and director TimRobbins has hired half of his Hollywood friends to appear in histhree-ring circus of a movie.  Everything is rushed.  Actors run ontothe set, rattle off their lines and run off again.  Robbins then quicklycuts to an entirely different group of actors telling another part ofthe story.  Adding to the unrealistic, circus-like atmosphere of theproduction is a pair of lovers who have a propensity to sneak away,remaining in view of the others and the camera, as they disrobe and haveenthusiastic sex.  Among the many stereotyped characters in the cluttered script are: Agiddy liberal socialite, Countess LaGrange (Vanessa Redgrave), who getsher strike news delivered on a silver platter by her servants.  Ananti-Communist ventriloquist, Tommy Crickshaw (Bill Murray), who isforced by his employer (the federal government in the form of the WPA)to tutor two no-talent, would-be ventriloquists.  An alcoholic director(Welles), who is so hyperactive that his feet rarely touch the ground.And an artist, Diego Rivera (Rub_n Blades), who insists on putting anunauthorized image on Lenin in his large mural inside a skyscraper ownedby Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack).  The rest of the large and talented cast includes Joan Cusack, CaryElwes, Philip Baker Hall, Cherry Jones, Susan Sarandon, Jamey Sheridan,John Turturro, Emily Watson, Paul Giamatti, Barnard Hughes, BarbaraSukowa, John Carpenter and Gretchen Mol.  Almost all of them overact intheir brief time in front of the camera.  None of the characters arecompelling, and, if the movie had aired on television, I'm sure I wouldhave turned it off long before it was over.  Very much in the spirit of ILLUMINATA, which opened this past summer,the fast-paced CRADLE WILL ROCK takes a comedic backstage look at theproduction of a play.  And like ILLUMINATA, although it has its moments,it never comes together in anything approaching a satisfying whole.  Iwould be inclined to suggest that you just wait for the video and usethe fast forward to get to the good parts, but this would require you tofast forward through almost the entire picture, making it not worth thecost.  CRADLE WILL ROCK runs a long 2:15.  It is rated R for language, nudityand sex and would be acceptable for teenagers. ",Cradle Will Rock,R,1999,2

At least this is the impression given by THE CRAFT, 1996 supernatural thriller directed by Andrew Fleming.  The plot begins when Sarah Bailey (played by Robin Tunney), teenage girl deeply traumatised by her mother's death and burdened with suicidal tendencies, arrives from San Francisco to Los Angeles. There she is enrolled into Catholic high school where she finds little in common with most of her peers. Their only friends are three girls who are outcasts, just like her - trailer trash slut Nancy Downs (played by Fairuza Balk), disfigured introvert Bonnie (played by Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True), black girl who suffers from racism. All three of them have found solace in the occult, but when Sarah proves to be natural talent, they form coven of witches and begin using their newly acquired powers to solve problems - becoming pretty, rich or simply getting even with their cruel peers. Along the way Nancy becomes intoxicated with power Sarah doesn't like it and decides to quit. Her friends don't like that which would lead to spectacular conflict.  THE CRAFT has few very talented young actresses showing their skills in superb fashion, especially Fairuza Balk, who turns into one of the most frightening villains in recent memory. Special effects in the film are also good. But those who miss THE CRAFT won't have many reasons to feel particularly bad about it. The plot is full of usual holes, characters are textbook examples of Hollywood cliches, the ending, despite all the special effects and mayhem, is predictable and boring. Even more disappointing is the way screenwriters failed to use potentials of the story about teenage witches in Catholic high school. Only a year later BUFFY would use similar concept to re-write television history and make the impression of THE CRAFT even worse. ","Craft, The",R,1996,1.5
211," Before he came to the United States. Antonio Banderas was astar in Pedro Almodovar's sex comedies in Spain. So it's notsurprising that Banderas's first directorial effort reflectsAmodovar's style of directing, beginning with the opening creditswhich are similar to ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" and""Dark Habits,"" and continuing with an amalgam of wacky whimsy andgenuine emotion throughout the narrative. Written by Mark Childress,the film attempts to interweave two stories, set in 1965. Onechronicles the Civil Rights awakening of a young Southern boy calledPeejoe (Lucas Black), who lives in a funeral home with his morticianuncle, and the second revolves around his zany, flamboyant AuntLucille (Melanie Griffith, Banderas's real-life wife). As the talebegins, Aunt Lucille decapitates her abusive husband, puts his head ina hatbox, and sets off to pursue her dream of a show biz career inHollywood - just as Peejoe sees the sheriff (Meat Loaf Aday) kill ablack boy during a protest at a segregated municipal swimmingpool. Will Peejoe tell the truth to the authorities - or cover up thecrime? That's his moral dilemma. And will Lucille be convicted ofmurder? All the various story elements come together in a bigcourt-room finale, dominated by the gavel of an eccentric judge (RodSteiger). The problem is that the shrill, farcical humor of AuntLucille distracts from the intimate drama of the teenager's coming toterms with bigotry and racial prejudice in his own hometown. And onesimply cannot ignore Melanie Griffith's incongruous jet-black wig andscarlet, collagen-infused lips. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,""Crazy in Alabama"" is a fanciful if uneven 5, offering a few livelymoments of clever insight. ",Crazy in Alabama,PG-13,1999,2

""You said the good times were going to lastforever,"" Bats complains.  ""I thought we'd be dead by now,"" Bobby tells him.Now in their declining years, they have been relegated to working minimumwage jobs to earn enough to the pay the rent.  Apparently, the investmentsof the mob's pension fund must have gone sour.  The hot-tempered Bats worksin the fast food industry as an order taker at Burger King, not exactly ajob well suited for his fiery demeanor.  ""Lady, I know what the commercialsays, but special orders do upset us,"" he angrily tells one customer whodares suggest adjustments in her burger's preparation. A rise in the rents gives them just the opportunity they need to put alittle of the old zest back into their lives.  Figuring that the rents willgo down if someone is murdered in their hotel, they decide to shoot a corpsefrom the morgue, where The Brick works.  Worse than the gang that can'tshoot straight, the Crew can't even bring themselves to plug an already deadman. The man does end up shot, and the Crew gets a drug lord and his gang afterthem in the process.  In addition, Detective Olivia Neal (Carrie-Anne Mossfrom THE MATRIX) starts investigating the murder.  Moss, in an underwrittenrole, turns in one of the film's best performances.  Neal makes mincemeat ofher fellow cop and former lover, Steve Menteer (Jeremy Piven).  Suffice itto say that you don't want to mess with her feet. In low-cut dresses that make her breasts look like huge cantaloupes, Ferris(Jennifer Tilly) is a member of ""the leisure profession.""  Reeking humoroussleaze, Ferris hires the Crew to whack her stepmom, played by Lainie Kazan. This geriatric group and their colorful fellow travelers come up withseveral nice laughs and funny scenes, but too often the jokes themselves arenearly dead.  Writer Barry Fanaro (KINGPIN) just doesn't come up with quiteenough good stuff for me to be able to recommend the picture.  Older audiences, however, will likely be as pleased with it as were myparents.

213,"      When I went into see CRIMSON TIDE, I knew it had a lot going forit.  I had seen the trailers which were charged with excitement.  Iknew it had one of my absolute favorite stars in Denzel Washington andwith another favorite in Gene Hackman.  The story appeared to be a TomClancy style military thriller.  All this notwithstanding, I was notadequately prepared for what was to unfold in front of me.  This showwas phenomenal!       Going into the movie, I was already prejudiced.  I knew it wasabout some Russians threatening to launch nuclear missiles at the US.In the post-Cold War era, I felt it would be hard to worry about thatanymore and so the axiom the movie was built upon would havequestionable credibility.  From the first CNN scenes in CRIMSON TIDE ofRussia fighting a civil war in one of their breakaway republics andthen Russian nationalists taking over part of the military, I realizedhow close this was to the real news reports from over there that we areall naively been ignoring.  The rebel leader looked just like the reallive Russian nationalist and demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovsky who hasindeed threatened the West with nuclear weapons if he ever got intopower.       In CRIMSON TIDE, the Russian rebels have taken over some ofRussia's nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and some of theirsubs.  The US navy dispatches our subs to the Pacific.  This movietakes place almost totally aboard the USS Alabama skipper by seasonedCaptain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman).  Ramsey chooses Lt.  Commander RonHunter (Denzel Washington) as his executive officer since his currentXO has appendicitis.  Ramsey is hell on wheels.  He eats XOs forbreakfast and has been through a half dozen in the past year hisofficers tell Hunter.       Well, as you have seen in the trailers, the rebels get the code tolaunch, some confusion sets in, and the top officers lock horns.  Morethan that I will not tell you.  You will have to endure the suspenseyourself.  If you have a weak heart or suffer from hypertension, youshould be require to get a release from your physician before beingadmitted.       There is so much excellent about this picture it is hard to knowwhere to begin.  The four best parts, and all were equally superb, werethe acting of the two leads, the directing, and the intensecinematography.       Let me deal first with the acting.  I would be happy to see bothstars get Oscar nominations, but Washington was the best.  His piercingstares when angry were almost lethal.  His every scene was compelling.His part was tricky.  It would be easy to overplay it whereasWashington plays it quiet reserved but with absolute authority.  He isopenly vulnerable and yet has tremendous courage and convictions.  Theaudience becomes one with Hunter, and the identification with himbecomes complete.       Hackman has the harder part, and he is match for it.  Ramsey is anextremely demanding skipper who feels that he must push his men to thelimit.  Hackman plays Ramsey in a way that you never hate him even whenhe becomes the bad guy.  Hackman makes you doubt who is right and whois wrong no matter the logic of the script.  Two tour de forceperformances by both.       Although this was really a two person play, it was populated withmany interesting minor characters (Lillo Brancato, Rocky Carroll, MattCraven, James Gandolfini, Jaime Gomez, Michael Milhoan, ViggoMortensen, Rick Schroder).  My favorite was Cob (George Dzundza) whowas shown as Ramsey's right hand man at the start of the movie.Dzundza made a minor part with few lines say a lot.       The directing by Tony Scott was to give us a movie that was at afever pitch from start to finish.  Scott has shown in previous movies(TOP GUN, DAYS OF THUNDER, and BEVERLY HILLS COP II) that he could dothis but only in spurts in a show.  Here this movie is about to explodeit is so hot and this intensity stays from the very start until, butnot including the epilogue.       The most surprising part is the character development by thedirector and somewhat by the screenwriter (Michael Schiffer).  This isnot merely an action thriller a la SPEED or TRUE LIES; this is acharacter study reminiscent of THE CAINE MUTINY.  The life aboard asubmarine was as realistic as DAS BOOT thanks to great set decorationby Michael White, but the lead characters here were much more alive andinteresting.  Actually, the movie that comes to mind immediately is THEHUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, but CRIMSON TIDE is much better.  Scott had megriping the seat most of the film.  Almost like the experience I hadwhen I saw ALIENS for the first time.       The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (who did THE CROW) has to winan Oscar.  Watch the initial scenes in a torrential downpour as Ramseyaddresses his crew football coach style.  The luminescent steel grayrain covering up the sailors so they became almost eerie ghosts was onegood example.  The spray of the sub as it dove was another.  The besthowever was the way the camera created and enhanced tension by extremeclose-ups inside the sub.  Watch the harsh light providing strongcontrast to the shadows aboard ship.  Words can not describe theoverall effect he was able to create.  Finally, the music, especiallythe religious piece song by a chorus at the start and the conclusionwas very moving and effective.       For a show I loved so much, I do have exactly two criticisms.First, the epilogue was unnecessary, and if they felt the need to haveone, this was not the one.  It had the appearance of being added bysomeone in the marketing department who wanted to soften the picture toimprove its box office take.  Make like the epilogue was not there; Idid.  On a more minor note, the screenwriter looses control and givesone character some cliched racist lines to say in one scene that arenot in character and are not of the same intelligent writing quality ofthe rest of the script.       Choose a theater with the biggest screen and the best sound systemin your town, and go early and get a good seat.  Don't wait for video.You want to see this show in all of its glory - upfront and personal.Be sure and go to the restroom in advance.  You do not want to miss aminute of this show.       CRIMSON TIDE runs 1:53, and there is not a wasted minute in it.It is rated R for quite mild violence and a little bad language.  Itwould be fine for anyone able to watch an intense thriller.  I actuallythink kids 10 and over would love it.  This is a **** picture in mybook, and it is my first top ranked film in a half a year since I tryto be very careful with my highest ratings.  See this movie now beforeit migrates to the smaller screens.  Don't miss it! ",Crimson Tide,R,1995,3
214,"    ""Critical Care,"" a spoof of doctors and hospitals moreconcerned with a vital bottom line than in restoring theirpatients' health, is only mildly satiric, but that's OK. A book or movie or theater piece which seeks to ridicule aninstitution of society does not have to hit it over the head witha sledgehammer.  Many mild-manned lampoons are effectiveindeed. You need look only to such masterworks as the musicof Gilbert and Sullivan or the comedies of Oscar Wilde towitness the power of restrained ridicule.  Greedy lawyers, self-seeking doctors, and pseudo-religious hypocrites have beentaunted for a while now.  Didn't Shakespeare's King Henry VIsay ""let's kill all the lawyers,"" Moliere's Tartuffe explain ""To sinin private is not a sin,"" and Paddy Chayefsky's George C.Scott complain ""We cure nothing""?  What we need, then, is anew way of looking at the evils that professionals andinstitutions practice.  Despite Steven Schwartz's clever writingand Sidney Lumet's dutiful direction, ""Critical Care"" is not thatnovelty.     The setting of ""Critical Care,"" which is filmed almostcompletely in a studio, has the airless look of an ultra-modernhospital, one which is surprisingly quiet for an urban medicalcenter, making Dr. Werner Ernst's (James Spader) complaintsabout overwork seem strange.  The story focuses onprofessionals' reactions to two patients near-death; one iscomatose and kept alive only technically, the other quiteconscious but virtually unable to move and eager for death. By the time the film ends, Dr. Ernst has gone through ametamorphosis, changing from a self-serving, skirt chasingphysician eager to make up in money and partying for all thesuffering he endured through ten years of college, to a trueprofessional who feels entitled for the very first time to callhimself a doctor.     The drama takes off when Felicia (Kyra Sedgwick), a bimbomodel whose father is in a persistent vegetative state, asksthat the old man be removed from life support.  The conflictarises when Connie (Margo Martindale), her apparentlydevout, bible-thumping sister, refuses to authorize the pullingof the plug, insisting that dad hears everything she says tohim and communicates by squeezing her hand.  In shortorder the hypocrisy of both women is exposed, but not beforeErnst is seduced by Felicia, leading him into a serious case ofblackmail.     Ernst discusses the case repeatedly with his supervisingphysician, Dr. Butz (Albert Brooks)--who is unrecognizable inthe disguise of an alcoholic geezer with his mind as much onmoney as Ernst's is on models.  Butz comes on as the classiccase of the medical profession's obsession with insurance. Reminding Ernst to treat even hopeless cases if they havecomprehensive, catastrophic coverage and reject those whohave none, Butz is the comic center of the film whose othercharacters seem to speak primarily in the hushed tones of apublic library.  He does convey some words of wisdom worthour consideration: Make sure you do not allot big bucks forcatastrophic health insurance and you'll die with a smile onyour face. Lumet proves his point by displaying some of thesuffering which terminal patients go through while being keptonly technically alive.  ",Critical Care,R,1997,2
215,"Like reheated leftovers, CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES, the third andhopefully last in the series, has little spice left.  There are a few mildlyhumorous moments, but you've seen it all before.  Paul Hogan'sfish-out-of-water story was funny the first time out but already tired byits second outing.  In its defense, this third episode is at least harmlessfamily fare that just barely earns its PG-rating.  You can take your littleones without concern.  ""No worries,"" as Crocodile Dundee would say. Starting and ending in Australia's Walkabout Creek -- population 20 -- themovie lets us observe lots of flora and fauna, especially the colorfulfauna.  But we quickly leave the outback so that our hero, Mick 'Crocodile'Dundee (Hogan), his long-time live-in girlfriend, Sue Charlton (LindaKozlowski), and their son can head off for the wilds of Los Angeles, wheresome really strange creatures live.  The best of these is a guy at a bar(George Hamilton) who recommends a coffee enema as a better regimen for thebody than health foods.  ""It's L.A.,"" the bartender offers in explanation toa dumbstruck Dundee. Hogan is a likable bloke with dark-tanned, crocodile skin.  The intenseAustralian sun has added a lot of wrinkles since we saw him last.  Incontrast, blonde, fair-skinned Kozlowski looks like she stays inside, awayfrom the ultraviolet rays.  Only an extra 30 pounds or so and some naturalaging have changed her.   No Dundee movie would be complete without several knife jokes.  The bestthis time comes when they take the Paramount studio tour.  When their tramis ""attacked"" by a giant anaconda, Dundee sticks his big pocket knife rightthrough the beast's large, mechanical head. The story's minimal plot concerns a money-losing movie studio that keepsmaking lamer and lamer sequels of a film (LETHAL AGENT).

216,"Every year, plenty of bad movies get released theatrically, but onlya precious few are so hideous and disastrously misguided that onewonders how they got made in the first place. If a worse motion picturethan ""The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course""  sees the light of dayin 2002, it will only be by sheer accident. Based on the popular DiscoveryChannel show, in which animal lover Steve Irwin and his wife TerriIrwin risk their lives as they encounter Australian wildlife, ""CollisionCourse"" is a putrid waste of 90 minutes that lacks even a rudimentaryunderstanding of coherent filmmaking. The ridiculous, overly complicated plot concerns a vital satellitebeacon that falls from space and ends up being eaten by a crocodilein the Outback. Government agents, posing as poachers, set off inpursuit of it. Meanwhile, Steve and Terri (shot in a square, televisionaspect ratio) perform their usual shtick, talking directly to thecamera, as they interact with deadly snakes, poisonous spiders, aharmless joey, and the title reptile. As they travel the area, theyinexplicably get involved in the government's search when they unknowinglycome across the crocodile that holds the beacon. In adapting the documentary series into a fictional feature, directorJohn Stainton and screenwriter Holly Goldberg Sloan could not havedevised a more inane and dreadfully boring story if their life dependedon it. Sloppily intercut between the Irwin couple's  animal lessonsare deadeningly dull patches in which the cartoonish government agentsset out over the Australian landscape to track down the beacon. Meanwhile,a third story thread follows a burly redneck woman (Magda Szubanski)whose goals in life are to shoot a crocodile living in a nearby riverand sic her barking canines on anyone who trespasses on her property.  There is not a single engaging character to be found throughout themovie's protracted duration, nor are there even any tolerably cleverlines of dialogue or involving situations. In filming ""The CrocodileHunter: Collision Course,"" director Stainton has gone beyond ""bottom-of-the-barrel""and into the netherworlds of moviemaking hell. Sitting in a theatershowing this picture is, coincidentally, like being trapped in Dante's Inferno. Steve Irwin and Terri Irwin play themselves, which is to say thatthey do not act as much as they mug for the camera, spitting out cornballone-liners at a rate of roughly ten times per minute. While both partiesare surely excited to be making their first feature film, they haveforgotten to introduce anything new to the equation. The governmentagents are excruciatingly banal figures, and the no-name actors' levelof performing would not pass muster in a grade school play. Sitting through ""The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course"" is akin towatching an elongated episode of the cable program (which you canview for free in the privacy of your own home) with a god-awful plotthrown in that makes no sense, and bears no certain purpose. It ispuerile, biodegradable trash that offends by taking up valuable celluloidspace. Steve Irwin might mean well as a person with a soft spot forall animals of the world, but if there is any mercy in the universe,he will never make another movie as long as he lives. We, as the viewer,could only be so lucky.",Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course,PG,2002,0.5
217,"      THE CROSSING GUARD is a movie written, directed, and co-producedby Sean Penn.  Penn has done this all once before in a movie call THEINDIAN RUNNER (1991) which I have never seen.  I hope it is not asflawed as this mess of a movie.       THE CROSSING GUARD starts with a support group for people who havehad relatives killed by drunk drivers.  In the group is Mary Gale(Anjelica Huston) since her then seven year old daughter Emile waskilled five years earlier.  Mary is a real estate agent who now liveswith her two young boys about age seven and her new husband.  Her oldhusband and the father of Emile and the two boys is Freddy Gale (JackNicholson).       Freddy is a New York City jeweler and an alcoholic who spends histime hanging out at cheap strip joints with his male buddies andspending his nights with prostitutes and bottles of Jack Daniel's.Freddy has one raison d'etre, he plans on killing his daughter'skiller, John Booth (David Morse) when he get out from prison.  JohnBooth, name chosen for obvious reasons, is scheduled to get out the daythe movie starts since he has just finished serving his five years formanslaughter for killing Emile with his car while drunk.       What Penn's script attempts to do is to turn the world upsidedown.  The actual killer, Booth, is shown as a shy, tender, andcompassionate man full of great guilt who thinks he may deserve to die.Penn creates him as a totally sympathetic character where as thevictim's father and hence a victim himself as well, is a sleaze bag anda degenerate who has never even visited his own daughter's grave.Hence, the bad guy is the good and vice versa.  In short, it doesn'twork.       The whole movie is about Freddy planning on killing John.  BothFreddy and John and everyone else in the movie are aware of Freddy'splans from almost the beginning.  Whether Freddy does or not kill him,you will find you do not care in the least since none of the charactersare believable.  John was written so sweet he is in danger of having adiabetic attack, and Freddy is so evil you keep wanting a truck to runover him.       Jack Nicholson is a brilliant actor that is wasted in this movie.The scene of him drunk and crying on the phone in the bathroom is thelow point of a dismal movie.  Penn has Nicholson in the whispering modewith many of his lines.  What effect this is supposed to create I couldnever figure out.       The dialog is so bad it almost gets funny.  One of the timesFreddy comes to kill John, John asks, ""Would you mind closing the door.I don't want to wake my parents.""  Later John muses to his girlfriendabout his impending death, ""Freedom is overrated.""  In the worse pieceof script we have John asking his girlfriend, ""What is guilt? Can youdefine it?"" She looks very serious and thinks for what seems foreverand then answers, ""Want to dance?""       The movie is full of strong imagery.  In one of the more striking,we have John Booth with his arms outstretched Christ like chanting""come on, come on"" waiting for Freddy to arrive and do him in.  John'sridiculous image was enhanced by his wearing dark glasses in a darkentrailer.  From there we cut to the scene of Freddy crying in thebathroom.  The show is so full of angst, it is like a class filmproject in Directing 101.       The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond is quite pedantic.  We havesuperfluous slow motion shots to call our attention to obvious points.We have fast pans with hand held cameras to get us dizzy.  Finally wehave lots of night scenes filmed in a medium shade of black.       THE CROSSING GUARD runs on and on at 1:57, and I was foolishenough to have seen every minute of it.  For some reason I was curiousas to the ending.  Don't be; it isn't worth it.  The film is rated Rfor lots of sleazy nudity, alcoholism, some violence, bad language, andsex.  I would just as soon everybody stayed away from it, but it wouldbe acceptable for mature teenagers if they really wanted to see it.  Igive the movie a big thumbs down and award it a single star for atleast trying hard. ","Crossing Guard, The",R,1995,1.5

Can he seduce the newheadmaster's virginal daughter (Reese Witherspoon) who has written anarticle for ""Seventeen"" magazine about how she intends to stay pureuntil marriage? If he wins, Gellar agrees to have sex with him. If heloses, he must give her his vintage 1956 Jaguar convertible.  Howvindictive, perverse and callow can you get? In Christopher Hampton's""Dangerous Liaisons,"" Glenn Close and John Malkovich were, at least,sophisticated adults, even though their behavior was sinister andvicious at a time when a woman's ""reputation"" was crucial to her veryexistence.  In this exploitative film, which is peppered withprofanity, snide, silly, spoiled brats are behaving like...well,snide, silly, spoiled brats, and the parlor game plot unfolds morelike the recent ""She's All That,"" in which a guy bets he can get agirl, gets her, and then realizes he loves her after all. And, as ifthat weren't enough, here there are self-consciously incongruoussubplots involving homosexuality and inter-racial sex.  On the GrangerMovie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Cruel Intentions"" is a ridiculous, fumbling4. It's a lame, trashy teenage soap opera. ",Cruel Intentions,R,1999,2.5
220,"Whenever we had a bull session at the fraternity house backin college days, we'd discuss the young women of the campusand the surrounding area schools.  If any of us found aparticular coed to be grouchy for a period of time, our diagnosiswas consistently, ""She's not getting it.""  Nowadays, such aconclusion would considered politically incorrect, though nodoubt the guys at the fraternity houses still bandy it about, but asI interpret John McKay's concept in his debut feature film""Crush,"" there's at least some truth in it.  Look at McKay'sprincipal character, Kate (Andie MacDowell), for example. Though she's at the top of her career and still in her earlyforties living in a quaint English village in the Cotswolds andheadmistress of a tony school she's moody and distracted anddownright unhappy.  When she gets together for a weeklysession with her two likewise successful buddies, Janine(Imelda Staunton) and Molly (Anna Chancellor), the three ofthem bitch about their unsuccessful attempts to find decentmen.  Molly is a chain-smoking family doctor and Janine is apolice inspector, but the former has been married and divorcedthree times while the latter seems to be ready to give upaltogether.  When Kate does find a man who she thinks is thelove of her life, a handsome 25-year-old  organist and formerpupil named Jed (Kenny Doughty), she enjoys an ecstaticsexual relationship which changes her life and mellows herbuddy-buddy discussions.     Andie MacDowell is made for this kind of role, the sort whichreached near-classic stature with ""Four Weddings and aFuneral.""  In her last picture, ""Harrison's Flowers,"" the forty-fouryear old actress who looks stunning when she lets down herlong frizzy hair is determined to find her photojournalisthusband in Bosnia despite assurances from everyone that he'sdead.  In ""Crush, despite assurances from her two best friendsthat she should consider her much younger friend to be deadbecause the relationship simply would not work out, she persistsjust as strongly.     This absorbing movie, exquisitely photographed by HenryBraham in rich golds and browns among the lovely cottages inthe English countryside giving it a Merchant-Ivory look, gets itsedge from Janine's and Molly's attempts to dissuade Kate fromher new passion, with Molly in particular advising her pal(largely out of envy) that the young stud would wear her out andthen go looking around for someone his own age.  Among thetownsfolks concerned about the affair is Gerald, the reverend atthe school, an older man who bears a crush of his own on thegorgeous Kate but has been too shy to propose marriage.       We get a picture of small-town England as a place that looksswell to the eye, but an area in which we might not want to live. While this is the sort of community in which everyone knowseveryone else and is supportive for the most part, the sameclaustrophobic atmosphere can turn on the resident.  Everyoneknows your business. Everyone has something to advise or, ifnot, is ready to give a dirty look or a titter of two to a ""fallen""woman who passes on the street.       Some might call this a poor-man's ""Four Weddings and aFuneral,"" while at least one other critic has said that the movie is""not one for the men.""  The latter comment is downright sillysince, at the very least, don't all men want to know what womentalk about when they get together and guzzle gin, eat chocolatesand smoke?  Despite the down-and-dirty talk by the threewomen about us scuzzy males, this is not the sort of picture thatwould require you to hide under the chair to avoid your date'swrath.  This is not quite a ""Waiting to Exhale.""  ""Crush"" is, rather,a superbly acted, edgy, fast-paced romp with enough originalityto bypass the usual buddy-movie cliches. ",Crush,R,2002,2
221,"     CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY is set in Natal, South Africa in 1946.  Itis a remake of the 1952 movie of the same name by Zoltan Korda.  Thismovie features James Earl Jones as an Anglican priest by the name ofStephen Kumalo, and it is clearly the best performance of Jones's longcareer of over eighty movies.       CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY starts with sweeping vistas of greatbeauty filmed in luscious color thanks to the cinematography by PaulGilpin.  Although I have never been to South Africa, the terrainreminded me of the Scottish Highlands where I have visited.  The beautyof South Africa resonates perfectly with the richness of Jones's voicein the narration.  The sets (David Barkham) with the contrast of theclaustrophobia of the big city and the poverty of the ghettos areextremely effective.       The movie tells the story of a black priest, Father Kumalo, who isforced to leave his poor country church and travel into the big city ofJohannesburg.  He goes to find his sister Gertrude (Dembisa Kente), hisson Absolom (Eric Miyeni), and his brother John (Charles Dutton), buthe departs with great trepidation.  He tells his wife Katie (LeletiKumalo), ""This is a journey I have always feared.  My people go therenever to return.""  When he gets there he is robbed and the place seemsto be as bad as he feared.  There is a great scene of him lost in thevastness of the big city.       When he finds his brother, he turns out to be a politician withimpressive oratorical skills who is too busy to be bothered with hisrelatives from the country.  Just as there is the clash between blackand white in South Africa, there is also the mutual misunderstandingbetween the people living in the city and those in the country.  Themovie spends more time than most movies dealing with spirituality ingeneral and the true meaning of Christianity in particular.  It isrefreshing to see a movie where people of the cloth are taken seriouslyfor a change.  One priest explains another's actions by saying, ""He hastruth on his side"" to which Father Kumalo answers, ""How can he havetruth without God?""       The city is shown as a place of great sorrow.  In one of the mosthorrific scenes Father Kumalo learns that his son has killed the son ofthe rich white landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris).  The movie isabout the search for Absolom and then his trial.       The marvelous script by Ronald Harwood and direction by DarrellRoodt weave a tale of great power and sadness but do it in anunderstated fashion that never manipulates the audience's emotions.Nevertheless, there was many a tear shed in the theater I was at, and Icould hear frequent sobbing.  Moreover, every single person stayeduntil all of the credits finished and the house lights went up becausethey were so mesmerized by the show.  The ending is perfect, and Ithink hopeful.       Ah, the acting.  Everyone in the movie was quite good, but Joneswas head and shoulders above everyone else.  He cried in the show, hewas scared in the show, and yet he was brave.  A more moving andpowerful performance I have not seen in a long time.  If he does notget an Academy Award nomination for it, they ought to disband theAcademy as hopeless lost.       The music by John Barry is extremely moving without ever beingoverpowering.  I love the costumes (Rui Filipe) especially the largebrimmed hats that the priests wear.       CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY runs a fast 1:49 thanks to crisp editing(David Heitner).  The movie is rated PG-13 for a little violence, butthere is no sex, nudity or bad language.  I would have no troubletaking kids 10 and over.  This is a subtle but wonderful film that Irecommend to you strongly, and I give it *** 1/2. ",Cry the Beloved Country,PG-13,1995,3.5
222,"      From the director of THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE, RennyHarlin, we have CUTTHROAT ISLAND.  It was one of last year's big budgetfilms costing almost $100 million dollars to make.  Unless it becomes abig hit in the video stores, it is destined to be a megaflop.  You canpay three bucks now and see it on pay-per-view.       Unlike other expensive films where most of the money goes to thesuperstars, here the money appears to be spent on the production.Renny Harlin comes from the Cecil B. DeMille school of movie making.The only difference is he does not have DeMille's talent.  What Rennydoes know how to do is create explosion after explosion.  His motto is:when the pace is in danger of slowing a bit, blow up something.  Thistechnique can work in a movie with more of a plot, as this year'sEXECUTIVE DECISION, but here it only serves to let people test outtheir new subwoofers.  To Renny's credit, he probably made asignificant dent in the unemployment rate since there are thousandsupon thousands of extras.       The plot is that in the 1600s ""notorious lady pirate"" MorganAdams's (Gina Davis) father dies.  She gets the crew of his ship toelect her captain over her rival.  The election is ultimately decidedby a single person, but it does provide an early example of democracyin action.       She tells the crew that she has a map to buried treasure, butthere are two problems.  First she has only a third of the map.  To getone of the other parts they will have to fight the evil Dawg (FrankLangella) and his ship of rival pirates.  The other problem is the mapis in Latin, which none of them can read.  They solve this problem bybuying a doctor, William Shaw (Matthew Modine), who has been put inprison for stealing and turned into a slave.       The show pays only lip service to the idea of a plot.  This is apure swashbuckling action picture.  Here Davis attempts to be a femaleDouglas Fairbanks.  She kills people left and right, and she gets innumerous knockdown fistfights where she always wins.  Davis hastremendous fun playing a pirate - wouldn't we all?  Too bad thedirector did not worry more about whether the audience was having fun.About 10 minutes of this is somewhat interesting, but then it is purerepetition.       The script by Michael Frost Beckner, Bruce Evans, and RaynoldGideon has nothing of value to say.  It wastes little time withcharacter development or plot, best to get the actors to the next fightas quickly as possible.  A typical line is Shaw's, ""CongratulationsMadam.  Another town you've destroyed.""       The cinematography (Peter Levy) is full of bright lights andstrong colors.  The music (John Debney) is alive and pulsates with aheavy beat right along with the sounds of the cannons and the guns.The sets (Norman Garwood) are enormous, and the costumes (EnricoSabbatini) elaborate.  No expense is spared.  I have a friend who looksfor plotless action films for watching while working out on hisNorticTrac, this is perfect for that.  If your TV has a knob that turnsoff the dialog, feel free to do so without worrying about losing out onany content.       Finally, in Renny Harlin's defense, he has made a single goodfilm.  His DIE HARD 2 is spectacular, and it has a strong narrativedrive.  I guess once you come up with one winner, the studios opentheir bank accounts to you forever.       CUTTHROAT ISLAND runs an unnecessarily long 2:03.  It is ratedPG-13 which is probably right given the violence level.  There is a lotof violence, but it is pretty cartoonish.  CUTTHROAT ISLAND would befine for kids say 8 or 9 and up.  I was bored silly by it, but it doespossess an impressive sound and look.  I would advise catching one ofthose short cable films that talks about the making of the movieinstead and skip the show itself.  The excerpts suffice.  I give thepicture a thumbs down and rate it * 1/2. ",Cutthroat Island,PG-13,1995,1.5
223,"After the embarrassing one-two-three punch of 2002's ""Showtime,"" ""ISpy,"" and ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" (along with ""BattlefieldEarth,"" a runner-up for the worst film of the 21st century), the onlyway for Eddie Murphy to go was up. By the very nature that it is moreappealing than a lobotomy, ""Daddy Day Care"" is a superior Murphy venture.For those keeping track of his career trajectory for the last tenyears, you will already know that this does not mean the movie isparticularly good or worthwhile, but that it is at least of tolerable mediocrity.  Charlie Hinton (Eddie Murphy) is a marketing executive who, afterfailing to raise interest from children on their new cereal product,the unlikely-named ""Veggie-O's,"" is fired. With his supportive lawyerwife, Kim (Regina King), at work all day, half of their income suddenlycut off, and preschool-aged son, Ben (Khamani Griffin), needing someoneto watch him, Charlie enlists fellow fired coworkers Phil (Jeff Garlin)and Marvin (Steve Zahn) to help him open up their own day care center.Without any experience in caring for more than one child at a time,they at first believe they have gotten in way over their heads, andthen start to enjoy themselves and get the hang of it. Such a hit are Charlie, Phil, and Marvin with the neighborhood parentsthat competing day care institution Chapman Academy, headed by thestrict and witchy Miss Harridan (Anjelica Huston), finds its enrollmentquickly shrink. Along with her reluctant assistant, Jenny (Lacey Chabert),Miss Harridan will stop at nothing to sabotage Charlie's new business.All the while, Charlie has an epiphany about what it truly means tobe a good father as he closely bonds with Ben. Directed by Steve Carr (2001's ""Dr. Dolittle 2""), ""Daddy Day Care""has so much potty humor in the first half and so much syrupy, feel-goodemotion in the second that the proceedings threaten to drown all theparticipants. For children between the ages of 5 and 10, this lazy""Kindergarten Cop""-wannabe will utterly delight. With not a singlerisque moment of adult humor or realistic child behavior outside offarting jokes, however, the film constantly plays things so safe itmay not do a thing for the older audience members. In fact, the moviemay hold the record for number of times a person trips or falls forcomedic purposes. Either way, it's not funny. Not counting 2001's incendiary CG-animated ""Shrek,"" one wonders ifEddie Murphy realizes he hasn't made a respectable motion picturesince 1999's ""Bowfinger"" (and even then, it was a supporting role).After last year, when he couldn't have been involved in more ill-fatedprojects if he tried, every thinking person is likely left with thesame obvious question: does he read the actual screenplays beforesigning on to projects? No, make that two questions: Why hasn't hefired his manager by now? ""Daddy Day Care"" is one of his more respectablepictures of the last few years, but it is strictly of the cookie-cuttervariety--unintelligent, inoffensive, and completely wasteful of Murphy'slong-unchartered comic talents. As the villainous Miss Harridan who, in all fairness, seems to runa fairly educational program for youngsters, Anjelica Huston (2002's""Blood Work"") injects many of her scenes with an over-the-top deviance,but is much too fine an actress for this one-note role. Her finalscenes, meant to elicit rollicking laughter as we witness her comeuppance,is just plain mean-spirited and bewilderingly unfunny. As her assistant-with-a-conscience,Jenny, gifted young performer Lacey Chabert (TV's ""Party of Five""and 2001's ""Not Another Teen Movie"") also deserves better. ReginaKing (1998's ""Enemy of the State"") is given the thankless part ofCharlie's wife, who disappears at her job for nearly the whole last hour. The few fleeting moments of real successful humor are not courtesyof slumming screenwriter Geoff Rodkey, but due to the offbeat, alwayswelcome appearance of Steve Zahn (2001's ""Joy Ride""). Zahn is occasionallyhilarious as superhero-loving child-at-heart Martin--""occasional""because he has far less screen time than dull daddy co-stars Murphyand Jeff Garlin (2002's ""Full Frontal""). Some of the song choices,including the Jackson 5's ""ABC,"" The Ramones' ""I Wanna Be Sedated,""and Bachman-Turner Overdrive's ""Takin' Care of Business,"" also keepthe pace from ever lagging.  In the end, ""Daddy Day Care"" does not quite wear out the viewer'spatience, and for this small but admirable feat, it manages a barelypassing grade. The problem is, there is no genuine heart or soul tothis movie beyond the artificial, pre-packaged fluff during the climax,meant to tug at your heartstrings but only succeeding at tugging onyour bullshit radar. Director Steve Care mistakenly believes he hasdone his job by merely carrying out the key plot concept, but thereis nothing substantial surrounding it to warrant 93 minutes. Evenif their characters are as plastic as everything else in ""Daddy DayCare,"" at least the kids are cute.",Daddy Day Care,PG,2003,2
224,"In 1980s I used to spend a lot of free time playing variousgames on my ZX Spectrum home computer. Among them was THEDAM BUSTERS, one of the rare computer simulations based onthe real historical event. The event in question was perhapsnot the important military operation of World War Two, butit was definitely one of the more spectacular. Its dramaticpotential was, of course, recognised by the filmmakers andsome three decades before being turned into computer game,and twelve years after the event itself, THE DAM BUSTERSbecame feature film, directed by Michael Anderson.  The plot begins in spring of 1942. Hitler's war machine iswrestling with Red Army deep in the Russian heartland, whilethe rest of Europe is firmly under Axis control and it wouldremain so for the time being, since Allied ground forces inBritain are still unprepared to mount invasion. The bestAllies can do is to send hundreds of bombers over Germanyand other occupied countries in order to attack industrialfacilities, communications and infrastructure and thusweaken Hitler's war potential. British scientist BarnesWallis (played by Michael Redgrave) is convinced that thestrategy isn't working and that many raids on individualfactories won't significantly shorten the war. Instead hedreams of a single strike that would knock out entire Ruhr,industrial heart of Germany. Ruhr is dependant on watersupplies stored by three huge dams - Oeden, Moene and Sorpe- and if they are destroyed, the factories shouldpermanently stop working. Destruction of these dams requireshuge quantity of explosives, completely new bomb design andquite new method of delivery. Wallis has solved thoseproblems in theory, but he would have to wait almost a yearbefore he receives necessary funds, resources and personnelfrom military and civilian bureaucrats. While the projectenters in the final stages of R&D, RAF has picked up aselect group of best pilots and formed Squadron 617, led byWing Commander Guy Gibson (played by Richard Todd). Beforethey carry out the attack, they must spend months inrigorous training, because the operation requires low-levelnight flying, extremely precise speed and altitude. Finally,on May 16th 1943, Gibson and his men begin the mission,called Operation Chastise, that would be remembered as oneof the most spectacular and daring air raids of World WarTwo.  When R.C. Sheriff began writing the script for this film, heprobably thought that the event itself was interestingenough, and that the film didn't require melodramaticsubplots or character development. It was very fortunate,because many similar films based on true stories sometimessuffer because of the scriptwriters' need to make themdramatically appealing. The ascetic plot of THE DAM BUSTERS,however, has some interesting elements - Wallis' strugglewith technical problems and red tape in the first part ofthe film is nicely contrasted with Gibson's training and theraid itself. Those two characters also have a goodinteraction - veteran British actor Michael Redgrave playsBarnes Wallis as very emotional man, extremely dedicated tohis job to the point of near madness; Richard Todd, on theother hand, plays Gibson as the embodiment of British""stiff-upper-lip"" ideals and pragmatism. Gibson and Wallis,however, have more in common that they are ready to admit;Gibson's inner feelings and dilemmas are only hinted, butthat doesn't make those scenes less powerful.  The thing that put THE DAM BUSTERS in the annals of theseventh art is the raid scene that would decades laterinspire George Lucas for the final battle in STARS WARS: ANEW HOPE. The inevitable comparisons between those twoscenes are rather bad for Anderson's film; special effectsare unimpressive, even for 1950s standards, and the darknessand black-and- white photography make it even lessappealing. The impression is somewhat improved with scenesthat feature some nice aerial photography and authenticLancaster bombers. The latter were provided by RAF, which,in the end, received hagiographic treatment by Anderson andother filmmakers. THE DAM BUSTERS ends with raid, beingportrayed as successful; controversies of its overallsuccess and true effectiveness of the Operation Chastise, aswell as the effectiveness of the entire strategic bombingcampaign, were left to future historians.  Another controversy surrounding this film came out offilmmakers' need to make this film as historically accurateas possible. Gibson had a black dog named ""Nigger"", and thedog is not just featured and often being referenced in thefilm, but its name was used as code word during the raiditself. US version later had the objectionable word dubbedwith the word ""Trigger"", and some scene featuring it wereedited out, making some of the scenes incomprehensible.Whether Gibson was genuine racist or not, we would neverknow, since he got killed later in war. This little detailcould remind the 1990s audience about the fact that thenotions of political correctness we take for granted todayweren't there only few decades ago. And we could also bereminded that even the people we consider to be the heroesaren't always perfect. ",Dam Busters,NR,1954,3
225,"It's curious that the dethroned 1984  Miss America, Vanessa L. Williams,has probably made a more memorable career for herself than the majorityof bland, pretty faces who have worn the Atlantic City crown. (She losther title after nude photos were published in ""Penthouse"" magazine.)  In her new movie, ""Dance With Me,"" she does the older woman/youngerman samba with Puerto Rican pop singing sensation Chayanne. She playsa sulky single mom who, having been dumped by her abusive professionaldancing partner (Rick Valenzuela), teaches two-step classes to Texansat a Houston studio owned by Kris Kristofferson. Along comes sensuousChayanne, as an ambitious Cuban immigrant (think young Desi Arnaz),and Vanessa's inner rhythms start beating Babaloo! Little does sheknow that this sizzling handyman from Havana is really Kristofferson'sson - of course, no one else knows it either. The muddled,cliche-ridden soap opera story, written by choreographer DarylMatthews and directed by Randa Haines (""Children of a Lesser God""),revolves around losers becoming winners as the competitive beat goeson, culminating in the predictable, show-stopping dance-contestfinale. And there's a brief homage to the late, great Gene Kelly asChayanne dances through lawn sprinklers a la ""Singing in the Rain.""But, if you want to see this kind of film even better made, Irecommend ""Strictly Ballroom"" (1992), a witty, spirited, Australianmusical, directed by Baz Luhrmann (""Romeo and Juliet""). On the GrangerMovie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Dance With Me"" is a spicy, schmaltzy 6 with atangy salsa beat. ",Dance With Me,PG,1998,2
226,"Foreign terrorist groups, like local gangs within the U.S., appearto compete over how much mayhem they can cause.  A recentreport in the NY Times suggests that the Tamil Tigers, fighting foran independent state within Sri Lanka, have been the most brutal. By contrast, the Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path faction in Peru, has causedproblems for years but when compared to gangs like Hamas, Al Queda and Hezbollahare small potatoes (or little lima beans, if you will).  ""The Dancer Upstairs""is based on an actual case of the search for a notorious South American Senderoleader with the romantic angle presumably the most fictionalized aspect and isof significance both as John Malkovich's directorial debut and because unlike007 its hero comes across as a real person whose life is defined by hiscommitment to his daughter and to genuine ideals.     Malkovich, who joins Nicolas Cage and George Clooney as major performers whohave recently tried their hand at the helm, has given his audience a humdingerof Nicholas Shakespeare's spy story which, despite its character-driven approachbuilds up enough tension to get the heart racing.  While in one sense the storyrecalls the capture and life term given in Peru to American Laurie Berenson,""The Dancer Upstairs"" works on several levels: We get a clear picture of a36-year-old man who despite high ideals loses some of his focus in hisfascination with his young daughter's ballet teacher and who does his jobtracking down a terrorist because of a sense of duty rather than an obsessionthat embraces all of his waking life.  As such we see the highly educatedpoliceman Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) reject a career as a lawyer, a risingstar in line for a judgeship in his unnamed South American country, chuck hisvocation because of its perceived dishonesty, and try to serve the law in a morehonest albeit far less remunerative job as a cop.  Amen.     Promoted and given the job of tracking down a terrorist who calls himselfEzequial (unnamed in this review in the interest of preserving the suspense), heis confronted by a man who calls himself the Fourth Wall of Marxism and whoannounces his presence not only by a series of explosions and politicalassassinations but by hanging dogs on lampposts bearing signs ""Long LivePresident Ezequial.""  Faced with a deadline of two weeks after which the corruptgovernment will declare martial law and a suspension of liberties, Rejas,together with his colleague Sucre (Juan Diego Botto), utilizes techniquesranging from a tape of Costa-Gavras' ""State of Siege"" to an examination of thegarbage tossed out on a street believed to house the criminal.       Given the nature of his bimbo wife Llosa (Elivira Minguez), we do not wonderthat Rejas would pursue the passionate and mysterious ballet teacher, Yolanda(Laura Morante), a distraction that could prove deadly to his mission.     If the tense but always humanistic ""The Dancer Upstairs"" is a sign of whatMalkovich can do behind the director's seat, we can only hope that the man willcontinue with his blazing career on the stage and in front of the camera whileat the same time looking into directorial projects as challenging andbreathtaking as this gem.  The credit is shared by a stellar cast headed byJavier Bardem, who bears a resemblance to George Clooney (but who can act) andwho made a name with the arthouse crowd with Julian Schnabel's ""Before NightFalls"" - a compelling look at the life of Cuban  Reinaldo Arenas who discovershis homosexuality and is persecuted as a writer.     What makes this picture particularly unusual is its pot pourri of performersincluding an Italian (Laura Morante), a Spaniard whose English bears a heavyaccent (Barden), and others whose first languages are other than English makinga valiant effort to speak Milton's tongue with as light an accent as possible. ""Dancer"" is filmed impressively by Jose Luis Alcaine in Ecuador, Portugal andMadrid, perhaps because Peru would not be eager to show its government past orpresent as corrupt.  One wonders, though, why a single country, say beautifulEcuador, would not have sufficed for the entire production.   ","Dancer Upstairs, The",R,2003,2.5
227,"It's amateur night at the movies in DANCER IN THE DARK, the musical writtenand directed by Lars von Trier (BREAKING THE WAVES).  From factory floorproduction numbers to death row dances, the movie doesn't shy away fromunusual locales for singing and dancing.  But with musical numbers that areso awful that they are only one notch away from the musical spoof in THEPRODUCERS, DANCER IN THE DARK isn't likely to have you running out topurchase its soundtrack.  If this movie were ever to open on Broadway, theycould hold the opening and closing night parties simultaneously. There may be those that will argue that Trier, famous for the stern DOGMA 95manifesto -- under whose rules this picture wasn't made, although it wasshot on digital video -- wants DANCER IN THE DARK to be viewed as a tragedy.If that is how we are to evaluate it, then there is even less to recommendit. European singer Bj_rk stars as Selma, the story's dirt-poor heroine, who israpidly going blind.  Not a professional actress, Bj_rk, with her awkwardand unreal performance, is unlikely to ever be mistaken for an actress.(For the record, she does at least have a lovely smile.)  As a drama, thestory requires one suspension of disbelief after another.   Selma has a congenital disorder that will cause her to go blind within ayear.  She has been saving up for an operation for her son so that he willnot suffer the same fate.  Working two shifts at a factory that requires herto operate heavy machinery and rehearsing for an amateur production of ""TheSound Of Music,"" she must have little time for the preteen son that she istrying to save. Selma's passion is the movie musical.  She loves watching musicals andmaking up her own routines to which she sings and dances, along with othermembers of the cast.  An essential ingredient of musicals is music that isworth hearing.  In DANCER IN THE DARK, the songs are more spoken than sung,and they are excruciatingly bland.  You know the songs are coming becausethe movie's drab color palette, which approximates a faded home movie, ischanged to oversaturated colors reminiscent of old Technicolor musicals. Speaking of filming, you'd better take along your motion sickness medicineto DANCER IN THE DARK, which frequently looks like it was filmed during aseries of earthquakes.  If your son panned and zoomed this much with yourfamily's camcorder, you'd lecture him and then erase the tape. The body of the morose movie concerns a murder and Selma's imprisonment.  Italso includes two quite horrific scenes.  This movie, which has producedwidely different opinions from praise to derision, is an uneasy one to viewbecause some of the scenes, especially toward the end, are so manipulativeand ridiculous that they are laughably bad.

228,"Africa has plenty of exotic locations, but American filmmakers have ignored it, especially in last few decades. It is hardly surprising that one of rare films that features American actors on African locations is actually Canadian. This is DANGER ZONE, 1996 action adventure directed by Allan Eastman.  Protagonist of the film is Rick Morgan (played by Billy Zane), American engineer who runs mining facility in East Zambezi, small African country ravaged by civil war. There he is visited by his old friend Jim (played by Robert Downey Jr.), shady mercenary type who just happens to have some toxic waste in his possession. Soon the facility is attacked by even shadier mercenary types led by Chang (played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and the toxic waste is spilled, resulting in ecological disaster. The blame is put on Rick who gets deported from the country. Later he is approached by Dupont (played by Ron Silver) and asked to return and track down part of toxic waste which is unaccounted for. Rick agrees and is joined by Kim (played by Lisa Collins), UN nuclear waste expert. Rick soon finds that the waste contains something which is quite precious to some powerful individuals and organisations.  DANGER ZONE stands out among low budget action movies because the screenplay by Jeff Albert and Danny Lerner finds time for some critical observations about present-day Africa and the role of corporate West in fueling civil wars, famine and other tragedies associated with Dark Continent. But this criticism is only superficial and actually hardly noticeable because of the plot filled with usual action movie cliches. Billy Zane, who co-produced the film, is quite relaxed in his role while director Allan Eastman tries to pay homage to INDIANA JONES movies. In the end, however, pyrotechnics takes over and the film is drowned by predictable conclusion. DANGER ZONE is at times good to watch, especially because of the exotic locations of post-apartheid South Africa, but the viewers are nevertheless left with the impression that the movie could have been much better. ",Danger Zone,R,1996,1.5
229,"      As the wealthy, but illiterate, assembled wives stare indisbelief, Veronica Franco, the highly educated courtesan, uses Latinto discuss the common fruit she holds in her hand and then performs anerotic act with it that challenges the laws of physics.  The stunninglybeautiful Catherine McCormack, the female lead in BRAVEHEART, plays thepoetry-spewing prostitute.       Welcome to the city-state of Venice in the late 1500s.  Theopening credits of DANGEROUS BEAUTY, thankfully, say the story is true-- it's based on Margaret Rosenthal's biography ""The Honest Courtesan.""Were it not true, as it claims to be so, the frequently ridiculous,silly plot would have had the audiences laughing at all the wrongplaces.       We learn, for example, that most women of that era, with theexception of courtesans, were not able to read.  It seems thecourtesans were the only females permitted in the libraries becausethey needed the knowledge to advise their clients in more matters thanjust sex.  For those of you who have trouble suspending disbelief inmovies, this film may short-circuit your brain.       Jeannine Dominy's screenplay adaptation takes a modern languageapproach, laced with poetry, that might be termed Shakespeare-lite, sothere are ample opportunities to ridicule the picture if you are soinclined.       But don't get me wrong, as filmed in a romantic haze by BojanBazelli and as sumptuously decorated by Norman Garwood, the productiondazzles the eyes at every turn.  When the boy king of France comes tovisit, the royal barge is gorgeous coming down the canal.  Even moredazzling and bizarre is the film's opening.  Gondolas take everycourtesan in the city through the waterways as the city's adoring malesburst out in hoots, calls and poetry.  The women, lapping it up,respond by flashing bare breasts back at them.  (This much nudity soearly in a picture is not a good sign.)       Jacqueline Bisset, cast against type, plays Veronica's mother,Paola.  The script likes to include advice, witty and bawdy.  WhenVeronica asks her mother about marriage, her mother chides her that,""Marriage is a contract, Veronica, not a constant tryst.""  (Thecourtesan's life is just the opposite, as Veronica will soon find out.)       Veronica's old friend Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) returns after along absence to find that she has developed into a great beauty.  Heuses come-on lines that include, ""God made sin that we might know hismercy.""  They love each other, but his father, played in a tiny part byJeroen Krabbe, lectures Marco that he cannot marry beneath hisposition.       Veronica's resourceful mother has just the right solution, sheshould take up a trade.  Since she can't marry her beloved, she canbecome a courtesan and bed him anyway.  In shock, Veronica learns thather mother had been a courtesan herself.  Some of the show's betterscenes have Jacqueline Bisset instructing her daughter in the ways ofthe flesh using vegetables and a nude male model who looks like he isposing for a great artist.  The movie has the potential to become acamp classic.       Although the costumes look authentic, especially the ridiculouseight-inch platform shoes that the courtesans wear, the simple make-uplooks exactly like what you see on the street today.       Veronica not only becomes a courtesan, she is an instant hit.  Herdance card, as it were, becomes fully booked overnight.  Poor Marcofinds even he can't get a reservation.  Veronica quickly turns into aliterary success as well.  She has a book published of her poetry andengages the men in duels of poetry, sometimes lewd but more often not.In a big showdown with her old friend Maffio, played with style byOliver Platt, they battle with words and swords.       As absurd as it is at times, the movie, directed by MarshallHerskovitz from the TV series ""My So-Called Life,"" can be quite cute.And with its full plate of romance, jealousy, humor, titillation andeven a bit of pathos, it tries to please everyone.  The light-heartedshow quickly turns dark at the last with the arrival of the HolyInquisition.  But the ending scene, which you've seen a hundred timesbefore, neatly wraps it all up.       Although parts of the picture are enjoyable, the characters neverrise above playacting.  Like some ribald tale from the Playboy Channelbut with most of the sex scenes edited out, the movie is never surewhat it wants to be.  It's certainly not soft porn, but neither is itis very substantial.       DANGEROUS BEAUTY runs 1:41.  It is rated R for nudity, sex andprofanity and would be acceptable for teenagers if they are both olderand mature. ",Dangerous Beauty,R,1998,2
230,"First, let me assure you that this imaginative adaptation of the lateChris Fuhrman's novel has nothing to do with the Catholic Church's currentchild-abuse scandals. Instead, it's a coming-of-age drama for adults who are hipenough to recall their comic-book-influenced adolescence. The '70s storyrevolves around two parochial school pals - Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch) and TomSullivan (Kieran Culkin) - who chafe under the strict, oppressive regime imposedby zealous, peg-legged Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster). Their families may bedysfunctional but their imaginations know no bounds as Francis channels hisrepressed rage into sketching a comic book with three superheroes, ""The AtomicTrinity,"" who battle the big, bad, motorcycle-riding Nunzilla in the kingdom ofSorcerella. Francis also falls for troubled classmate Maggie Flynn (JenaMalone), who's hiding a shameful secret. But it's mischievous Tim who believes""Risk leads to greatness"" and devises devilish pranks - like dumping Valiums inthe communion wine, swiping the school's prized statue of St. Agatha, andconcocting an ill-fated plot to capture a cougar from the Animal Forest toterrify Sister Assumpta. And there's a chain-smoking priest (Vincent D'Onofrio)who speaks in platitudes when he isn't swearing, ""Jesus H. Christ!"" (""What doesthe H. stand for?"" the boys ask.) Director Peter Care and writers Jeff Stockwell& Michael Petroni adroitly mix realistic segments with ""Spawn"" creator ToddMcFarlane's vivid, fantasy ""alter-ego"" animation. On the Granger Movie Gauge of1 to 10, ""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" is a innovative, irreverent 8,cleverly capturing the challenging, chaotic confusion of youth, reminiscent ofFrancois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" (1959). It's splendidly stylish, scary,savvy story-telling. ","Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, The",R,2002,3
231,"Apart from its main goal - forcing world masses to part with theirmoney in order to watch garbage on the big screen - Hollywoodpropaganda can have strange, bizarre and sometimes evenfrightening effects on people. One of those effects was noticed bythe author of this review when he was in cinema theatre, watchingDANGEROUS MINDS, 1995 drama directed by John N. Smith.Some time in the middle of the film, the audience for the first timehad opportunity to hear Coolio's ""Gangsta's Paradise"" - song thathad flooded the world's airwaves for the sake of movie'spromotion. Upon hearing familiar words and music, almost everyyoung girl in the theatre started to sing that tune with the fervourand passion you could expect only from the fanatical followers ofan obscure religious cult.  This event describes both strength and the weakness ofDANGEROUS MINDS. Although based on the true story, describedby former Marine lieutenant Louanne Johnson (played by MichellePfeiffer in the film) in her book MY POSSEE DON'T DOHOMEWORK, the plot is nothing new. Our heroine takes the job ofan English teacher in East Palo Alto high school, place where themajority of students are Latinos and blacks from troubled inner-city neighbourhoods. Her class is worst of them all, made out ofhopeless students. Louanne, however, notices hidden potentialamong them and devises successful strategy to win their heartand minds and thus incite them towards learning and gettingdiplomas. Unfortunately, conservative school establishment showslittle understanding towards her unorthodox methods, while one ofthe students, Emilio Ramirez (played by Wade Dominguez) getsinvolved in a conflict that could get tragic consequences.  DANGEROUS MINDS is just another standard (and cliched) storyabout noble teacher who rescues unprivileged children by showingthem the world that exists beyond their ghetto walls. As such, itwas more suitable for television, yet the well-oiled hype machine oflegendary producers Jerry Bruckheimmer and Don Simpson, notdiscouraged by the lack of chases, explosions and ""cool"" CGIeffects turned it into full-blown summer blockbuster. This triumphof hype is, of course, unmatched by the achievements offilmmakers. Ronald Bass' script is formulaic, with clichecharacters and predictable situations and plot points. The film isrescued solely by the good acting. Michelle Pfeiffer is trulyimpressive in one of her ""meatier"" roles, and her efforts are aidedby good work of George Dzundza who plays her friend, colleagueand mentor. John Neville (best known as Well-Manicured Man in X-FILES) also makes a memorable cameo as waiter. In the end,viewers would have little reason to be disappointed, but the authorof this review still believes that DANGEROUS MINDS didn't belongto the big screen. ",Dangerous Minds,R,1995,2.5
232," [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written yearsago when I was just getting started and never posted.I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many detailsare missing that I would normally include today.]       Last night I saw A DANGEROUS WOMAN starring Barbara Hershey,Gabriel Byrne, and most of all Debra Winger.  I gave the movie 2 stars.I liked it but could not recommend it.       A DANGEROUS WOMAN had very poor directing by Stephen Gyllenhaal.Overall the show was a mess.  You could fall asleep in parts it went soslow.  You may remember Gyllenhaal from all of the TV movies he hasdirected.  Perhaps you saw his awful PARIS TROUT on TV.       What was good about A DANGEROUS WOMAN was Debra Winger's part.She played someone who the doctors could find nothing wrong with butwho suffered from an extremely low IQ.       The movie centered around Winger's sexuality.  She gave anabsolutely wonderful performance.  Very realistic.  I wish she had abetter director.  The other people in the movie were acceptable butnothing special.       There is one scene in the movie that was more chilling than anyhorror show.

233," While I was watching it, I loved Dante's Peak. It was a greataction/disaster movie with lots of interesting sequences, rivetingspecial effects, and likeable characters. Afterwards, the movie left mymind completely. It didn't resonate with any interesting themes orideas; it was just a story, and it was done. But really, what else couldanyone ask from an action movie?  The effects-laden previews made thismovie look like Twister, which I did not like. Many critics have calledthe two movies similar. Roger Ebert even outlines the ""rules"" for suchdisaster movies in his review. But I disagree that adherence to thegenre necessarily makes a sub-par movie. Some formula movies work andothers don't. Dante's Peak works.  Pierce Brosnan plays Harry Dalton, a volcanologist from the U.S.Geological Survey, who is sent to the perky little town of Dante's Peak.Strange things are happening in Dante's Peak; or maybe they aren't.That's what Harry has to find out. He arrives and hooks up with mayorRachel Wando (played by Linda Hamilton) who shows him around. The moviespends some time getting to know Rachel, Harry, his colleagues, and thetown. The characters are likeable, largely because Brosnan and Hamiltonare so charismatic. And thankfully, as Andrea says, Rachel's kids aren'ttoo annoying, (as many movie kids are these days).  The movie really takes off, though, when the mountain blows. At firstthere is panic among the townspeople and the panic is well-staged. Quiteoften action sequences comprise a bunch of close-ups, cut together.(That's cheaper, easier, and less interesting than actually spendingtime to choreograph the sequence.) The confusion in Dante's Peak is notentirely created through editing. There are actually carefully stagedwide shots of townspeople running and driving amok. The freeway at theedge of town collapses and it looks like footage from the San Franciscoearthquake. A flood of water, ash, and logs sweeps down the mountain andit looks like footage from Mt. St. Helens. Harry Dalton (the character)is trapped in a cave-in and I fear for Pierce Brosnan's (the actor's)safety.  After the preliminary eruption, the main characters rush from onedangerous situation to the next, and each of these sequences is rivetingand frightening. The characters never do anything inhumanly stupid tobring the danger on themselves (as characters often do in horrormovies), but there's always one more dangerous situation for thecharacters to face. Having survived several close geologic encounters,Harry and Rachel try to drive down off the mountain, only to discoverthat the road is blocked by a lava flow. Driving on might get them stuckin lava, but turning around might trap them on a doomed mountain. Creditthe writing of Leslie Bohem for keeping these situations tense withoutfeeling contrived, and for including enough of these vignettes to keepthe pace moving.  I assume that most of these situations were computer generated (like theflood and the freeway collapse), and if it's true, these are the bestcomputer-generated graphics I have seen. They were crude at thebeginning of Dante's Peak (the peak is clearly inserted into thebackgrounds), interesting in Terminator 2 and passably believable inJurassic Park, but the flood scene in Dante's Peak looked frighteninglyreal and the freeway collapse had me riveted. They didn't workeverywhere, like when the lava burst though the back wall of the cabin,but perhaps for the first time, some of the computer graphics areseamless.  This movie was crafted and not slapped together. There is someinteresting camera work during the setup of the movie. The camera, intwo parallel shots started on the face of a character, then pulled backand swung around to reveal the whole scene. It's not much, but it showedme that some care and thought were put into the movie. There was nosuperheroism, no dumb luck, no coincidences, no token sex scenes, and noirrelevant pop music sprinkled in as an excuse for a soundtrack. Also,three PhDs were credited as advisors. I am not qualified to say if thescience was true to life, but it felt about right and it wasn'tcondescending.  Although this movie may be totally forgotten in five years, it is greatentertainment. ",Dante's Peak,PG-13,1997,1.5
234,"A colossal misfire, DAREDEVIL is the BATTLEFIELD EARTH of superhero films,which isn't surprising given its pairing of charisma-free actor Ben Affleck(PEARL HARBOR) with saccharine writer/director Mark Steven Johnson (SIMONBIRCH).  DAREDEVIL wants badly to be the next SPIDERMAN but fails miserablyat every turn Ben Affleck plays a comic book character who was blinded in childhood in anaccident which so heightened all of the rest of his senses and skills thathe can do anything a sighted person could do and much, much more.  Affleck'scharacter is known as a lawyer named Matt Murdock by day and as the maskedDaredevil by night.  Since his father (David Keith) was murdered when Mattwas young, Matt, as the Daredevil, lives to deliver vigilante justice and toseek revenge. The sappy and silly script has Matt sharing little messages with us.Typical of these trite little thoughts for the day are: ""Revenge won't makethe pain go away,"" ""There are days I believe, and other days that I've lostfaith,"" and ""Justice isn't a sin."" Filmed darkly and edited confusingly, the movie is quite uninviting.  Thedirector doesn't have a clue on how to direct an action picture so that ithas the requisite energy and proper pacing.  Only a good supporting castmakes the movie sometimes watchable.  Jennifer Garner plays Matt's sexy,superhero girlfriend, Elektra Natchios.  Michael Clarke Duncan is thesneeringly suave, big bad guy named Kingpin.  Colin Farrell plays Bullseye,Daredevil's cocksure opponent.  And Jon Favreau turns in a fun littleperformance as Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson, Matt's law partner.  Foggy's maininterest is getting someone to admit that the alligators-in-the-sewer urbanlegend is true. Now for the big question.  Will there be a DAREDEVIL 2?  I'm afraid so. DAREDEVIL runs 1:43.  It is rated PG-13 for ""action/violence and somesensuality"" and would be acceptable for teenagers.  My son Jeffrey, almost 14, gave it *** 1/2.

235,"The original, more provocative title for ""Dark Blue"" was ""The PlagueSeason,"" based on a story by James Ellroy (1997's ""L.A. Confidential"").Its inexplicable switch to the generic, mostly forgettable new monikeris a minor point, to be sure, but also telling. Directed by Ron Shelton(1999's ""Play It to the Bone""), ""Dark Blue"" is grim and unblinkingin its depiction of a group of severely crooked L.A. cops, and toplinedby the vastly underrated Kurt Russell (2001's ""3000 Miles to Graceland"").It also too often acceptantly spins its wheels as it unspools a narrativeoften as shopworn as its title.  Set during the days leading up to the verdict of the March 1991 RodneyKing trial and L.A. riots, Special Investigations Squad detectiveEldon Perry (Kurt Russell) and partnered protege Bobby Keough (ScottSpeedman) are assigned a quadruple homicide that took place in a conveniencestore. Through the investigation, Perry unflinchingly introduces Keoughto the blatant misconduct and corruption running rampant through theirdivision, headed by Sergeant Jack Van Meter (Brendan Gleeson). Andas the stakes rise and Deputy Chief Arthur Holland (Ving Rhames) setsout to uncover their misdoings, Perry finds himself on a downwardspiral of illegal activity that has stripped him of not only his morals,but his beloved wife, Sally (Lolita Davidovich), and teenage son (Wyatt Russell). ""Dark Blue"" is effectively gritty when need be, but for most of itsrunning time meanders as it tries to find its central story arc. ScreenwriterDavid Ayer (2001's quite similar and better ""Training Day"") and directorRon Shelton are adept in the how's and why's of the SIS unit, no matterhow fictionalized it may be, and offer an intriguing background layerin its palpably felt and crucial 1991 setting. There is also a slam-bangconclusion that savvily finds the morals within its touchy issues without getting preachy. What is not so good, then, is the picture's lack of focus and originality.A feud between Perry and Holland brought up in its first half turnsout to only be a disconcerting red herring, while the lack of a virtuouslead character makes one question who he or she should be rootingfor and why they should care. Meanwhile, the police procedural elementhas ""been-there-done-that"" written all over it. Until the final thirtyminutes, there is little energy in the plot machinations, and thecharacters have trouble breaking free from the one-note ""types"" theyhave been written to portray. Perry is the antihero--a man who realizesnearly before its too late the mistakes he has made. Keough is therookie investigator initially forced into participating in the corruptionbefore he decides to come clean. Jack Van Meter is the head of SISso crooked in his dealings it's amazing he doesn't have a neon signplastered to his forehead. And Sally is the long-suffering wife ofPerry who, despite being written with more intelligence than the norm,is nothing more than a device at the service of the story. Kurt Russell snaps and crackles in the highly charged role of EldonPerry. While Perry is far from the most noble of men, Russell is alikably charismatic enough performer that it is easy to connect tohis plight. Scott Speedman (2000's ""Duets""), on the other hand, isbadly miscast as the distraught and confused Bobby Keough. Speedmanis soft-spoken and looks so squeaky clean that he appears to be playingdress-up rather than inhabiting an actual character. As Arthur Holland,Ving Rhames (1999's ""Bringing Out the Dead"") merely cashes a paycheck.On hand for obligatory femme support are Lolita Davidovich (1999's""Mystery, Alaska""), quite memorable with sparse screen time, and MichaelMichele (2003's ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days""), as a fellow officerwho also happens to be Keough's aloof mistress. ""Dark Blue"" is average and unremarkable in nearly every way, palingnext to ""Training Day,"" which it closely resembles. If there is areason to see the film at all, it is for Kurt Russell's powerhouseperformance, but that is simply not reason enough to wade throughmaterial that has been seen too many times in the past to count.",Dark Blue,R,2003,2
236," John Murdoch (Sewell) awakens alone in a strange hotel to find that he iswanted for a series of brutal murders. The problem is that he can't rememberwhether he committed the murders or not. In fact, most of his memories havecompletely vanished, and for one brief moment, he is convinced that he hasgone stark raving mad. Pursued by Detective Bumstead (Hurt), Murdoch seeksto unravel the twisted riddle of his identity. As he edges closer to solvingthe mystery, he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld controlled by a group ofominous beings collectively known as The Strangers . These shadow-like,soulless creatures are on a quest to emulate humanity. They control DarkCity, freezing  time every night to rearrange the skyline and warp everyresident's mind to find out what  makes us ""tick"". These gothic figurespossess the ability to alter people's perceptions, by changing theirmemories -- a process known as Tuning. Through an evolutionary anomaly,Murdoch is also imbued with this power and thus, he alone is able to resistThe Stangers' control over his mind.. And for that, he must be destroyed.With the help of the inscrutable Doctor Schreber (Sutherland), Murdoch isable to stay a step ahead of his adversaries while he slowly pieces togetherthe labyrinthine puzzle of his past -- his bittersweet childhood, his lovefor his estranged wife Emma (Connelly) and the key to a hideous series ofmurders which he is suspected of committing.  Eternal night, strange skyscrapers that morph from the ground, while theunknowing citizens get their memories changed every 24 hours. This is asurreal, bizarre and effectively paranoid sci-fi thriller that will pleasethe neo-noir fans. Unlike most of the films of its genre, ""Dark City"" doesnot have any action sequences or endless gunfights. It is more like a dark and moody meditation. What makes us human? What is individuality? Is itsimply a collection of memories that make us what we are? Will a man thathas got memories of a killer continue the horrifying practice? Or is itsomething deeper, something you can not change, take or label? Is that whatwe call soul?  In a film like this, atmosphere is the key. Alex Proyas understands that.Directing with as little light as possible and using only the shades ofgray, black and dark green, he manages to create a cold and unfriendlyworld, which is a bizarre mixture of countless time periods and ages - aworld of eternal night, lit up only by the colorful memories. This world ismore like a zoo - a laboratory where it is we who are being researched by asuperior and far more advanced race.  Visually the film is remarkable, presenting a graceful cinematography,gothic architecture, '50s costumes, interesting art direction and a dose ofimpressive special effects. The acting is also a key factor and it isnothing more than acceptable, although it is impossible to call any of theperformances spectacular. Regrettably the characters in ""Dark City"" are notvery developed and there are some disturbing holes in the plot, that somewill find disturbing. After a spectacular and completely unexpectedrevelation that lifts the film to new hight, the finale that follows israther disappointing, simplified and almost alienated from the rest of thepicture.  This film has received a rather cold welcome from the critics and wasunderrated and overseen for no reason. Several failures during these 100minutes, prevent me from giving this film a top mark. However, this is trulya thrilling and inspiring production, that will probably stand as an exampleof a good science fiction film in the years that come. ",Dark City,R,1998,2.5
237,"""The Day After Tomorrow"" is writer-director Roland Emmerich's fourthchance to do justice to the science-fiction genre (after 1994's boderline-plagiaristic""Stargate,"" 1996's insipid and corny ""Independence Day,"" and 1998'sjust-plain-bad ""Godzilla""), and he is no closer to succeeding at makinga smart, taut, well-written motion picture than he was ten years ago.Even his attempt at historical drama, 2000's ""The Patriot,"" was apreachy, flag-waving bust. Through all five of these features, Emmerichhas had a knack for concocting grandly themed, highly accessible,intriguingly plotted films and then completely watering them downin wasted potential, giant cliches, and ridicule-worthy scripting.""The Day After Tomorrow"" reminds of the Irwin Allen films of the '70s(i.e. ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""The Towering Inferno""), but exemptof their undeniable fun factor and sharper-than-usual character depth.As cheesy as Allen's oeuvre may have been, they were an example ofgreat subtlety and plausibility in comparison to what Emmerich's slick,empty, and often laughable latest production has to offer. Just days after climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) warns thatglobal warming may be only fifty to one-hundred years away, the world'snorthern hemisphere is suddenly stricken by massive hurricanes, floods,and blizzards, destroying entire cities in their wake. With his teenageson, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), off in Manhattan at a scholastic competitionwhen catastrophe hits, Jack promises Sam that he will make it fromD.C. to New York to save him, no matter what. In order to do this,however, Jack and Sam will both have to fight for survival as thenew Ice Age, taking temperatures down to 150 degrees below zero, approaches. An environmental cautionary tale and a big-budget, special effects-ladendisaster flick, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" takes a potentially thought-provokingpremise and flounders the results miserably. The most treacherousculprit is the asinine screenplay by Roland Emmerich and Jeffrey Nachmanoff,which not only steals from Emmerich's own ""Independence Day,"" butis more than content to parade out an endless, ever-wearying lineof cliches, ludicrous plotting and dialogue, and paper-thin stockcharacters whom the viewer forms no relationship with. There's a friendlybum (Glenn Plummer) and his trusty dog. There's a dedicated nurse(Sela Ward) who sacrifices her own safety for a young cancer patient.There's a news anchor on the streets of Hollywood who does his reportfeet away from one of the cyclones ravaging the city (he gets whathe deserves in the long run for being so stupid). There's even a threadbareromantic subplot between Sam and cute classmate Laura (Emmy Rossum)that is actually brought up in an earnest, calm fashion by anothercharacter mere seconds after they all were nearly wiped out in a tidalwave. When the fatally cold temperatures hit, turning people intofrozen popsicles in mere seconds, the lead actors conveniently areable to escape such maladies by simply closing the door of a buildingor taking shelter in a flimsy tent. Yes, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is the kind of movie one should checktheir brain at the door of, but is it too much to ask to treat thesubject matter with some form of maturity and realism? Even a setof laid ground rules would have helped had director Emmerich not violatedthem whenever it was convenient to the plot. Instead, he condescendsto his audience by expecting them to be dimwits with IQ's in the singledigits. The consistent, innumerable flaws found in the writing blockmost of the cathartic entertainment value that might have been hadfrom the story. Disappointing, also, is how briefly and vaguely theweather disasters are portrayed onscreen. After a five minute scenecentering on the destruction of Los Angeles by tornadoes (and includingthe obligatory shot of the Hollywood sign being ripped to shreds),the city is never seen or heard from again. The majority of the seendisasters occur in Manhattan (very few other places being torn apartin the world are glimpsed), but again, it is over nearly before itbegins. With most of the action set-pieces and money shots exhaustedby the end of the first hour, Roland Emmerich's largest hindranceis exposed. With no development placed on the characters and theirrelationships outside of the rudimentary, there is nothing to carrythe viewer through the long, slow, monotonous second half. Focus alternatesbetween Sam, as he takes shelter in a library, and Jack, who bravesthe snow and frigid temperatures to trek hundreds of miles (by foot)to reach his son. The film forgets to give us a reason to care, andits negligence in building real personalities for its stick charactersonly makes the subdued final hour all the more patience-testing. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" has the possibility of becoming a camp classicfor its failure to accumulate intended laughs while somehow turningits more serious moments into genuine howlers. The exception is itsheavy-handed but still effective jabs at today's ailing politicalclimate. The President of the United States (Perry King) is portrayed,intentionally like George W. Bush, as a useless figure who relieson everyone else to tell him what to do, while the Vice President(Kenneth Walsh) isn't seen in a much more positive light. When mostmovies portray politicians with honorability and intelligent, it isrefreshing to finally see one that acknowledges their flaws and deniessugarcoating. It is too bad, then, that the rest of the picture isn'tnearly as astute or canny. The usually great actors, particularlyDennis Quaid (2003's ""Cold Creek Manor"") and Jake Gyllenhaal (2002's""The Good Girl""), struggle to keep straight faces while having torecite such cornball dialogue it is amazing no one realized how badit was while they filmed it. The visual effects in ""The Day After Tomorrow "" are professional eye-candy,and the tidal wave sequence is good for a few valid thrills, but thatis where the excitement ends. Most of the running time is merely plodding,and the film's portrayal of a frozen Manhattan wasteland was far morechilling and convincing in 2001's brilliant ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.""Likewise, the twisters in 1996's ""Twister"" were better. Regrettably,the film even pales in comparison to ""Independence Day,"" which wasalso just one stereotypical, creatively discouraging moment afterthe next, but at least felt like its scope was larger. So much couldhave been done with the ingenious premise of global warming. The tragedyof ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is that it does nothing at all with theseboundless story possibilities, happy to be lazy and patronizing, instead.Mr. Emmerich„you've officially just struck out.","Day After Tomorrow, The",PG-13,2004,2
238,"      A decade ago, when I worked for Apple, there was a group ofsoftware designers who regularly went en masse to a select movie genre.They picked out shows sure to be terrible and then had a great timelaughing in unison at them.  I thought of this group as I sufferedthrough Sylvester Stallone latest action thriller, DAYLIGHT.  I lostcount of how many times I laughed out loud at the wrong places.Characters were dying, and I could not keep from laughing; thecircumstances were so ridiculous.       One could make a cogent argument that action films should beevaluated mainly on the special effects and the stunts.  By thatmetric, DAYLIGHT delivers.  Not a great special effects movie, but aperfectly acceptable one.  In the best part, a firestorm barbecueseverything in its path.  Not quite as impressive as in CHAIN REACTION,but still pretty awesome.  Personally, I found the action sequences inDAYLIGHT more tedious than exhilarating, but maybe I am too demanding.       DAYLIGHT is set in a gritty New York City, where we see its castesystem.  Society is dichotomized into the superrich and the strugglingunderclass.  On the upper end of the scale, is the founder of anathletic clothing company.  He drives a Hummer and believes himself tobe invincible.  At the other end is a struggling playwright, MadelyneThompson (Amy Brenneman from CASPER and FEAR).  Her freezing coldapartment has cockroaches on her kitchen counter and rats in her sockdrawer.  Go ahead, guess which one of these characters will survive andwhich will perish.       In a cliche infested story, we have a convoy of truckers takingtoxic waste through the Holland Tunnel on way to New Jersey to dump it.Also in the tunnel are a bus load of convicts and cars full of assortedother inhabitants of The Big Apple.       Three kids with wildly colored hair and conspicuous body jewelryrob a diamond messenger and steal his car.  In my favorite scene in theshow, he sends a threatening fax to his stolen car.  Now, there is aconcept -- faxes as car burglar alarm replacements.  To evade thepolice the driver takes the Holland Tunnel, driving as though on aKamikaze mission.  So wild-eyed is the driver that, as he hits everycar in the tunnel, I began to wonder if the film was intended as aparody of bad action movies.  The car, of course, takes a flying leapinto the drums of toxic waste, causing the obligatory explosion andtrapping a stratified cross section of the city's citizens.       Near the entrance to the tunnel is limo driver Kit Lauria(Stallone).  Kit used to be the head of New York City's EmergencyMedical Services, but he tried too hard to save some people and failed.In the ensuing scandal, he was fired.  In charge now is a gung-ho newchief ""from California.""  When his troops do not agree with his tunnelrescue plan, he barks at them, ""You listen to me.  The person who saysit can't be done is always interrupted by the person who just did it.""The script by Leslie Bohem (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5) is full of suchinanities.  Soon our California macho man is toast, and Kit comes tosave the day.       They should have a place for you to check your brain in the lobbyof the theater.  I lost count of all the nonsensical parts.  Considerjust two typical examples.       First, the only way to enter the tunnel is for Kit to go through aset of twenty foot wide exhaust fans.  The fans are computer controlledand can be stopped only once and for just three minutes.  After that,there is no way to stop them ever again.  No computer command and noway to cut the power.  Sure.       Second, the characters are warned about the dangers of hypothermiasince they spend most of their time in the 37 degree water.  How manytimes do they get cold?  Once.       Perhaps the least believable character is the bureaucrat who wantsto take an action that will kill the trapped survivors.  Her motivationis to relieve the traffic congestion the explosion has caused.  Sheexplains, ""The tunnel is an artery.  The city is bleeding.""       The seriousness which director Rob Cohen (DRAGONHEART) attaches tothis farce could be summed up by one of the convicts.  While deathseems imminent, Vincent, played by Stallone's son Sage, starts puttingthe moves on another woman trapped in the tunnel.  He asks, ""Listen, ifwe don't die in here, I wondered if I could give you a call?""       DAYLIGHT runs too long at 1:55.  It is rated PG-13 for numerousscenes of death and destruction.  If your kids can not handle heavyviolence, do not take them to this show.  My guess is that this meansthe film is not for anyone under at least ten.  I enjoyed laughing atthe ludicrousness of the picture, but I would not suggest that anyoneelse have to sit through this preposterous story.  I give the movie *1/2 only for the action sequences. ",Daylight,PG-13,1996,1.5
239,"      DEAD MAN WALKING is a carefully crafted filmed by writer,director, and co-producer Tim Robbins.  It tells the story of aconvicted murder and rapist named Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn).  He hasbeen on death row in Louisiana for six years and is soon to be executedafter numerous appeals to the state and federal courts.  DEAD MANWALKING is purported to be an evenhanded view of both sides of thecapital punishment issue.  More on how successful the film is at thatlater in the review.  This show is much more than a message movie, andit contains some incredible performances.  Whether your feelings on thedeath penalty are strong one way or another or even if you simply don'thave an opinion, this film will move you and challenge you to thinkabout your beliefs and values.       The movie is based on an autobiography by Sister Helen Prejean.The characters in the story are not real, but rather are fictionalcompositions of similar ones she has known.  Susan Sarandon playsSister Helen and getting to know her through Saradon's Academy Awardquality performance makes your time at the movies special.  The manyother marvelous aspects to the film enhance your movie going experienceeven more.       Matthew Poncelet committed his crime in 1988.  He and his buddyfound two teenagers kissing in a car in a wooded lovers lane area.They pulled them out of the car, raped the girl, viciously stabbed themand then shot them in the back of the head.  As a teenager, I once hada stranger try to come into my car in the same circumstance and in asimilar wooded place.  We got away, but even today I am frighten when Ithink about what could have happened.  Certainly for me, this movierang true, and it was easy to identify with the victims.  As a parent,it was also even to identify with the parents in the movie.  Chillingreal.       Sister Helen works in a poor black ghetto, but gets a letter fromPoncelet in prison and goes to visit him.  She is scared and uneasy inher first visit ever to a prison, but agrees to help him file newappeals and find him a new lawyer.  In this and every scene Sarandon isnothing short of incredible.  She manages to be reserved, but show heremotion with her expressions and her soft but effective speech.  Otheractresses and other directors would have overdone the nun's role.  Hereher outward uneasiness and trepidation is conquered by her innercourage.  A tour de force acting performance by Sarandon.       Penn is terrific as a prisoner.  Watch especially how downcast hiseyes are and how fidgety he is.  The audience is quickly convinced thatthis guy did it.  Nevertheless, he claims he only watched while hisbuddy did the rape and the murders.  His buddy, of course, claims justthe opposite is true.  On one level the movie is about whether Ponceletwill get his execution postponed and whether he really did it or not.Most of the film however reminded me more of MY DINNER WITH ANDRE thanany other film.  Sister Helen and Poncelet have long conversationsabout everything from racism to Jesus and salvation.       The director sets a slow and deliberate pace where there are a lotof natural pauses in the conversations.  In a mediocre movie, thistechnique is the kiss of death as it rapidly gives rise to boredom, buthere it allows the audience to contemplate the meaning of the excellentscript.  The sound effects editing of the movie is unusual.  There islittle ambient noise in most scenes causing the dialog to beaccentuated much as a room with only a single picture focuses theviewer attention on it.       The movie shows the nuns as real people who are not afraid tolaugh, and the script has several quite natural jokes.  When SisterHelen gets stopped by a state trooper (Clancy Brown from THE SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION), he says, ""You're a nun.  I gave a ticket to an IRS agentone time.  I got audited the next year.  I don't think I'll give you aticket.""       The actors and actresses playing the victim's families (Raymond J.Barry, R. Lee Ermey, etc.) are some of the strongest minor characters Ihave seen in a long time.  Their discussions of why there should be adeath penalty contribute to the picture's attempt at evenhandedness.The Academy Award quality editing (Lisa Zeno Churgin) provides anotherpro-death penalty argument.  It is hard to watch the flashbacks of therape and the murders interlaced with photos of the victims growing upand not want Poncelet to die.  On the other hand, I still think thescript and most of the movie is so sympathetic to the killer that is aflawed attempt at evenhandedness.  The audience ends up wanting thekiller to live.  There was major weeping in my audience.       I did not find Robert Prosky's role as lawyer Hilton Barber veryeffective.  He gave his usual performance unchanged from many othermovies he has been in.  Clearly the weakest character of the lot.       The script is brilliant.  There so many examples that is hard toknow where to start.  When Sister Helen first meets Poncelet and hecomes on to her, she tells him, ""Look at you.  Death is looking downyour neck, and you're playing your little male come on games.""  Themother of the girl victim speaking about the last time she saw herdaughter says, ""You don't know when a child leaves, it will be the lasttime you'll ever see her again.  If I'd known this, I'd of told her Iloved her.""  When Sister Helen asks Poncelet if he isn't sorry for theparents of the victim, he answers that ""It's hard to have much sympathywith the parents when they are trying to kill me"".  Toward the end hetells Sister Helen, ""It's quiet.  Only three days left.  Plenty of timeto read my Bible and look for a loophole.""  When the male victim'sfather asks Sister Helen how she has the faith to do what she does, shereplies, ""It's not faith, its work.""       The cinematography (Roger Deakins) is slow, deliberate, andintimate just like the script.  Watch especially how the camera movesduring the naturally lit scenes in the victims' houses.  The sets(Richard Hoover) and the costumes (Renee Ehrlich Kalfus) are extremelyaccurate in recreating poor Southern whites and their houses.  Penn'sattire and make-up help create his character before he even speaks.There is little use of music (David Robbins), but what there is has awonderful reverential feel.       I had two guys sitting behind me talking some.  When I realizedthey looked like the death row inmates in the movie, I decided I wouldlet them talk without interruption.       I do have some criticisms of the movie.  First, it is toosympathetic to the killer.  Watch how they make him into Christ at theend.  Second, the black ghetto was made to seem like too much fun.  Itwas full of happy people on the streets and has churches filled tooverflowing with people singing and dancing.  I have been to ghettosbefore, and Robbin's vision is not realistic.  Third, the lawyer claimsthat Poncelet's chances are a thousand to one.  Given the large ratioof people on death row to those actually ever executed, the odds arethat most convicted killers will never be executed even if there areinitially sentenced to die.  Finally, having Poncelet be such a racistthat he gets on TV while he is trying to get the governor to pardon himand proclaim that, ""Hitler was on the right track that the Aryan wasthe master race,"" is a bit much hard to belief.  I think in thosecircumstances, he would have held his tongue.       DEAD MAN WALKING runs an absorbing but slow and deliberately paced2:02.  I would not have changed the pacing at all, and I hope to seethe editor win lots of awards.  It is rated R for rape and murder.  Itis a realistic show, but should be fine for teenagers interested inserious material.  I strongly recommend this film to you, and I giveit *** 1/2. ",Dead Man Walking,R,1995,3.5
240,"       This tongue-in-cheek glimpse of college life is timed for theopening of classes and specifically aimed at its target audience -which is over 18 (because of its R-rating) and under 30 (after which,presumably, maturity beckons).  Given that window of view-ability,this quirky story is built around a popular urban legend. Namely, theobscure ""dead man's clause"" that goes: If your college roommatecommits suicide, you get straight A's for the semester.  Meet TomEverett Scott (""That Thing You Do!""), a former honor student onscholarship, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (TV's ""Saved by the Bell), ahard-core party animal. After a couple of months of drugs, drink, andcasual sex, they're flunking freshmen who realize that this obscureloophole, buried in the college charter, may be their only hope ofstaying in school. Forced to take desperate measures, they embark on ableak mission to recruit the most emotionally unstable people oncampus to agree to move in to their three-man dormitory suite and thenfervently hope that one of them will commit suicide so they can gettheir automatic 4.0 grade average ""as a consolation prize."" Thecandidates include a paranoid computer whiz (Randy Perlstein) who isconvinced Bill Gates wants to steal his brain, a dour British punkrocker (Corey Page) with a death wish, and a manic, self-destructivefrat man (Lochlyn Munro) whose idea of chivalry is to unzip his flyand offer his services after he accidentally sets a co-ed's hair onfire. Directed by Alan Cohn from a satirical script concocted by aquartet of screenwriters, the murderous mischief consists entirely ofone-liner drivel, bathroom humor, and boisterous, childish pranks. Onthe Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Dead Man on Campus"" flunks with afunereal 3. What else would you expect from a demented comedy aboutsuicide? ",Dead Man on Campus,R,1998,1.5

A remote controlled toy, the jet black Corvette must have asouped-up engine since it can chase Harry's squad car with ease.  But it isn'tthe speed that spooks Inspector Harry Callahan; it's the lethal weapon hidinginside the innocent looking toy.  Once under the police car, it will blow Harryand his partner to smithereens.  THE DEAD POOL, the last of the five Dirty Harry movies, is being re-released onDVD with a new digital transfer in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary ofthe start of the series.  This time Harry is trying to stop a contest, nicknamedthe dead pool, in which people are betting on the death of various San Franciscocelebrities, including Harry.  Of all the Dirty Harry pictures, this one has the strongest supporting cast,which includes Patricia Clarkson as a pesky reporter, Liam Neeson as anavant-garde director and dead pool better and Jim Carrey as a soon-to-be-toastsatanic rocker and hard druggie.  Carrey is marvelously energetic and outrageousin one of his first films.  THE DEAD POOL was released in 1988, and it wasn'tuntil 1994 in ACE VENTURE: PET DETECTIVE and in THE MASK that Carrey's filmcareer really took off.  Carrey fans, of course, will remember one other wellknown film before THE DEAD POOL in which Carrey had a minor role -- 1986's PEGGYSUE GOT MARRIED.  The most disappointing part of the otherwise thoroughly enjoyable film is it'slack of classic Dirty Harry quotes.  Still there are a few choice ones -- thebest being an unprintable line about a fortune cookie.  Another concerns hisboss's lack of children.  ""Do you have any kids, lieutenant?,"" Harry asks. ""No,"" Lt. Ackerman (Michael Goodwin) replies.  ""Lucky for them,"" Harry tells himwith his classic deadpan look.  THE DEAD POOL runs 1:31.

242,"Back in college days the guys and I at my fraternity used totune the TV before dinner time to The Mickey Mouse Showfeaturing Mickey and the Mouskateers.  We did because, well,for a couple of reasons. We liked to make fun of the format of achildren's show, to sing along with the key refrain ""M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O-U-S-E.""  Later I got to think that maybe having fun at theshow's expense wasn't the real motivation.  Maybe we 20-year-olds, stressed out from midterms and finals and long, dulllectures in rooms holding 150 called for some really lightentertainment.  We actually got to enjoy the squeaky-cleanshow and never thought that there might be dark, nefariousforces at work such as connections with gangsters and evenmurderers.  Now, decades later, my innocence is destroyed.  Ina parody of kids' shows (which I never thought deserved to betaken apart the way Danny DeVito does in his new movie),""Death to Smoochy.""  ""Smoochy"" would have us believe thatproducers of kids' shows may be guilty of deeds running thegamut from taking bribes from parents to put their tots on TV toselling products going to bogus charities, actually fronts fororganized crime.     When you consider that DeVito is not only one of our mostentertaining actors (""Taxi,"" ""Romancing the Stone,"" ""ThrowMomma from the Train"") but has also directed some class actslike ""Hoffa"" and especially the biting and almost surreal ""TheWar of the Roses,"" we may wonder what motivated him to puthis name on such an irritating, abusive and actually pointless""satire"" as ""Death to Smoochy"" which sets up a straw man(children's shows, or all subjects) and knocks it down.  If his aimin using Adam Resnick's unsubtle script is to parody the genrethe way other productions such as ""Quiz Show"" have taken aimon the corruption behind the TV games, where is a shred ofevidence that such activity exists behind the scenes?       The big problem here is that the film is dumbed-down,patronizing an imagined audience that would not be able to sitstill and pay attention unless Anastas Michos' camera used themost garish colors not just occasionally but throughout themovie's 105 minutes without a single break.  The gangsters arecartoon cutoats, and Harvey Fierstein, so amazing in a stagedebut decades ago that introduced Matthew Broderick to theworld, is bloated and downright embarrassing to look at. Worstof all Robin Williams, endearing in ""Good Morning Vietnam"" and""Moscow on the Hudson"" has now reached a low in his career,just when you thought there was only up to go after his smarmyrole as the title character in ""Patch Adams,"" excruciatinglysentimental in ""What Dreams May Come"" and unsubtle in""Jakob the Liar.""     Robin Williams is featured as Rainbow Randolph, akaSmoochy, a fun guy in a rhino costume with a top-rated TVshow who gets busted in a sting operation for accepting a bribefrom a ""parent"" who wants her kid on the show.  The sponsorslook for someone to save the program and go with a talent toproject its freedom from corruption and find their men in thethird-rate entertainer, Sheldon Mopes, because Mopes issqueaky clean.  A vegetarian and health faddist who believesthat while children's shows should entertain they should alsohave salubrious messages for the tots, he is conned by anagent, Burke (Danny DeVito), who is in cohoots with gangsters. Nora (Catherine Keener), the show's producer, is not aboveshady dealings herself and tries to move Sheldon into the realworld.     The movie is far from a complete loss.  Though I hated to seeRobin Williams as the incarnation of evil, an envious has-beendetermined to murder his replacement, some of the numbersare performed enthusiastically, so that we can understand whatthe children see in their hero and DeVito directs with a stronghand, keeping the action moving at a swift pace albeit withoutmuch time for a rest.  Edward Norton and Catherine Keenerhave zero chemistry as a love match, and while Keener doesnot have the kind of script she deserves (read: anything by NeilLaBute), she comes across as the only principal in the show with her feet on the ground.     If ""Death to Smoochy"" were aimed more directly at the sellingof shoddy, ephemeral, movie-related stuff by studio marketingdepartments, we'd have something to chew on. Maybe a sequelcould go after the movie theaters themselves that pushflagrantly overpriced popcorn and soda at the captive audience members who think that it's uncool to sit still without chompingaway while the stories unfold.  But this is not that picture. ",Death To Smoochy,R,2002,2
243,"      DEATH AND THE MAIDEN is Roman Polanski's latest film and itclearly has his stamp on it.  I find Polanski's movies always to besmartly written and directed.  He assumes that he has an audience whogoes to the movies with their thinking caps on, and his movies alwayssurprise you.  Sometimes the surprises come as unexpected twists in theplot (as in CHINATOWN or FRANTIC) and at other time in how harsh andintense the way the characters are drawn (as in BITTER MOON).  Finally,his movies can be so heavy that they are hard to watch.  If you areprone to nightmares, his movies provide fertile ground.  DEATH AND THEMAIDEN is all of the above.       The movie is set in a South American country, assumed to be Chile,where a democratic regime has taken over from a brutal dictatorship.The new Minister of Justice is played by Stuart Wilson.  His wife,played by Sigourney Weaver, was brutally and repeated tortured andraped by the old regime when she was a student activist.  The otheractor in this three-person play is Ben Kingsley.  He is a doctor, andhe may or may not have been Weaver's chief torturer.  The movie, madefrom a play, is about the mystery of whether Kingsley was the tortureror not.       The title DEATH AND THE MAIDEN comes from the name of a SchubertQuartet, and it plays a central thread that runs through the entireshow.  The opening scene is in a concert hall where this quartet isbeing performed.  The camera cuts from the tension of the violinstrings to the tension in Weaver's face and hands.  From there we skipto the isolated house on a peninsula where Weaver and her husband liveand where 99% of this claustrophobic movie takes place.       Kingsley brings Wilson home in a huge storm where they have lostpower and phone.  Soon Weaver becoming increasingly agitated decidesthat Kingsley was her torturer.  (Having recently spent over two daysat home in the mountains with no power or phone, with the only road outblocked and with several huge holes blown in our roof, I can speak fromsome authority in the isolation and irritation a situation like thiscan cause.)       For the rest of the movie you are not sure if she is going to killhim, torture him or what, but rest assured that it is a long night ofterror for the three leads and for the audience.  The well-writtenscript by Rafeal Yglesuas and Ariel Dorfman takes many twists.  Haveyourself some fun and try to guess the ending.  You will find there aremany possibilities from which to choose.       Weaver is an incredible actor who can play intense roles as inALIENS and comedic roles as in WORKING GIRL.  She is excellent here asone of the angriest and bitterest women you will ever meet.  She isangry at life and everyone in it including her husband.  You wonderearly on in the show why he would stay with someone so angry and mean,but as the plot develops you find out the reasons he puts up with thismiserable marriage.       Kingsley has the ambiguous and hence harder part.  Sometimes youthink he is a victim and other times you are convinced he is an animal.A fascinating piece of acting.  Wilson on the other hand is weak andgives a pedestrian performance.  He was rarely believable. ",Death and the Maiden,R,1995,2.5
244,"I first discussed Filipino culture with my high school class in theearly sixties.  We had read Lederer and Burdick's ""The UglyAmerican,"" whose title character is a U.S. diplomat in a foreignland who does not speak the language, and rather than mix withthe people of that underdeveloped country socializes strictly withfellow Americans living in their cloistered colony.  On the otherhand a group of locals in Manila who had just met an Americandiplomat expected him to be yet another ugly American butinstead, he spoke with them in Tagalog and at one point said, ""I'mhungry.  Where can I get some good adobe and pancit"" (theFilipine national dish)?  The locals were amazed and competedwith one another to invite him to their homes for dinner.     In ""The Debut,"" there is a reversal, if you will. The principalcharacter, despite being a strikingly handsome young man with areal talent for illustrating comic books, might be called The UglyFilipino-American"" in that he is ashamed of his culture.  In one ofthe first-ever Filipino-American films (this made for just $1.5million), Dante Basco inhabits the role of Ben Mercado, a fellowwho hangs out with an Anglo and a Mexican-American, both ofwhom are curious about Filipino culture. They do get a chance tosee it, of course, but if they listened to Ben who repeatedly triesto escort them out of his house and out of the party his 18-year-old sister is enjoying they would miss out on a chance to seesome down-home hospitality and some pretty cool dancing.       As in other coming-of-age stories, a parent is at odds with hisadolescent child. Ben's dad Roland (Tirso Cruz) is a postman witha secret, revealed late into the story.  He wants his kid to bebetter than he is and to become a doctor, hostile to the lad'sintentions to go to Cal-Tech to be an artist (which dad considers ahobby unsuitable for the real world).  This runs contrary to thetheme in a film opening at about the same time, ""Real WomenHave Curves,"" about a mother who is a seamstress (played by theinimitable Lupe Ontiveros) who actually discourages her daughterfrom dreams of college and incredibly enough wants her tobecome a seamstress in a sweatshop, just like her.     ""The Debut"" is predictable but is no sit-com, thanks to someremarkably believable acting by Dante Basco in the principal role. Director Gene Cajayon takes us from the obligatory frictionbetween father and son to the ""good daughter"" who insists thatshe is fine with a regular birthday party and does not need apretentious deb introduction to society.  Turning his nose up at hissister's party, Ben opts to chill with his two pals at a blastattended by an Anglo girl he thinks he likes.  But oh, what hewould have missed if he never returned to his roots.  Cajayonshows us an array of dancing at the party of sister Rose(Bernadette Balagtas).  There's a traditional one done withclacking bamboo sticks which is in a way like skipping rope inthat the women have to synchronize their steps lest their feet getcaught between the poles.  The evening moves from a cha-chaFilipino style into some exciting break dancing done by aprofessional troupe, and ends up with Ben's successfully hittingon a Filipino girl but not before gangsta wannabe Augusto picksfights with him for taking away his woman and accuses him ofbeing a sell-out, a coconut, for having no Filipino friends.     ""The Debut,"" then, is a debut in many ways.  First in that this isamong the first Fil-Am films; second in that much of the sceneryis taken up with a birthday party that simulates a low-budgetdebutante ball; third in that Ben is making his debut into Filipinosociety, finally accepting his racial and national heritage.  Thepicture somehow lacks the charm of ""Real Women Have Curves""but is heads-and-shoulders superior to the sit-comish butimmensely popular ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""  We wish Benthe best in art school: after all his invested all his savings in first-year tuition, turning down a scholarship at UCLA, and maybe he'lleven find a field like animation that can show dad that you canwhat you want and still make a buck. ","Debut, The",NR,2000,3
245,"      ""Six shrinks later, three wives down the line, and I still can'tget my life together,"" Harry Block tells his psychiatrist inDECONSTRUCTING HARRY.  Woody Allen, playing Harry as a parody ofhimself, is back.  With his usual self-deprecating humor, he spendscopious time with his shrink, and, as always, he obsesses over sex.  Athis son's grade school, Harry advises his little boy, ""The two mostimportant things are the work that you choose and sex.""       Woody surrounds himself with a cornucopia of friends (KirstieAlley, Richard Benjamin, Eric Bogosian, Billy Crystal, Judy Davis,Mariel Hemingway, Amy Irving, Julie Kavner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, DemiMoore, Elisabeth Shue, Stanley Tucci and Robin Williams amongothers),creating too much of a distraction as these excellent actorsparade through the movie.  The jumbled result is a frequently humorousshow -- although there are not as many big laughs as in most Allenfilms -- that disappoints as often as it surprises.  Still, a mediocreWoody Allen comedy is better than the best films of some directors.       As in THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, Allen plays games with reality andfiction and upsets the time-space continuum.  Harry Block is a writerof semi-autobiographical tales.  In one of the more interesting twists,most of the roles in the picture are played by two characters.  Thereare the movie's main characters and the ones from Harry's book andshort stories, who in turn are modeled on the main characters.       To complicate things further, Harry's stories constantly mockWoody Allen's recent troubles.  Harry describes himself, for example,as ""a guy who can't function well in life but can in art.""  Or as hispsychiatrist tells him, ""You expect the world to adapt to thedistortion you've become.""       DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is filled with vignettes of comedic anger,and, like most of Allen's works, it pokes fun at his fellow Jews.After several dozen movies, most of Allen's characters seem to berepeats from his previous movies.  The two fresh ones this time arenewcomer Hazelle Goodman's black hooker role and Robin Williams's fuzzypart.       Robin Williams plays a actor named Mel, who gets ""soft"" during thefilming of a movie.  He gets out of focus, and there is nothing theycan do to sharpen him up again.  (""Daddy's out of focus, Daddy's out offocus,"" his son taunts him.)       Woody looks older and more tired than ever in DECONSTRUCTINGHARRY, but he can still turn a phrase and create an unforgettableimage.  Although his recreation of hell with Billy Crystal as the devilshows no spark of creativity, his rendering of a Bar Mitzvah with aSTAR WARS theme does.       The lightweight story eventually runs out of gas and stops, but itprovides little to take away other than some fleeting humor.  Just ayear ago, Woody's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU proved that Woody stillpossesses his genius.  Let's hope for better things next time fromWoody than DECONSTRUCTING HARRY.       DECONSTRUCTING HARRY runs 1:35.  The film is rated R forprofanity, sex, brief nudity and some dope smoking.  It would be finefor older teenagers. ",Deconstructing Harry,R,1997,2.5
246," Before even seeing a single frame of the film, it would be easy to snickerat Deep Impact, in which a comet on a collision course with Earth threatensthe existence of all life on the planet.  It is the latest entry in thisdecade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film, and the first of two""the sky is falling"" flicks to hit screens this year (the other being thiscoming July's Armageddon, in which a meteor is the threat).  Its tagline,""Oceans Rise.  Cities fall.  Hope survives"" is not as cornball as that ofthe utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller Daylight (""They came inalone... the only way out... is together""), but it's every bit as treacly.  The opening moments of Deep Impact offer more to snicker at.  Thecheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions, such as theusual opening ""roll call,"" in which all the major characters and theirpersonal problems are introduced.  The most prominent of the ""personal""stories is that of ambitious TV news reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), whois distraught that her father (Maximilian Schell) left her mother (VanessaRedgrave) for a younger woman (Rya Kihlstedt).  What is just assnicker-worthy is how this co-venture between Paramount and DreamWorks SKGaggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration, Microsoftand NBC's cable news network MSNBC, which employs Jenny, who is the film'sostensible main character.  In the vision of America presented here, MSNBCis the television news source of choice in every home, when in reality itonly reaches a fraction of the country.  The initial signs point toward something along the lines of a Volcano orDante's Peak, but there's one thing about Deep Impact I underestimated: theskills of director Mimi Leder.  She won an Emmy for her helming work onNBC's smash ER, which is essentially a weekly disaster movie, each episodefeaturing a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medicalcrises.  The challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold:(1) to make the audience care for these guest characters, regardless of howbriefly seen or thinly written they are, and (2) powerfully tug at theemotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic.  Having passedthe ""ER challenge"" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creatingsuspense in The Peacemaker, Leder could not be a better fit to bringMichael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplayto screen.  As the countdown to impact progresses, the ominous feeling of doom ispalpable, leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing andaffecting emotional dimension.  There's nothing here that will profoundlymove anyone, but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is highachievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects.  Situationsthat initially feel contrived, such as Jenny's familial crisis and theteenage romance between Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski) and cometdiscoverer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood), achieve some poignance; and eventhe more vaguely drawn characters, including U.S. President Tom Beck(Morgan Freeman), astronaut Spurgeon ""Fish"" Tanner (Robert Duvall), and hisrather faceless crew (Ron Eldard, Jon Favreau, Mary McCormack, BlairUnderwood, and Alexander Baluyev) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraftMessiah, have their share of touching moments.  The latter fact owes a debtto the actors, who all do a solid job and are well-cast, with the possibleexception of Leoni; she delivers a decent performance, but her trademarkunconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard tobuy as a star news broadcaster.  Although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work (thegiant ocean waves are particularly spectacular) place Deep Impact in thesame category as the likes of Twister, it is the first of the '90s disasterfilms to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions thatring true--a film that makes a genuine impact, even if it isn't as deep ashoped. ",Deep Impact,PG-13,1998,3
247,"A modern-day, urban version of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew,""""Deliver Us From Eva"" is the second romantic comedy of the week (""Howto Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" being the other) that revolves around abet. The creaky conventions of such a story tell us that the person(s)involved in the bet start off trying to win somebody over as an assignment,but then--surprise, surprise--falls in love. And common knowledgetells us that when the other person finds out about the bet, theyfeel betrayed, have a bitter argument and break up, only to be wonback in the final scene by their sympathetic ex, who has learned theerror of his/her ways.  As with ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" ""Deliver Us from Eva"" runssmoothly and likably until a maddeningly dumbed-down and cloying finalethat sinks the entire film. And, as far as the Shakespeare sourcematerial goes, it was much more successfully updated in 1999's ""10Things I Hate About You"" (which, coincidentally, featured lead actressGabrielle Union in a supporting role). Union (2000's ""Bring It On"")and co-star LL Cool J (2002's ""Rollerball"") have an easy, charismaticrapport, but their brightly shaded performances are lost in a screenplaythat chooses sitcom-style plot developments over simple intelligence. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) is a stern, steely-edged healthy inspectorwho joyfully runs the lives of her younger sisters, Kareenah (EssenceAtkins), Jacqui (Meagan Good), and Bethany (Robinne Lee). Their husbandsand boyfriends--Mike (Duane Martin), Tim (Mel Jackson), and Darrell(Dartanyan Edmonds)--sick and tired of Eva butting into their lives,decide to hire smooth-talking player Ray (LL Cool J) for $5,000 towoo Eva and then intentionally drive her away (she has just been offereda job in Chicago). Before long, Ray has peeled away Eva's chilly demeanorto find a beautifully charming young woman whom he genuinely likes. Directed by Gary Hardwick (2001's ""The Brothers""), ""Deliver Us fromEva"" is surprisingly tolerable for its first 80 minutes--a littlerough around the edges with some awkward scene transitions, but modestlyenjoyable. As Eva, Gabrielle Union is the star attraction, and thenumber-one reason to even consider seeing the film. Union's role istricky--she has to outwardly seem like a scarily possessive controlfreak in the first half, and then reveal a charming softer side inthe second--and she pulls it off with a sly sense of humor and a three-dimensionalinterior. LL Cool J, although having less to do, is a well-cast romanticfoil as Ray. The subplots between the other three sisters and theirpartners is uninteresting, lazy, and would have been best had it beenleft on the cutting room floor. The actors are okay, but none of themmanage to stand out or adequately humanize their roles. That's when the end arrives, and James Iver Mattson, B. E. Braunerand Gary Hardwick derail their screenplay with a preposterous plotdevelopment and an unforgivably lame last scene. You know the kind:when a group of complete strangers miraculously show up to cheer onthe rekindling romance of the protagonists, spouting off a few cutesy,cheeseball lines before the camera cranes upwards and the end creditsroll. Watching this last act play out, how could anyone believe thatit successfully remains truthful to the plot or its central romance(or, for that matter, to the real world)? Whatever time and interestthe viewer has staked in the central relationship is lost by the clumsymishandling of the climax. And if you believe that I have unfairlyspoiled the ending of ""Deliver Us From Eva,"" then you've obviouslynever seen a generic romantic comedy before in your life.",Deliver Us From Eva,R,2003,2
248," ""Machines are going to fail,"" Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) warns EdGentry (Jon Voight).  ""Systems are going to fail.  Then survival.""  No, he's not talking about the year 2000 software problem.  In directorJohn Boorman's classic 1972 film, Lewis is generally weary of everythingelectrical and mechanical.  He's a macho, but pensive, guy who is takingthree of his buddies, Ed, Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) and Drew Ballinger(Ronny Cox), on a canoe trip down a wild river.  A manmade lake willsoon bury the river, so they will be among the last people who get toride down it.  DELIVERANCE is a chilling tale of the four men's fightagainst evil men, the forces of nature and their own limitations ashumans.  Famous, Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond (CLOSE ENCOUNTERSOF THE THIRD KIND), in San Jose to accept the Maverick Spirit Award fromSan Jose's Cinequest Film Festival, chose DELIVERANCE as the movie hewanted to show after receiving his award.  Before the movie he spoke about its filming, telling us how physicallyexhausting the shoot was.  They had to take canoes every day to get tothe filming location.  Because of the danger, they had planned to usestuntmen extensively, but the footage that made it into the final cuthas the stuntmen in only a few, brief, rock climbing scenes.  They made a decision to film all of the river scenes only on overcastdays, so they could get just the right threatening look that theywanted.  This was a financial risk since they had no idea if they wouldget enough overcast days.  Sometimes they had to wait for hours for alittle cloud to block out the sun before they could roll the cameras.  Another consideration was where to mount the cameras during the keyscenes on the river.  After several experiments, they found thatenclosing them in plastic and mounting them as close to water level aspossible produced the best results.  In addition they used long lenseswhich magnified the effect of the speed and the action, thusintensifying the drama.  The movie opens disarmingly as Drew, on his guitar, plays agood-spirited, impromptu duet with a young, backwoods, mountain boyplaying his banjo.  This hauntingly tranquil banjo music will reappearperiodically during the movie as will scenes of the placid sections ofthe river.  And there will be peaceful shots of roaring campfires and ofthe river at twilight, all to provide sharp contrast to the horror oftheir journey.  When things first go just slightly wrong, Ed suggests that they playgolf instead of taking the canoeing vacation -- advice that they willall wish that they had taken.  When they finally venture out on theriver, Bobby has a simple question.  ""Which way we goin'?"" the neophyteasks.  ""I think downstream would be best, don't you?"" quips Lewis.  Having Zsigmond present at the screening made us more conscious thannormal about the cinematography.  Even though we were watching a washedout, old print, the brilliance of his techniques were still easy torecognize.  Consider just two examples.  As Lewis drives his car way toofast through the dense woods, frightening Ed, Zsigmond lets their facesbe partially obscured by fast moving leaves reflecting on thewindshield, thus making the speed seem palpably dangerous.  In theburial scene, Zsigmond shows how the men are reduced to animals.Focusing in on their hands and faces as they dig the grave, the oncecivilized men have been reduced to their basest instincts.  The viscerally gripping film, which begins with a foreboding peace, endswith a frightening one.  All appears well, but it isn't and never willbe for the men who survive.  They will forever after be haunted bynightmares of their journey.  DELIVERENCE runs 1:49.  It is rated R for intense violence, graphic goreand rape and should be considered NC-17, a rating that they did not haveat the time of the movie's release. ",Deliverance,R,1972,3.5
249,"      DENISE CALLS UP is a claustrophobic, but carefully executed onejoke movie.  Within the strict confines of the show's unusual format,writer and director Hal Salwen creates a movie that does the mostpossible given the script's rigid adherence to its design.  Even givenits inherent limitations, it is interesting, unique, and thoughtprovoking.  Still, I feel I should warn you that its repetition and itscircular story may make all but the most dedicated cinema buffs alittle dizzy.       DENISE CALLS UP takes place solely in the world of thetelecommuters.  Remember the scene in BYE BYE BIRDIE where everyonetalks on the telephone in individual rooms?  Well, in DENISE CALLS UP,everyone is in their own homes working and periodically chatting withtheir friends.  What they never ever do is actually leave to meet anyof them.  They promise to meet, they throw parties, and they arrangeblind dates, but they all fashion different excuses so they can allstay within the safe confines of their homes.       The movie is populated by a world of troglodytes who are afraid ofhuman contact.  They like talking, but actual human interaction is toofrightening, better to stick to intimate relationships with theirphones and their computers.  Besides Homo sapiens, the picture isfilled with every type of phone and computer imaginable.  All of thephones have call waiting and much of the show consists of A talking toB, who then gets a call from C causing B to put A on hold.  C then getsa call from D.  You get the idea.  In order to arrange blind dates witheach other they fax around pictures of the last time they have actuallyseen each other, which is in school.       They take calls while on the toilet.  Sometimes they read whiletalking on the toilet, but other times they work on their laptops whilethere.  Barbara (Caroleen Feeney) hangs up on potential blind date,Jerry (Liev Schreiber), because she does not mind talking with hercoworkers or business clients while on the toilet, and using herlaptop, but she draws the line at non-business people whom she does notyet know.       There is no central character, but the name of the show comes froma scene where Martin Wiener (Dan Gunther) is called by a woman, Denise(Alanna Ubach), on a bus on her cell phone.  Although he has never mether, it seems she is having his baby since she got his sperm from asperm bank.  The on-going joke is whether they or any other of thecouples in the show ever meet or will they confine their relationshipto words spoken on the phone.       The quick cuts by editor Gary Sharfin and the tone set by thedirector make the movie feel highly improvisational.  This means somesilly lines will be followed by some excellent ones.       Gale (Dana Wheeler Nicholson) has Frank (Tim Daly) as anex-boyfriend whom she is always going to see again, someday.  She playsmatchmaker with Barbara and Jerry, but they keep putting each otheroff.  In a classic line, Barbara is talking on her car phone to Jerryand trying to convince him that is the reason she can't actually set adate for their date.  She says, ""I'm on  Park Ave.  See.  [She beepsher horn.]  I don't have my schedule.  I mean my primary schedule.  I'dhate to pencil you in and then find I have a discrepancy.""  Barbaradoes not understand it when her romance with Jerry doesn't work likeshe would like and so she sours on him proclaiming, ""He was so sweet inthe beginning, sending me little love faxes.""       The shallow and meaningless lives these people live consists ofconversations, phone sex, fear of commitment, and most of all, anabsolute phobia about physical human contact.  A phone is much safer.Better to have never actually met someone than be disappointed.  Whenthere is a death, you may be able to guess how, Frank consoles Linda(Aida Turturro) with, ""Don't feel bad.  Death is well, not foreveryone.""  These people have long since hung up on life so I am notsure why death is so hard for them to deal with.       Although the acting is fine, the reason to see this experimentalshow is to see how long they can keep these characters from evermeeting.  Will the whole show go on and every room have just a singlecharacter?  Will anyone risk meeting face-to-face?  Is having a babyenough to bring the parents together?  Will anyone come to Frank'sparty or will it be like Linda's where everyone promised to come andnot a single one showed?  I'm not telling.       DENISE CALLS UP runs just 1:21, but even shorter, it would havebeen better as the show does wear out its welcome a bit.  It is ratedPG-13.  There is no violence, no nudity, almost no bad language and thesex is strictly over the phone.  The picture is fine for teenagers andprobably for some kids a little younger.  I give the film a thumbs upand rate it ** 1/2. ",Denise Calls Up,PG-13,1996,2.5
250," Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is the sort of crass, crude, loudand generally unfunny low brow comedy that we have come to expect fromthe current crop of Saturday Night Live stars.  Fans of thedeliberately dumb style of humour perfected by Adam Sandler willprobably get a kick out of this rather juvenile, politically incorrectcomedy.  Sandler produced this comedy, which stars his friend RobSchneider, who played a small role as the pizza guy in Big Daddy.  Schneider plays the eponymous Deuce, a rather innocent,snivelling loser who cleans fish tanks for a living.  By chance hefinds himself minding a lavish apartment for Antoine (Oded Fehr), amale gigolo who has gone to Switzerland on business.  Antoine keeps alarge fish tank full of rare fish, and also collects antique weaponsthat are worth even more if they have actually been used to killsomeone.  But when Deuce accidentally breaks the tank and wrecks someof Antoine's precious furniture he is forced to come up with enoughcash in a hurry to repair the damage before Antoine returns home.  With the help of jive talking pimp TJ (Eddie Griffin), Deucereluctantly becomes a ""man whore.""  But things do not go smoothly forthe inexperienced Deuce.  Rather than have sex with his eccentricclientele (who are either overweight, gigantic, or suffer fromTourette's Syndrome), Deuce helps them become happy with their ownbodies and their unique problems.  Complications arise when he beginsto fall in love with Kate (Arija Bareikis), the one legged nurse whoworks in a hair donor clinic.  Mike Mitchell directs this nonsense with a remarkably heavyhand and a lack of subtlety.  The performances lack any sense ofnuance whatsoever.  Most surprising of all, however, is theunashamedly over the top performance from screen tough guy WilliamForsythe (The Waterdance, etc), who plays a vice squad cop obsessedwith his sexual failures.  There are some wonderful sight gags, and some rather obviousspoofs of recent movies, but there is precious little imagination atwork in the script, co-written by Schneider himself.  There is also apreponderance of tasteless innuendo, smut and puerile toilet humour,which may appeal to younger adolescent male audiences.  There is anemphasis on childish slapstick humour and pratfalls, but there arealso many moments that fall flat. ",Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,R,1999,2.5
251,"MGM can make all the excuses they want about why ""Deuces Wild,"" directedby Scott Kalvert (1995's ""The Basketball Diaries""), has been heldfor release for over a year, but the real reason is written all overthe screen. Cliched and poorly scripted (by Paul Kimatian and ChristopherGambale) to the point of ridicule, this is not good filmmaking. Set in Brooklyn, circa 1958, Leon (Stephen Dorff) and Bobby (BradRenfro) are brothers in a street gang by the name of the Deuces whohave been at odds with the Vipers ever since they killed their brotherthree years earlier. When the man responsible for his death, Marco(Norman Reedus), is released from prison, a war between the two gangsgoes into overdrive. Meanwhile, Bobby is torn between the faithfulnessof brotherhood and love when he meets and falls for Annie (FairuzaBalk), the sister of Vipers member Jimmy (Balthazar Getty). ""Deuces Wild"" is so reliant on stealing elements of other films, from""On the Waterfront"" to ""West Side Story"" to ""Romeo and Juliet,"" thatit could be accused of either plagiarism or camp. The problem withbuying the latter is that, despite the oft-embarrassing dialogue andshallow plot developments, director Scott Kalvert paints the filmas a serious melodrama. The result is anything but serious. While the Deuces are supposed to be the heroes of the story, how isone supposed to care or sympathize with a gang of troublemakers whoreally are no more redemptive than the spiteful Vipers? A group ofimmature delinquents, even Bobby, the film's protagonist, is seenbeating up a disabled person for no apparent reason within the opening five minutes.  The cast, made up of a who's-who list of talented young actors, aren'teven worthy of mention. All of the characters, save for a single exception,are written in a strictly one-note fashion. If a performer managesto rise above the muck, it is Fairuza Balk (2000's ""Almost Famous""),lighting up her thankfully frequent scenes as Bobby's new girlfriend,Annie. Annie is the only person in the picture with a modicum of sense,and Balk does well with what she is given.  For some mindboggling reason, director Kalvert displays a series ofrandom filmmaking techniques that are more laughable than stylish.Using slow-motion, at one point to an unintentionally funny effect,thunderstorms, fog, and flash cuts, the movie is even all over themap from a technical standpoint. While ""Deuces Wild"" manages to rejuvenateto life whenever the centerpiece is on Bobby and Annie's burgeoningrelationship amidst the chaos of street gangs and family problems,what surrounds them is clumsy and obvious. At best, ""Deuces Wild""is adequate direct-to-video fare. At worst, it's a horrifically bad theatrical release.",Deuces Wild,R,2002,1

253,"When you are at the height of fame on a television show or movie asa child, and then suddenly you hit puberty and can't get an actinggig to save your life, what becomes of you? For some, they turn todrugs. For others, they coast on their old celebrity status as ifnothing has changed. And for 37-year-old Dickie Roberts (David Spade),whose career came crashing down at the age of six when his televisionsitcom got canceled, he is determined to reclaim his moment in thespotlight. Working as a valet driver in Hollywood and with a materialisticgirlfriend, Cyndi (Alyssa Milano), Dickie catches wind of the auditionsfor a new Rob Reiner film and becomes obsessed with getting the part.Unfortunately, Reiner explains to Dickie that his casting is a longshot because he failed to experience a normal childhood. Unfaltered,Dickie puts an ad in the newspaper in which he will pay a family $20,000if they will adopt him for a month and treat him like a child. Thatfamily comes in the form of a tight-knit mother, Grace (Mary McCormack),son Sam (Scott Terra), and daughter Sally (Jenna Boyd), and a distantfather, George (Craig Bierko).   Directed by Sam Weisman (2001's ""What's the Worst That Could Happen?""),""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"" is the latest project from HappyMadison Productions (home of such comedians as Adam Sandler, who produces,and Rob Schneider), and it is not particularly any better or worsethan the average project from the company. For David Spade, however,it is a major step up from 2001's laughless ""Joe Dirt."" While mostof the physical comedy is lazy and predictable, such as a scene whereDickie crash-and-burns on a bicycle, what surrounds it is a surprisinglycharming diversion with a rather clever premise. Spade may not beable to juggle slapstick and drama as convincingly as Sandler or Schneider,but it is a smart career choice, moving him away from the lower rungsof the formulaic studio comedy where he has puttered for so long andinto something with just a little more substance than is the norm.   The film's in-jokes about the fleeting price of fame come fast andfurious, with its most witty moments bookending the bulk of the story.An outlandish but ironically believable ""E! True Hollywood Story""prologue is priceless, with Doris Roberts (TV's ""Everybody Loves Raymond"")making a cameo as Dickie's power-hungry stage mother. The end creditssequence is even more delightful, as a stream of real-life formerchild stars (see the cast listing above) stand on bleachers and singa choral ""We Are the World""-style song about being famous children.The song is increasingly crude and the scene itself curiously heartwarming,as the stars of yesterday stand united as they get the last laugh.Hearing Maureen McCormick (Marcia on ""The Brady Bunch"") drop the F-bombin her solo may just be worth the price of admission.   The middle 85 minutes is an admitted mixed bag, but it offers upjust enough good will and likable characters to make for an entertainingtime. While the movie offers up a lot of small chuckles, it lacksany really big laughs. And while some of the dialogue is sharply written,other lines feel awkward and certain jokes are repeated too many times,becoming repetitive and outstaying their welcome (Dickie's childhoodtelevision persona's tagline, ""It's Nucking Futs!"" being one of them).Where it makes up for this, in a screenplay by Fred Wolf and DavidSpade, is the truth it holds on its subject of child stars who becamehas-been's overnight. One suspects watching it that the experiencesDickie has as the success he once had constantly eludes him isn'tfar off from what, say, Corey Feldman and Corey Haim (both appearinghere, the former in a supporting role) have gone through.   In Dickie's burgeoning friendship with the family that adopts himis a sweet moral tale where both sides teach the other a thing ortwo about life. Weepy Hallmark moments arise in the climax once ortwice, but they are thankfully more subdued than they could have been.As mother Grace, who is neglected by her husband and who is taughtby Dickie how to stand up for herself, Mary McCormack (2002's ""FullFrontal"") brings a tender depth to a role that probably wasn't writtenwith as much precision. Scott Terra (2002's ""Eight Legged Freaks"")and Jenna Boyd (2003's ""The Hunted"") make for a solid team as brotherand sister Sam and Sally, who share nice chemistry with Spade. Unfortunately,the undervalued Alyssa Milano (a former child star in her own rightfrom TV''s ""Who's the Boss"") is stuck playing a one-dimensional shrewas Dickie's girlfriend, Cyndi. Much of her role glaringly must havemade it on the cutting room floor.   As a gut-busting comedy, ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"" doesnot really make the grade, but its well-intentioned sweetness andlighter shades of humor work well within the confines of its story.Its cameo list, meanwhile, is large and exhaustive, and the finalesing-along boasts a sly, inventive spark that a lesser throwaway moviemight not have even thought of. David Spade is far from the most talentedscreen comedians working today, and oftentimes his onscreen sincerityis easy to be mistaken for a wink to the camera, but ""Dickie Roberts:Former Child Star"" is a step closer to character growth. The role suits him. ",Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,PG-13,2003,2

For the first time, however, McClane doesn't have his wife,Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) to help him since Bedelia (best in HEART LIKE AWHEEL) had a salary dispute with the studio.  As a replacement helper,he gets a black Harlem shopkeeper called Zeus Carver (Samuel L.Jackson).       I am sorry to say that this DIE HARD tells the story of a madbomber who is blowing up large public buildings causing massivedestruction and who threatens to blow up even more if McClane and Zeusdo not follow his every instruction to the letter.  I say I am sorrybecause the horrors of the Oklahoma bombing were too fresh in my memoryto let me enjoy the special effects.  They were just too real.  On theother hand, most of my opinion of the movie would have been the sameeven if it were in not released in such close proximity to the Oklahomatragedy.       In this highly derivative movie, we have two plots.  One is takenfrom BATMAN and has to do with Simon's riddles (""who was 21 of 42""figure it out within 3 hours or hundreds of children die) and withchildhood (""shouldn't have done that, I didn't say 'Simon says'"").  Theother is a rehash of Die Hard 2 where McClane tries to figure out whatthe bad guys (Germans) are really up to.       DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE is directed by the same one, JohnMcTiernan, who did the original DIE HARD rather than DIE HARD 2's RennyHarlin.  The real different is the writer.  For the first time, we haveJonathan Hensleigh instead of Steven E. De Souza who was the leadwriter on the first two DIE HARDs.  De Souza is a much more seasonedwriter starting with his first movie, 48 HRS. whose success was atribute to his funny, intelligent and imaginative script as much as toEddie Murphy's acting debut.       The good news about this most recent DIE HARD is that we have lotsof action, some funny lines, great special effects of mass destruction,and exhilarating car chases.  The bad news is that you have seen andheard this all before in so many other movies.  The script has littlenew in it other than some new ways to destroy people and buildings.  Imust admit, I really did like the plot twist around the motive for thesecond major bombing.       As far as the acting goes, it was fine, but nothing fresh.  BruceWillis is the same in every role.  He has a single character he canplay, although in some movies, he does shave.  I loved DIE HARD and DIEHARD 2 and thought he was terrific in each.  Here he is too much of aretread.  In many of his movies (don't see COLOR OF NIGHT for example),he becomes a parody of an overacting actor.       Samuel L. Jackson (from PULP FICTION among others) does okay witha poor script that kept falling back on racial insults in a poorattempt to prop up weak writing.  Jeremy Irons (DAMAGE, REVERSAL OFFORTUNE, DEAD RINGERS, and most of all BRIDESHEAD REVISITED on TV) isone of the most talented actors living today.  Here he does the most hecan with the character he is given.  He does a good villain.       By half way through this overly long picture, I was gettingexhausted by all of the games Simon was making McClane and Zeus performlike puppets.  It got extremely repetitious and monotonous watching avery bloody and sweaty McClean accomplish the impossible every fiveminutes.  I kept hoping that the make up department would run out ofall of that disgusting blood.  Simon was driving them like raw recruitsin boot camp.  I got as tired as they did, but I was not being paidmillions and millions of dollars to endure this as WIllis and Jacksonwere.  When the credits finally rolled, I was worn out and ready toleave.       DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE runs a debilitating 2:10 thanks toeditor John Wright.  It is correctly rated R for massive amounts ofblood, gore, and destruction.  There was no sex or violence to intrudeon this mayhem.  This is only for older teenagers I think, but I amsure that kids way too young will see it in droves.  I do not recommendthe show, but since there was a fair amount in the first half that Iliked, I award it **. ",Die Hard With a Vengeance,R,1995,2.5
255,"If you've recently returned from a vacation and you saw yourchambermaid on the street (assuming she does not look likelike Jennifer Lopez), would you recognize her?  If you've haddealings with the concierge, you'd presumably pick him out of acrowd on your home-town street, but what about the people whowork in the hotel laundry? Those who bused your table? Probably not.  These are the people who work in thebackground, doing the minimum-wage work that others shun,and if illegal aliens working off the books, often exploited bothsexually  and materially by their employers.  In ""Dirty PrettyThings,"" Stephen Frears who seems to be in Ken Loachterritory in knocking out socially-conscious movies about working class stiffs veers away from such tales as ""Bread andRoses,"" ""Ladybird, Ladybird,"" and ""Carla's Song"" by injecting ahorror motif, keeping the audience as tense as though watchinga Hitchcock classic while at the same time getting his left-leaning viewpoint across nice and easy.     ""Dirty Pretty Things"" is even better than Frears's best knownworks, ""Sammy and Rosie Get Laid"" (about the lives of a couplewith an open sexual relationship thrown into disarry) and ""MyBeautiful Launderette"" (about what happens when two youngfriends take over a beat-up launderette) only partly  from theskill of the lead actors.  After all ""Launderette"" starred RoshanSeth and Daniel Day-Lewis and ""Sammy and Rosie"" featuredShashi Kapur and Claire Bloom.  Without illuminating racerelations or the general economic state of Britain, ""Dirty PrettyThings"" focuses on the way immigrants are treated, particularlythose without papers, and thus resonates throughout theprosperous Western world where Turks do the dirty work inGermany, Algerians in France, and Africans in Great Britain.     In fact, since there's no shot of Big Ben, you'd scarcely knowthat Frears's work takes place in London.  Though the poshhotel looks upscale enough to be in Mayfair, Steve Knight'sscreenplay punches out the seedy behavior that lies under theglitzy surface and the exploitation that exists in the nearbysweatshop where seamstresses are warned moments inadvance of a raid by Immigration, the foreman taking advantageof the vulnerability of the workers.     Chiwetel Ejoifor takes the lead as Okwe, a doctor in his nativeNigeria, who was forced to flee Lagos and take up work as adriver by day and a hotel receptionist after sundown.  He'sinvolved with Turkish asylum-seeker Senay (Audrey Tautou),though the romance is an undercover as the machinations ofsome hotel personnel.  When Okwe discovers a black-marketoperation in living organs is taking place including kidneygrabbing that's the stuff of urban legends he becomes awarethat the hotel manager, Sneaky (Segi Lopez), is busy arrangingforged passports and money in return for human organs.     With a terrific payoff courtesy of scripter Steven Knight (""WhoWants to Be a Millionaire""), Frears takes us into the world of theunderground community, illustrating its camaraderie, its sharedfears, its pressure to do virtually anything asked by theemployers.  The ensemble acting is flawless save for thedifficult role faced by Audrey Tautou who (thank goodness)gives up the irritating smile pasted on her face in ""Amelie"" todeliver her lines in English with a Turkish accent.  The storymoves swiftly, one which presumably could transcend its statusas an independent film, and with the right marketing couldbecome the box-office success it deserves. ",Dirty Pretty Things,R,2003,3
256,"Professional assassins are the usually the most fascinatingcategory of criminals on the silver screen and potentiallythe most rewarding for any serious filmmaker. But in thegenre of comedy another category of criminals - con artists- rules supreme. This is hardly surprising because they areby definition the most charming of all criminals, and takingadvantage of other people's stupidity often corresponds withsaid stupidity being the source of on-screen humour. One ofthe examples could be found in DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, 1988comedy directed by Frank Oz.  The plot is set in Beaumont-sur-Mer, little resort town onFrench Riviera, frequented by rich people from USA and otherparts of the world. This used to be the perfect huntingground for Lawrence Jamieson (played by Michael Caine),sophisticated and suave British con artist specialised inextracting money from rich and gullible women by posing as amysterious exiled prince. Through the years Jamieson amassedenough fortune to afford a mansion, butler (played by IanMcDiarmid) and co-operation of local police inspector(played by Anton Rodgers). His idyllic life suddenly becomesthreatened with the arrival of rival in the form of FreddyBenson (played by Steve Martin), uneducated andunsophisticated American who earns money by telling sobstories about his ill grandmother. Jamieson, convinced thatthis raw routine might bring unwanted attention, doeseverything in his power to drive Freddy out of town, but theAmerican keeps coming back. Finally, two men decide to makea wager - whoever extracts 50,000 US$ from American ""soapqueen"" Janet Colgate (played by Glenne Headley) wins, andthe loser would have to leave town.  Not among the most remarkable films thirteen years ago,DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS looks surprisingly good from today'sperspective. The reason is probably in the humour, which isway above the today's Hollywood standards of comedy embodiedin the films by Farrelly brothers. The script by DaleLauner, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning is very intelligentand the film leaves the impression of belonging to anotherera - 1950s or 1960s (hardly a surprise, since this happensto be the remake of BEDTIME STORY, directed by Ralph Levy in1963). The plot is, on the other hand, weak and serves asnothing more than excuse for the series of scenes in whichtwo principal characters try to outwit each other. Anothersurprise of the film is good direction by Frank Oz of MUPPETSHOW fame; in DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, unlike his previousfilm THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, he abandons special effectsin favour of authentic locations of French Riviera (andfamous Victorine studios in Nice) and allows great actors tocarry the film. Michael Caine and Steve Martin look likethey were born to play the characters; the contrast betweensophisticated European and provincial American is not onlymirrored in screen personalities of Michael Caine and SteveMartin, but also in the different styles of acting. WhileCaine, same as his aristocratic character, keeps stiff upperlip at all times, Steve Martin often goes for the physicalcomedy, although not always with the best results. Thebiggest and the most pleasant surprise, however, comes inthe form of Glenne Headley, the actress who had misfortuneof wasting her talent in many disastrous films in late 1980sand early 1990s. Her talents were not wasted in DIRTY ROTTENSCOUNDRELS - she simply shines in the role of naive andinnocent woman whose charm is going to enchant our immoralprotagonists. Unfortunately, she appears relatively late,and because of that the film is slightly overlong, and thetwist ending is not as unpredictable as the authors wouldlike. DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS is nevertheless very funny andentertaining film that should be recommended as an exampleof something that is rather absent in Hollywood these days -stylish and well-crafted comedy. ",Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,PG,1998,3
257,"The cinematic oeuvre of Baltimore-based cult filmmaker John Watershas always been counted on to deliver a highly off-kilter, often sexually-chargedperspective on any number of topics„serial killing (1994's ""SerialMom""), artists (1998's ""Pecker""), and filmmaking (2000's ""Cecil B.Demented"") being his most recent targets„but ""A Dirty Shame"" goesone step further, nearly matching the explicit depravity of his reigningclassic, 1972's ""Pink Flamingos."" The film is, at once, harmlesslygood-natured and as twistedly perverse as any major picture so farthis decade. Writer-director Waters will do anything, and go as faras he wants to, in his mission to make the viewer simultaneously winceand cackle with laughter. One might feel a little unclean once the89-minute freak show is over, but, for the not-easily-offended, thisis certainly one of the most deliriously ballsy comedies to hit screens in years. Set in the blue-collar Baltimore neighborhood of Harford Road, SylviaStickles (Tracey Ullman) is a no-nonsense, middle-aged drug storeclerk no longer interested in sex with husband Vaughn (Chris Isaak)and disgusted by her ridiculously large-breasted, exhibitionist daughter,Caprice (Selma Blair), known fondly around town by the male populationas Ursula Udders. Things suddenly change, however, when Sylvia isknocked unconscious during a traffic accident, awakening as an insatiablesex addict. She is promptly taken in by Ray-Ray Perkins (Johnny Knoxville),the leader of an underground group of sex fiends who have all sufferedfreak brain damage. As Sylvia, Ray-Ray, and the rest of their clanset out to take over the Harford Road area and screw as many peopleas they can, angry retaliation comes in the form of the town's ""neuters,""headed by Sylvia's fed-up, crotchety mother, Big Ethel (Suzanne Shepherd). The opening half-hour of ""A Dirty Shame"" is comic gold, a literallynon-stop barrage of brilliantly savage sight gags and hilariouslylewd one-liners. The proceeding hour is more uneven, as things gofrom outrageous to downright bizarre and the plotting, which too closelyresembles ""Cecil B. Demented"" in its look at a group of deviant outcasts,becomes decidedly scattered. Even when the material doesn't alwayswork, however, one has to admire John Waters' quirky ambition andno-holds-barred attitude, He is shameless in his juvenile mindset,and his joyful onslaught of immorality wears you into submission.Some of the time„actually, most of the time„you are so in awe at whatyou are seeing and hearing that conventional criticism doesn't really apply. Tracey Ullman (2000's ""Small Time Crooks"") stands alongside Amy Sedaris(of Comedy Central's ""Strangers with Candy"") as one of the most gifted,incendiary female comics working today, and she is insanely good hereas psychosexual heroine Sylvia Stickles. Ullman sees her every linedelivery and every facial expression as a chance to elicit ribaldlaughter from the audience„even her very first line in the film, ""I'mmakin' scrapple!,"" defies description of how funny it is to hear hersay it„and she fearlessly runs with it. She also has a way of makingthe rudest of material seem almost innocent, which is the key to SylviaStickles' innate likability. A conversation Ullman shares with SelmaBlair (2004's ""Hellboy""), courageously uninhibited as daughter Caprice,as they bond over their shared sexual appetite, is surprisingly sweetin the most flagrant form of the word. Although ""A Dirty Shame"" warrants the NC-17 rating it receives, atleast in regard to the MPAA's stuffy standards, it is ironic thatpart of the core audience who would go wild for the movie„15-to-17-year-olds„haveno chance of seeing it in theaters. Save for the liberal, open-minded,and John Waters' fans, most adults will need not apply. If you don'tfind the sight of Tracey Ullman picking up a water bottle with hervagina while dancing to the ""Hokey-Pokey"" at an unsuspecting seniorcitizens home funny, and if the very idea of sex addicts corruptingan entire town in some of the most graphic ways imaginable isn't yourcup of tea, then so be it. A fervent attack of close-vested right-wingers,and, arguably, the entire Republican Party, writer-director John Watersrightfully makes no apologies for what he has made. ""A Dirty Shame""is what it is, and, regardless of whether it could be deemed ""good""or ""bad"" (a case could be made that it is both at the same time),it is consistently, stomach-churningly watchable. ","Dirty Shame, A",NC-17,2004,2.5
258," Three senior members of the Australian Department of Radio Physics, Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill), Ross 'Mitch' Mitchell (Kevin Harrington) and Glenn Latham (Tom Long), and their NASA associate, Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton), have a problem on their hands.  Their 210-foot, 1,000-ton dish -- a hunk of metal set in the middle of nowhere in an Australian sheep paddock near the town of Parkes, Australia -- has lost Apollo 11.  It's 1969, and it's their responsibility to transmit the television signals of the moon walk to the rest of the world.  It's an awesome responsibility for these 4 blokes, but in this heartwarming film, these guys are up for their mission.  The first of their problems is caused by a brief power outage, but in a cute and imaginative illustration of the fundamental difference between mathematics and engineering, these slide rule jockeys figure a way out of their predicament and locate the ""lost"" spacecraft.  This ground level view of space exploration is actually based on a true story.  Rob Sitch, the director and co-writer of the marvelously offbeat Australian comedy THE CASTLE, brings together his writing team from THE CASTLE (Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner and Jane Kennedy), and the surprise is that they are as good with THE DISH's light comedy as they were with THE CASTLE's over-the-top brand of humor.  Although there are plenty of laughs in THE DISH, it is the amazing but simple story of dedication that remains in your memory after you leave the theater.  Making extensive use of archival footage and audio clips, the movie does a masterful job of transporting us back in time.  Graeme Wood's warm cinematography has the saturated colors of a 1960s TV set.  The musical choices are an evocative choice of memorable old pop tunes and moving dramatic pieces.  In short, this is a movie that really knows how to set the mood.  The writers provide rich stories and back stories for a large number of characters.  We get to know everyone from the townsfolk to the Prime Minister.  The best defined is Cliff Buxton, the pipe smoking ""dish master,"" who looks and acts like a revered college professor.  Cliff's wife died a year ago, and he still bears the scars of her death.  The residents of Parkes are a hoot.  They wonder what the astronauts do when they need to do ""number 2.""  Can't hold it for 4 days, they figure.  ""I reckon, they oughta try one of these,"" one guy says, pointing to a local ""delicacy.""  ""Block 'em up for a week.""    Most of the time, the dish is a hotbed of inactivity as the scientists inside wait for the earth to rotate.  (The dish shares prime tracking responsibility with a dish in California, which follows the capsule when it is on California's side of the globe.)  But when disaster strikes, the magic of science comes through as these engineers work through the night with blackboard and chalk as their prime tools.  The wonderment of scientific endeavor hasn't been so well displayed since OCTOBER SKY.  When most people think of space command and control, they think of NASA, in which thousands of scientists toiled away for years.  What is remarkable about this story is that without these four unsung heroes, July 20, 1969 would have lost most of its impact.  Without live pictures, the moonwalk would not have been nearly so dramatic or memorable.    But this is a sweetly humorous, not a somberly serious, movie.  The dish's clueless guard, Rudi Kellerman (Tayler Kane), maintains the world's loosest security, but he tries to do his best.  ""Halt!  Who goes there?"" he demands sternly one dark night when he detects a breach of the compound area.  ""Baaaa,"" the intruder replies.    THE DISH runs a fast 1:40. The film is incorrectly rated PG-13 for brief strong language.  I listened hard and don't remember any profanities.  The film would clearly be acceptable for all ages, but younger children will likely get fidgety. ","Dish, The",PG-13,2001,3.5

You won't get rid of yourshticklach that way and they may not even be around any longerfor you to get some comeuppance with them.  In Callie Khouri'smovie ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" adapted fromtwo novels of Rebecca Wells, Sidda (Sandra Bullock), asuccessful playwright, gave an interview to Time magazine inwhich she accused her mother, Vivi (Ellen Burstyn)  of variousimproprieties in upbringing.  When Vivi read the article, sheemotionally disowned the lass, even sending Sidda some familypictures with Sidda's photos cut out.     ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" has a stunning castof performers who repeated get roles despite (or, in factbecause of) their age, namely Ellen Burstyn as the once drug-and alcohol-addicted mom, James Garner as the passive andsaintly dad, Shirley Knight and Maggie Smith as childhoodfriends of Vivi who in one pre-pubescent rite around a campfirepledged a blood-defined sisterhood with one another, callingthemselves the Ya-Ya's.  Determined to stick together throughlife, the now-elderly women set out to honor their pledge, bygetting Sidda and Vivi to make up and be friends.     The plot is a dandy one to work with and because theemphasis is almost wholly on the women (men are there mostlyas decoration, particularly the handsome Angus MacFadyen asSidda's fianc‰ Connor), ""Ya-Ya"" has been called a chick-flick. However the story goes hither and thither from childhoodexperiences (most powerfully a scene in which the drug-crazedVivi takes a strap to Sidda for no rational purpose whatever) tothe women as adults that a genuine connective thread is lost. What's more there is so little similarity between the younger Viviplayed by the beautiful Ashley Judd and the older gal as EllenBurstyn that one can't be blamed for confusing the women, whoat times seem interchangeable.  As for the notion of ""chick-flicks,"" I don't see the point in labeling or separating stories bygender genres, nor could I ever understand the practice ofteachers in junior high school to assign summer reading as twolists: one for boys, the other for girls.  Don't we men want toknow how the other half lives? What they think?  What turnsthem on?     Though Roger Ebert holds that there isn't a believablemoment in the film, perhaps the Chicago-based reviewer (likeme) has no experience with Southern belles who despite thehomogenization of America still act in ways that may beincomprehensible to us northerners.  Believability is not theproblem.  The women are a pleasure to watch.  But a morestraightforward narrative would have been helpful. ",Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,PG-13,2002,2
260,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is a stupid comedy made smart bydebuting writer-dir ector Rawson Marshall Thurber's wit-filled, good-naturedhold on the material. The film, which is a cross between David Zucker'sunderapprectiated 1998 gem, ""BASEketball,"" and 1988's ""Major League,""takes practically every convention of the sports genre possible andmakes it feel fresh with a zippy pace, likable actors clearly havinga blast, and often on-target comic timing. There's nothing deep ormeaningful about any of it, but then, there isn't supposed to be.For fans of strictly low-brow humor, ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story""will come as a godsend. Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is the nice-guy owner of a lowly localgym called Average Joe's that is constantly being upstaged by GloboGym, the high-tech, ultra-snooty corporate fitness club across thestreet. When he is told by kindly lawyer Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor)that he has thirty days to come up with the $50,000 needed to gethimself out of debt, or risk losing the place to make way for a GloboGym parking garage, Peter is ready to throw in the towel. With thehelp of his few loyal misfit members, however, including teenage chearleader-wannabeJustin (Justin Long), the aptly-named Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk),and the terminally cheerful Gordon (Stephen Root), they formulatean idea. If Peter and his friends can make it to Las Vegas to competein a national dodgeball tournament and win, the grand prize is $50,000.What they don't expect is that they will have to play against WhiteGoodman (Ben Stiller), the health-and-self-obsessed owner of GloboGym, and his minions. Along the way, Kate, who has eight years ofsoftball training under her belt, begins to sympathize with Peter'scause and joins their team. Above all else, ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is a genuine crowd-pleaser(given one isn't easily offended), more than willing to be downrightsophomoric in the name of garnering big laughs. Although there area fair share of comedic misses, and at least ten too many ball-in-the-groin-stylejokes, writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber has filled his screenplaywith enough clever one-liners, downright outrageous asides, and off-the-wallsurprise cameo appearances that it is easy to wade through the rough patches. Although it would be criminal to spoil the picture's funniest moments,look out for a 1950's educational video on dodgeball that Justin nabsfrom his P.E. class, which skewers the ridiculousness of such shortfilms to hilarious perfection; the elderly, wheelchair-bound PatchesO'Houlihan (Rip Torn), once a dodgeball champion who teaches the ""sport""to Peter and the gang by throwing wrenches at them and making themdodge traffic on a busy city street; and a locker room mix-up at theLas Vegas championships that forces the Average Joe's to wear somehighly compromising uniforms. Meanwhile, Cotton McKnight (Gary Cole)and sidekick Pepper Brooks (Jason Bateman) take the roles of two ofthe most off-color, dim-witted commentat ors to ever show up in asports comedy. And don't even thinking about leaving before the endcredits have rolled; the coda is one of the most perverse and ingeniouslyfunny in recent memory. Vince Vaughn is typecast so frequently as the heavy (i.e. 2004's ""Starsky& Hutch,"" 2001's ""Domestic Disturbance"") that it is sometimes difficultto remember just how charming he can be as the lead protagonist. Here,as the lovable Peter La Fleur, whose neglect in charging membershipfees to his gym customers has left him broke, Vaughn is at the topof his game. Likewise, Ben Stiller is so often the romantic lead (i.e.2004's ""Along Came Polly,"" 2003's ""Duplex,"" 2000's ""Meet the Parents"") that it is a veritable treat to see him go deliciously over-the-topas the daffily psychotic White Goodman. Take his character of Zoolander,who was in love with himself, and take out all of his attributes,and you'll have a good idea of how Stiller plays the part. The rest of the cast performs their duties with engaging vigor, includingChristine Taylor (2001's ""Zoolander"") as the unicorn-obsessed KateVeatch; a standout Rip Torn (2002's ""Freddy Got Fingered"") as theno-nonsense Patches O'Houlihan; Justin Long (2001's ""Jeepers Creepers"")as teenage ""queer-bait"" Justin; and Stephen Root, as Gordon, in themost memorable role he's had since 1999's incendiary ""Office Space."" As seems to usua lly be the case with comedies, ""Dodgeball: A TrueUnderdog Story"" hits some potholes as it nears its finish. A third-actconflict that arises, although holding a purpose in the long run,halts up the laughs for a little too long. Luckily, it comes backfor a rousing final few scenes, including an unexpected discoveryabout Kate that is admittedly quite brave for this kind of lighter-than-airentertainment. For viewers already growing weary of this summer'sspecial effects extravaganzas and who just want to laugh for 90 minuteswithout having to think too much, the no-holds-barred ""Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story"" will happily do the trick.",Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,PG-13,2004,2.5
261,"Nancy Savoca's ""Dogfight"" is a virtually unknown gem, and is one of the sweetest, most touching romances of the decade. It was barely released in 1991 by Warner Brothers, who must not have had much faith in such a truthful motion picture, and it shows (since then, they have widely released such gems as 1997's ""Batman and Robin,"" and this year alone, have come out with the likes of ""Major League III,"" and ""The Avengers""). ""Dogfight,"" however, is an important film that deserves to be seen, and includes two of the best performances of the 90's.  Set in 1963, primarily during one fateful night, four young Marines stop in a small town for their last night stateside, not knowing the horrors that await them in Vietnam. Together, they decide to participate in the game, ""Dogfight,"" which requires each of them to find the ugliest woman they can find, take her to a party, and then have them judged on the the most unattractive one. The film focuses mostly on Birdlace (River Phoenix, in one of his last movies), who, while looking for a victim, stumbles into a coffee shop and meets Rose (Lili Taylor), an introverted young woman who hides behind frumpy clothes and her love of folk music. They start to talk, and Birdlace asks her to come to the party, and she agrees to it, not believing that someone would actually be interested in her. Birdlace realizes Rose isn't actually ""ugly,"" but it's the best he can do.   That is only the beginning of ""Dogfight,"" a quiet, flawlessly made film, in which not much more should be said, except to say that Birdlace begins to actually like Rose, and it develops into much more of a complex story than it originally seems.  Although the basic plotline may sound cruel and mean-spirited, and it is, at the center of the story is a wonderful, sweet, poignantly written, love story. To get a feel for the type of picture it is, the movie is similar in structure to 1995's ""Before Sunrise,"" which was about two twentysomethings who meet on a train and decide to spend the day together in Venice before going their separate ways. The differences, however, is that this film is set during the Vietnam War and there are much more serious overtones.   If there is one element of ""Dogfight"" that I could single out as being brilliant in every sense of the word, it is Lili Taylor, who, in one role after the other, gives a three-dimensional, flesh-and-blood performance, and this is her best role to date. Her character is so likable that when bad things happen to her, it is heartbreaking and feels unfair. One of the best scenes occurs early on, after she has been humiliated at the Dogfight, and goes home, turns on her folk record in her bedroom, and simply sits down to listen to it. Sure, she has just been embarrassed, but at least she has her music. Most movies wouldn't have the integrity to include such a small, delicate scene, but it is an important moment.  The last ten minutes of ""Dogfight"" are what makes the movie really special, however, particularly the startlingly powerful last scene, in which nothing is said or explained, but then, nothing needs to be.  ",Dogfight,R,1991,4
262,"      You've had a hard day, and the circuits in your brain have gone onoverload.  You know you should see the latest Swedish film since it isfull of angst and deep hidden meanings, but you got so depressed afterthe last message movie you saw that you couldn't sleep afterwards.  Youare too busy to see, much less smell the daisies.  Romance?  Well,forget it.  You figure romance these days only comes in cheap novelsnext to the tabloids at the supermarket.       Does any of this ring true for you?  Then, I have a light hearted,fairy tale of a romance for you.  It is called DON JUAN DEMARCO.  Thereis not much in it, but what there is is a delight and will reaffirmyour belief in life and especially in romance.       DON JUAN DEMARCO asks the question what is reality and why do youcare.  Is reality a bunch of messy old facts or can you adopt awonderful fantasy and make it your reality through force of will?  Is afirmly and completely believed fantasy more valid than mere facts?       DON JUAN DEMARCO (Johnny Depp) is the world's greatest lover.  Bythe age of 21, he has made love to over 1,500 women, but he says he hasseduced none of them.  He always wears a large hat, a mask, and clothesthat his Grandmother says makes him look like Zorro.  His name isItalian, he speaks with a Castilian accent, he claims to have come fromMexico, and he is lives in the US.       Nobody can sweet talk women like he can.  His handholding scene isthe most erotic I have ever seen excepting only for the one in THE AGEOF INNOCENCE.  When his one true love asks him on the beach on theIsland of Eros how many lovers he has had before her, he feels he musttell her the truth.  He says, ""1502 including you"".  After she thenleaves him forever, he comments ""I think she was expecting a lessornumber"".       After she ditches him, he decides his life is not worth livingsince he can only love her, and he decides to commit suicide.  On theway to kill himself, he drops by the Hotel Seville and first makes loveto just one more stranger.  He is saved from his death by a localpsychologist, Dr. Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando).  Dr. Mickler agreesto treat him without medication if Don Juan will tell the doctor hisstory.       As the mesmerizing story unfolds, Dr. Mickler becomes a believer.Moreover, it begins to work a spell on him and starts to rekindle hislove life with his wife of thirty years (Faye Dunaway).  Don Juan's lifeis fascinating.  He was sexual precocious from a small baby.  Girlslined up to pay to kiss him when he was an adolescent.  By the time, hereached sixteen, well, let's just say that many adventures awaited him.       There is a lot to recommend this delightful bit of fluff, but letme get the bad news out of the way first.  I am sorry to report thatthe great Marlon Brando has been kidnapped!  In his place, they have amuch larger, quite mediocre, and very boring actor.  Although he doeslook like Brando, he is clearly someone else.  The great Brando ownedevery scene he play in.  Even when he overacted, he always commandedattention.  This clown makes you look at your watch every time thecamera is on him.  Faye Dunaway tries to mimic his stoicism and comesclose.  Their non-performances were able to knock my rating down a pegor two.       There is a lot wonderful about DON JUAN DEMARCO, but at the top isthe marvelous performance by Johnny Depp.  The words flow from his lipslike butter.  His screen presence was completely convincing.  There wasno doubt in my mind that he was DON JUAN DEMARCO.       The script by Jeremy Leven is worthy of the Brothers Grimm.  Thecinematography by Ralf D. Bode and the set decoration of Mexico isevocative of a romantic era of long ago.  It has the feel of LIKE WATERFOR CHOCOLATE.  The natural and richly colorful sets and the warm glowof the filming makes happiness flow through all of your veins.  Thecostumes by Kirsten Everberg are full of romance and love.  Finally,this was the first film in a while that has a musical score that Ithought really adds to the ambiance.       The director, Jeremy Leven, understood the mood he wanted tocreate and did it quite well.  Why he had to cast Brando and Dunaway, Iwill never fully understand.  Yes, I guess, he must have figured thatthey would add to the box office take, but when he saw the dailies, whydidn't he change his mind and get some other actors?  Oh well, ...       DON JUAN DEMARCO runs a quick 1:32.  It is correctly rate PG-13for two very brief nude scenes, a bloody and deadly sword fight, and asubtle love making scene with all of their clothes on.  Any kid olderthan 12 who is interested in romance would like it.  I recommend it toyou, and I award it ** 1/2.  As I said earlier, it had the potentialfor a much higher rating. ",Don Juan DeMarco,PG-13,1995,2.5
263,"In DON'T SAY A WORD, Michael Douglas, as psychiatrist Dr. Nathan Conrad, hasjust hours to meet the kidnappers' demands or they'll kill hiseight-year-old daughter, Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak).  They don't wantmoney.  They need Dr. Conrad, an expert on dealing with severely troubledteens, to get his new patient, Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), toreveal a six-digit number that only she knows.  Is he up to the pressure?Can he pull it off?  Of course.  He's Michael Douglas.  And being MichaelDouglas he'll have you empathizing with his pain. Directed by Gary Fleder, this entertaining thriller delivers the goods.Sure, it follows a fairly standard formula, but you won't mind.  There arejust enough twists to keep you guessing, and the acting is solid from FamkeJanssen, as Jessie's temporarily incapacitated mother, to Sean Bean, as theomnipresent leader of the kidnappers.  Fleder, as he did in KISS THE GIRLS,keeps you on your toes and ready to be frightened, even if things rarely dogo ""Boo!""  It is anticipation that causes chills not actions. Although it is a satisfying film, it's not a flawless one.  The script byPatrick Smith Kelly and Anthony Peckham, based on Andrew Klavan's novel, hassome easily fixed problems and troubling logical holes.  Det. Sandra Cassidy(Jennifer Esposito), for example, foolishly ventures alone into a dark anddangerous situation without first requesting backup.  The kidnappers, whosesole goal is to get the numbers, have key information that will help Dr.Conrad find them, yet refuse to tell him.  And in the missed opportunitycategory, why do the writers take the time to setup an elaborate mysteryaround Elisabeth's mental condition and then immediately solve it?  What'sthe rush? Among the film's most satisfying twists is the story's final resolution.  Inthis, the writers don't disappoint. DON'T SAY A WORD runs 1:40.  It is rated R for ""violence, including somegruesome images, and language"" and would be acceptable for teenagers.",Don't Say a Word,R,2001,2.5
264,"      Does the world need another mob movie?  Do we still have the bloodlust for Mafia minutia?  Are there any actors left who can carry on theGodfather legacy?       DONNIE BRASCO avoids answering these questions and contents itselfwith being a true story.  Just the facts ma'am.  The mob in this movieis neither glamorous nor particularly horrifying - just a bunch ofworking-class stiffs out to make a living.  Some of their anxieties arecommon ones we can identify with such as being passed over forpromotion (being ""upped"") or working hard for the company and not beingrecognized.  Others, such as being ""whacked,"" certainly exceed the fearof being downsized.  At least if you lose your job, in most firms deathis not part of the severance package.       Director Mike Newell, whose recent work has been with suchwonderful, lighthearted comedies as FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, sets afactual tone from the beginning.  The script by Academy Award nominatedwriter Paul Attanasio (QUIZ SHOW) lacks the gimmicks and sensationalismof typical Mafia films.  (The script is based on the book ""DonnieBrasco: Undercover Life in the Mafia"" by Joseph Pistone and RichardWoodley.)  The gangsters in this film are much more human andaccessible characters.  They perform terrible deeds certainly, but noneare awarded the mythical and heroic status most such pictures bestow onhoodlums.       Johnny Depp, perhaps the best young actor in the business, giveshis usual outstanding performance as undercover agent Joe Pistone, whowas known to the mob as Donnie Brasco.  In 1978, after two years ofundercover work, Joe breaks into the mob through his connection towiseguy Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino).  Just as actors get into characterfor a part and have trouble breaking out, so does Joe.  Joe istransformed body and soul into a wiseguy wannabe.  The tight cultureand family of the Mafia draw him in so that he becomes increasingestranged from the FBI and from his wife, Maggie (Anne Heche), and histhree lovely daughters.  It's difficult keeping the family together ifyou can only see them sporadically.  All of this notwithstanding,Pistone was one of the most important FBI plants ever.  Hundreds ofpeople were convicted because of his courage and tenacity.       Pacino's Lefty looks at first like a consummate professionalcrook.  He is the cock of the walk.  With Orwellian logic, he explainsto Donnie that, ""A wiseguy is always right - even when he is wrong.""       With the power of a made man, he makes Donnie ""connected,"" whichmeans that Lefty is his mentor and no one will dare touch Donnie.  IfDonnie plays his cards right, someday he too could join the innercircle and become a wiseguy.  (As you watch their antics, you realizethat the moniker wiseguy has such great irony.  Wise they are not.Their success comes solely from their position and the fear theyinduce.  Lefty has trouble even breaking into a parking meter to stealthe change.)       Lefty turns out to be a bitter second string player, who, althoughhe constantly boasts of 26 kills, secretly fears he will be whacked byone of the more successful wiseguys.  ""Thirty years I'm busting myhump,"" complains Lefty.  ""What have I got?""  He derives more pleasurein cooking than trying to figure out the next job to pull.  ""Who am I?""he complains.  ""Who am I?  I'm a spoke on a wheel.""  Together Pacinoand Depp turn in two fascinating performances with believable machochemistry between the two of them.  Lefty becomes Donnie's surrogatefather, buddy, and constant companion.       The richly textured story focuses on the day-to-day life andschemes of the Mafia.  The story concentrates on relationships andpolitical intrigues rather than violence.       A well developed subplot deals with the difficulties of Donnie'shome life and tells this part of the story with a realism I have notseen before.  You empathize with the wife and kids, and yet Depptransfers the feeling of being trapped so that you can understand bothsides.  Ultimately, Donnie recognizes and resents his transformations.""I'm not becoming like them,"" he confesses to Maggie.  ""I am them.""       A poignant, but funny vignette has Joe and Maggie seekingcounseling to avoid divorce.  Therapists lack training on dealing withthe stress caused by being an undercover cop.  Their inept therapistgives them lectures full of jargon that are so far off base that theyborder on parody.       The script is highly polished.  In one beautifully written sceneDonnie explains to his FBI comrades the nuances of the five subtletydifferent pronunciations of ""Forget about it.""       Director Mike Newell's skill can be seen throughout.  He does notexcuse the horrors of Lefty's profession, but he has a deft sense ofwhen to back off.  This can be seen in potentially the most horrificact of violence in the picture.  Newell shows just enough so that theactions are clear, but he does not let his cameras linger.  Theresulting image possesses a humorously macabre feeling.       Joe couldn't leave his work at the office like most of us.  Thisunglamorized view of his travails as an undercover agent ismesmerizing.  If you think you have seen it all when it comes to themob, think again.  Even if you could care less about organized crime,DONNIE BRASCO is as interesting an exploration of the human spirit andfailings as it is a story about crime and moral turpitude.       DONNIE BRASCO runs 2:06.  It is rated R for violence, profanity,and sexuality.  It would be fine for most teenagers.  I highlyrecommend the film to you and give it *** 1/2. ",Donnie Brasco,R,1997,3
265,"""The Door in the Floor"" is a psychological drama about the unravelingof a marriage following the deaths of a couple's two teenage sons.It is also a coming-of-age story about a teenage boy who walks intotheir lives and unwittingly changes both of them, for better or worse.While these interconnecting storylines present considerable potential,writer-director Tod Williams (1999's ""The Adventures of SebastianCole"") doesn't know the first thing about satisfactorily developingcharacters and relationships. Worse yet, Williams is clueless whenit comes to capturing the truths of human nature, and presenting themso that the characters' actions are both logical and accessible toviewers. And amidst all of the bleak seriousness are scenes of over-the-topfarcical comedy, each one of them as out of place as a pig in a chicken coop. When 16-year-old aspiring writer Eddie O'Hare (Jon Foster) comes tostay with and work for children's author Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) forthe summer, he is unprepared for what he finds. Ted and wife Marion(Kim Basinger) have recently separated, alternating their time betweentheir luxurious Hampton home and an apartment in town as they half-heartedlycare for their perpetually curious 4-year-old daughter, Ruth (ElleFanning). On the side, Ted paints nude drawings of various women,including the middle-aged Evelyn Vaughn (Mimi Rogers), using Eddieas his chauffeur to get around. Meanwhile, Marion catches Eddie masturbatingone day to her bra and panties, finds herself attracted to the ideaof being desired again, and promptly starts a none-too-secret affairwith the virginal teen. There is even more trouble with the Cole'sthan meets the eye, however, stemming from the unexpected deaths oftheir two sons several years before, and Eddie is about to get caught in the middle. Based on the first-third of John Irving's sprawling novel, ""A Widowfor One Year,"" ""The Door in the Floor"" aspires to accomplish manythings at once, weaving a tapestry about the deterioration of a coupleand the ways in which loss and regret are dealt with, but it doesnone of it well. The film's biggest problem is that the charactershaven't been fully thought out or conceived, and the choices theymake seem senseless and, therefore, rather spineless. Ted, a functioningalcoholic, is thoroughly unpleasant to just about everyone but Ruth,putting down those around him in subtle ways that make his condescensionall the more hurtful, and taking advantage of Eddie for unclear reasons.Marion is more or less dead inside until Eddie enters her life; sodepressed is she that one almost expects her to commit suicide atany minute. She is outwardly nicer than Ted, but so thoroughly uninterestedin being a parent to Ruth that she would rather not be in her lifeat all. A particular choice she makes in the final act involving thefamily pictures is unforgivable, the final straw of a character thatmight have otherwise had some sympathetic shadings. And as for teenageEddie, the story is primarily told through his eyes, but said eyesare difficult to read. Eddie is a hopelessly static creation, andwhatever he learns by film's end is never revealed to the viewer. Writer-director Tod Williams' study on loss and the plight of histhree central characters aren't quite as emphatic as he wants themto be because he fails to make them into characters even remotelydeserving of being cared about. Ted and Marion share only a handfulof scenes together, not enough to get a sense of how they truly feelabout each other or how their marriage might have been in the past.As for the matter of losing one's children, only sparse hints aregiven about how life was for Ted, Marion, and their sons before tragedyhit, and while there are effective individual moments of grief thatfeel real, the rest is misguided and opts not to deal with it at all.For a similar motion picture, 2002's ""Moonlight Mile"" is uncountablysuperior and more accurate. That lovely film, for one, knew how toelicit natural humor and human emotions out of dark subject matter.In comparison, ""The Door in the Floor"" is disastrous in its embarrassingattempts at screwball comedy; none of it works, none of it is necessary,and the unfunny shtick clangs loudly in between sequences that aresupposed to be dramatic and resonant. The cast is a uniformly excellent one, but the actors find varyingdegrees of success. Jeff Bridges (2003's ""Seabiscuit"") is connivingin a slyly understated way as Ted Cole. Concentrating on his facialexpressions throughout and nothing else, the viewer would think Tedis a nice guy; listening to the words he speaks and the way he carrieshimself around others, his true colors show. As the devastated, butstill irresponsible, Marion, Kim Basinger (2002's ""8 Mile"") deliversthe film's strongest turn. Until the wrongheaded, confusing actionshe takes at the end, Basinger poignantly burrows herself into thehelpless state of a woman who believes she has lost everything thatmatters, and doesn't want what she has left (namely, her husband anddaughter). Disappointingly, the payoff of her character is inadequate.As the ambitious, quiet Eddie, Jon Foster (2001's ""Life as a House"")holds up his end against veterans Bridges and Basinger, but strugglesto find depth in a flat character that, despite having the most screentime, changes the least of anyone. In smaller parts, young Elle Fanning(2003's ""Daddy Day Care"") has some work to do before she matches herborderline-genius actress sister, Dakota, but is pretty sharp, allthe same, as daughter Ruth; Bijou Phillips (2000's ""Almost Famous"")is memorably honest in her fleeting moments as Ruth's unsuspectingnanny; and Mimi Rogers (2003's ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry MetLloyd"") courageously bar es all for no reason in the hateful, thanklessrole of one of Ted's painting subjects. There are good scenes in ""The Door in the Floor"" that take their timeand unfold to cogent effect, but that is where its successes are cutshort. The music score by Terry Stacey (1999's ""Trick"") is plainlyintrusive, hammering home the emotion of each moment to the pointwhere it takes you out of the story . The film is aimless and unknowledgeable,so stubborn not to wrap anything up that it could end at any timein the last fifteen minutes and would be no more worse off. And thatis when the real ending arrives. The final shot, meant to be an ironicsurprise, is frustratingly confounding and too cute by a half . Ifit is supposed to carry extra purpose or symbolism, that meaning islost in Tod Williams' murky filmmaking. ""The Door in the Floor"" isunfocused beyond repair. ","Door In The Floor, The",R,2004,3
266,"Writer/director George Gallo's buddy movie, DOUBLE TAKE, stars Orlando Jones(THE REPLACEMENTS) as sophisticated stockbroker Daryl Chase and EddieGriffin (DEUCE BIGALOW: MALE GIGOLO) as foul-mouthed street hustler FreddyTiffany.  The confusing and awkward script is loosely based on the 1957movie ACROSS THE BRIDGE with Rod Steiger.   DOUBLE TAKE is a comedy in which half of the audience's laughs at ourscreening came from Freddy's propensity to mock his little, white, fluffydog by calling her ""bitch.""  Personally, I didn't find any of the filmfunny, although I did smile when Freddy tried to drive a car across the RioGrande.  Whoops, too deep.    It all starts when Daryl befriends Freddy, who is falsely accused of acrime.  Or is he?  The movie relies on the old routine of things frequentlynot being what they seem.  Well, before you know it, Daryl is suspected of adouble murder and is heading for Mexico, where the CIA will protect him.   Along the way, Daryl and Freddy swap identities.  Daryl, who graduated fromHarvard, has to learn the ways of the street from Freddy, who graduated from""HKU (Hard Knock University).""  In one embarrassing scene, Daryl shows offhis impersonation skills by being loud and obnoxious to a black Amtrakwaiter, while demanding Schlitz Malt Liquor with his dinner. The ridiculousness of the script is perhaps best shown in Daryl's actions onthe train.   While the train is moving, he demands that they install a2-line phone, Internet access and a Fax machine in his compartment.  Thisjust doesn't make any sense whether you take his request to be a seriousone, as it appears to be, or as a joke.  In either case, it isn't funny, andit doesn't make any sense in the context of the story. The entire movie plays like a  reject for a convoluted Saturday Night Liveskit.  And if you ignore the comedic parts and evaluate the movie as a copdrama -- after all, lots of people die -- it has even less to offer.  Thismovie isn't even worth a first take, much less a double take. DOUBLE TAKE runs 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and language andwould be acceptable for kids around 11 and up. My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the film was funny and gave it ***.

267,"Van Damme.  Rodman.  Rourke.  Not the recipe for disaster it appearsto be, thanks to Hong Kong action maestro Tsui Hark (Once Upon a Time inChina), whose brisk, stylish, and inventive direction keeps Double Teammoving fairly smoothly over some turbulent patches--but not smoothly enough. One such turbulent patch is the preposterous plot.  Jean-Claude VanDamme plays Jack Quinn, a CIA operative who, after inadvertently causing thedeath of the son of terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), is sentenced to atop-secret penal colony/think tank for dangerous agents.  After a daringescape, Quinn hooks up with flamboyant arms dealer Yaz (Dennis Rodman) to goafter Stavros. The star of Double Team is not Van Damme nor Rodman but the action,and Tsui, working with a number of HK luminaries such as Samo Hung, stagesome wild and exciting set pieces.  One early sequence that begins in anamusement park and ends in a hospital is more exciting and entertaining thanthe endings of Van Damme's last four films combined (make that the_entirety_ of those four films).  Tsui reaches a delirious high with a manichotel room fight with a Chinese assassin (Xi Xi Xiong, a vet of Tsui's OnceUpon a Time series) who holds a knife with his toes, a scene that duplicatesthe outrageous exuberance of the best HK productions. But, as it stands, the great scenes are just that, good parts of amediocre whole; the talent of the director is not quite enough to make upfor the minimal ability exhibited by some of the other people working on theproduction.  The line of the plot cooked up by Don Jakoby and Paul Mones isquite hokey, to say the least, and certain plot devices stretch credibility,even for an action film, most notably how the heroes survive the finale(oops, did I ruin it for some people?).  Without giving the specifics away,it makes me wonder just how much a certain company paid for such ablatant--and, admittedly, creative--product placement.  Even though VanDamme thankfully has little dialogue to work with, when he does speak, he isas wooden as ever.  The big question here is whether or not hoopster Rodmancan act, and after seeing the film, I'm not completely sure.  He plays avariation of his own outrageous personality, which, naturally, he does wellenough; time will tell if he can actually play a character.  The problemwith Rodman, however, is that he sticks out like a sore thumb throughout thepicture; his involvement is obvious stunt casting--a bit too much so.  Nothelping matters at all are the numerous throwaway basketball referencesserved up by the scripters; they just serve to take the audience out of themovie even more. Double Team is certainly one of Van Damme's best, but in light ofhis less-than-sterling body of work, that isn't saying a whole lot.",Double Team,R,1997,2.5
268,"DOWN WITH LOVE, directed by BRING IT ON's Peyton Reed, is such a scrumptiouspiece of cinematic fluff that you might be tempted to say that it's sinfullydelicious.  But, since it is both spoof of and homage to the innocent DorisDay and Rock Hudson comedies, the movie is anything but sinful.  About asracy as it ever gets is some side-splitting sexual innuendo and a verymodest amount of closed-mouth kissing. This wonderfully upbeat and charmingly sweet comedy will have you worryingin less than a quarter of an hour.  Even though you've had a great time upuntil then, you will undoubtedly begin to think that this throwback piecewill not be able to move beyond its hilarious appearance and wackilyold-fashioned dialog.  It looks to be a one-joke movie that could becometiresome.  The script by Eve Ahlert and Dennis Drake, who also wrote theupcoming LEGALLY BLONDE 2, manages to avoid the trap of sameness and explodeinto new comedic realms.  By the end of the story, you will love and careabout its characters, no matter how one-dimensional they might appear. After proudly proclaiming in type that it is a ""CinemaScope Picture,"" themovie quickly orients us: ""The place -- New York City.  The time -- now,1962.""  Out of a taxi steps Ren‰e Zellweger in a heavy, pink suit and a bigwhite hat.  Hats feature prominently in the costume design, which deservesserious Oscar consideration, as do the set decorations.  The movie featurespastels aplenty.  Zellweger plays Barbara Novak, who is in town to meet hereditor, Vikki Hiller (Sarah Paulson).  Barbara is the author of a shockingnew book called ""Down with Love.""  The male suits in the publisher'sboardroom don't know what to make of Barbara since her book preaches thejoys of meaningless sex rather than love.  As she explains, her bookencourages ""women to enjoy sex as men do, ƒ la carte."" Barbara's nemesis is a playboy named Catcher Block (Ewan McGregor).Something of a Hugh Hefner type, he's described as a ""Lady's man, man's manand man about town.""  He's so suave that he attracts women in droves.Zellweger, with her vulnerable confidence, and McGregor, with his bigplastic smile, are both great, but the movie's scene stealer is David HydePierce, who plays Peter MacMannus.  Peter is the owner of the male magazinewhere Catcher is the main writer.  Peter is the anti-Catcher, lacking all ofthe dating skills that Catcher makes appear trivially easy.  I hope theAcademy members remember Pierce's performance when they think aboutsupporting actor nominations. Describing Barbara with disdain as, ""a man-hating spinster, a New Englandlibrarian,"" Catcher initially wants nothing to do with her.  But thingschange, and Catcher, using an alias, pursues Barbara with abandon so that hecan expose her hypocrisy with another of his brilliant strokes ofinvestigative reporting.  Along the way, the story keeps twisting andturning.  Towards the end, in a long monologue that is shown withoutcutaways, Barbara tries to explain the whole convoluted tale.  If you'veseen THE MATRIX RELOADED, you'll immediately see the parallels with thisspeech and that of the Architect in that film, even if the two movies couldnot be more different.  They are similar, however, in two other ways.  Theyopen on the same weekend, and both are great.  DOWN WITH LOVE runs 1:40.

269,"In DOWN TO EARTH, Chris Rock plays a struggling standup comic, Lance Barton,whose jokes -- ""I know this gal so ugly she had to wear makeup on the radio""-- have been dying.  As he tries to get ready for his life's dream, a slotat the amateur night in the last show at the famous Apollo theater, he endsup even deader than his material.  Not one to let a technicality like aheavenly address get in his way, he negotiates with the heavenly powers(Chazz Palminteri and Eugene Levy) to insert him into another earthly bodyso he can play his big gig.  For the record, the hereafter looks like a bigblue nightclub. If this plot sounds familiar, it should.  DOWN TO EARTH is a remake of the1978 film HEAVEN CAN WAIT, starring Warren Beatty.  That film, confusingly,was itself a remake, not of the 1943 film HEAVEN CAN WAIT, but of the 1941picture HERE COMES MR. JORDAN.  Now that we've gotten that straightened out,we can proceed. Young, black, slender and poor Lance ends up in the body of CharlesWellington, a pudgy, white billionaire who is supposed to be 53 but looks adecade older.  Once in his new skins, Lance finds that he sees himself, buteveryone else still sees Charles's body.  The audience sees Lance, exceptfor a few scenes when Charles is rapping or joking with black humor, asblacks stare at him in disbelief and dismay.  At those times, the audiencesees this old white guy disconcertingly trying to act black. Lance transforms Charles from vicious capitalist into kind philanthropist.It isn't quite as magnanimous as it sounds, since Lance starts his giving asa way to impress Suntee (Regina King), a community activist who opposesCharles's plans for Brooklyn Community Hospital.  Charles, the 15th richestman in the world, wants his hospital to boost profits by turning away peoplewithout insurance.  In a dazzling performance for the cameras at thehospital's board meeting, Lance, as Charles, declares, ""Shot in the head,you get a bed.""  No one notices that Charles's lingo suddenly soundsdownscale.  ""Drive home safely, tip your waitresses,"" he tells his boardwhen he leaves. ""I gotst to go."" It's a good natured story, and Rock radiates a sweet likeablenessthroughout.  But, the bottom line is that the movie is basically one longChris Rock comedy routine.

270," Doctor Dolittle should have become a proctologist. Then he'd have been better prepared for the unrelenting onslaught of scatological humor in this crappy comedy. There's nothing wrong with a gross-out joke and ""Doctor Dolittle"" has quite a few funny ones, but the film's unrelenting barrage of butt, rectal and poop humor quickly becomes tiresome, and eventually flat-out annoying. Is this really the best these guys could do with the concept?  Related to Hugh Lofting's children stories and the 1967 Rex Harrison film in name only, this ""Doctor Dolittle"" begins with a pup (Ellen Degeneres) explaining to young John Dolittle that dogs sniff each others rears as a way of saying hello. When the boy emulates the behavior and takes a whiff of the new minister's ass, it's off to the pound for Ellen, while John's father (Ozzie Davis) calls in an exorcist to rid the boy of his ability to talk to the animals.  Cut to the present, where the adult John (Eddie Murphy) is a successful doctor so caught up in his work that he neglects his family. Although his partners are excited that their thriving practice is about to be snapped up by an HMO, John has lost his enthusiasm for practicing medicine. Things change when he whacks his head in an auto mishap and his gift returns. To his amazement, John hears the dog he struck call him ""bonehead.""   Of course, John and Lucky (Norm Macdonald), the recovering mutt, become pals. Soon after, the doc treats a wounded owl and word spreads through the animal kingdom about the doctor who can talk with the animals. John adjusts to the situation and finds his love of healing renewed, although his co-workers and family fear he's lost his mind.   That's certainly a sturdy enough framework for a comedy, had the writers stretched their imaginations a bit. If you take a couple minutes right now, I guarantee you'll come up with at least a dozen gags more inventive than those that appear in this film. After viewing ""Doctor Dolittle,"" it's easy to imagine the producers strapping writers Nat Mauldin and Larry Levin in chairs facing a wall covered with photos of various animals' posteriors and saying ""Create!"" From pigeon poop gags to a long scene involving the retrieval of a thermometer from Lucky's rectum, it's obvious that Mauldin and Levin spent considerable time sniffing butts in preparation for their work.  Despite the repetitive theme, a number of the jokes are funny and several of the actor's providing the animal voices do fine work. Norm Macdonald is quite likable as the sarcastic Lucky. If only he had been this engaging in ""Dirty Work,"" his own recent comedy misfire. Garry Shandling and Julie Kavner are funny as squabbling pigeons and Albert Brooks contributes a sympathetic performance as a sick tiger. Look for quick, but cute, voice work from Paul Reubens as a raccoon, and Gilbert Gottfried as an obsessive-compulsive dog. On the other side of the coin, Chris Rock is just loud and irritating as a guinea pig with attitude.  And then there's Eddie Murphy. In a lapse of judgment more annoying than the potty-humor fixation, Murphy is cast in a role where he has little to do but react, wasting the actor's comedic skills. Noticing that their star has nothing to do, the desperate writers insert a mawkish subplot in order to give Eddie the chance to deliver a heartfelt speech or two. It doesn't help.  Despite a few good scenes, ""Doctor Dolittle"" is a drag, a phenomenal waste of a good concept and a talented actor. How did such a misfire occur? My theory is that someone told the writers that they should create a film like ""that charming comedy about a pig."" Then, in doing research, they made the fatal mistake of studying ""Porky's"" instead of ""Babe."" ",Dr. Dolittle,PG-13,1998,1.5
271,"In DR. DOLITTLE 2, Eddie Murphy repeats his role as the sweet doctor who hasthe gift of gab with animals.  With female humans, especially his nowdating, 16-year-old daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone), Dr. Dolittle isanything but the alpha male that he tries to get his animal friends to be.   A sometimes cute but too often flat tale, this sequel tries to get by witheasy to devise, recycled humor ranging from piles of pigeon poop to a large,gaseous bear (voiced by Steve Zahn).  Even the music choices lackoriginality.  How many movies have featured ""I Will Survive"" recently?There are so many that I've lost count. Sometimes redoing old themes can be funny.  The best of these is a takeoffon THE GODFATHER, in which a beaver offers the doctor some fish in returnfor future services.  When he refuses to accept the fish, Joey the Raccoon(voiced by Michael Rapaport) warns him, ""Hey, the beaver offers you fish.You take the fish!"" Using the canonical kids' movie theme, the story features evil andunscrupulous big businessmen -- Are there any other kind in kids' shows? --who are out to despoil the environment.  Specifically, these guys, played byJeffrey Jones and Kevin Pollak, work for a lumber company that is going tocut down trees so that people can live in houses.  Shocking. Still, some of the animals are cute.  Pepito (voiced by Jacob Vargas), forexample, is a chameleon with a ""broken blender.""  No matter how hard hetries to switch color schemes, he just stays an icky green.  And some of thescenes, like one involving a dog support group, in which the doctor has thedogs repeat in unison, ""I am somebody's best friend,"" will bring a smile toyour face.  The result is an innocuous, but far from inspired film.  Waitfor video when the rental price will better reflect the value of theentertainment. DR. DOLITTLE 2 runs 1:21.  It is rated PG for language and crude humor andwould be acceptable for most kids. My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ***, liking the animal humor and the funnymusical numbers.  His cousins, Jacob, age 8, and Matthew, age 5, both gaveit *** as well.  Jacob's favorite part was ""the bear going to the bathroom,""and Matthew liked the talking bear parts best.  None of them laughed muchduring the movie, but they smiled a lot.",Dr. Dolittle 2,PG,2001,2
272," Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere) is an outrageouslysuccessful Dallas gynecologist who genuinely cares for his patientsand dotes on his wife and daughters. His problem: he worships women,referring to them as ""saints. "" He's a genuinely nice man, surroundedby a kaleidoscope of neurotic, mostly unpleasant females. After she'sarrested for cavorting nude in a public fountain, it's obvious thathis wife (Farrah Fawcett) has regressed into a childlike state beforethe extravagant society wedding of their cheerleader daughter (KateHudson) who, according to their other daughter (Tara Reid), is havingan affair with her enigmatic maid-of-honor (Liv Tyler). His boozysister-in-law (Laura Dern), in the midst of a divorce, has moved inwith her three little girls. And controlling the chaos of hisoverbooked practice falls on his adoring office-manager (ShelleyLong).  It's no wonder that he flees to the country club, where hefinds solace with the level-headed, briskly independent, new assistantgolf pro (Helen Hunt). Written by Ann Rapp and directed by RobertAltman, who collaborated on ""Cookie's Fortune,"" this stingingcharacter study and satiric social commentary with its curiouslytwisted ending has a distinctly misogynistic undertone. Certainly, thevulnerability of a woman with her legs in stirrups during agynecological exam is ripe for humor - ""That man knows how to handle aspeculum!"" - but Richard Gere plays the charming doctor like anamiable sap who's constantly victimized by the privileged, pamperedshrews who surround him with their shrill cacophony of whining,demanding voices. Lyle Lovett's honky-tonk score provides welcomedistraction. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Dr. T and theWomen"" is a flimsy 4. It's an irreverent, estrogen-enhanced farce thatjust isn't very funny. ",Dr. T and the Women,R,2000,2.5
273,"A lame attempt to draw in the same audience that went wild over 1999's""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Dragonfly"" is a supernatural mystery that doesn'tknow whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepymelodrama. It ends up being neither, and fails at both endeavors.For Kevin Costner (2001's ""3000 Miles to Graceland""), a once-prosperousactor who has suffered as of late due to some poor career moves, thisnonsensical rubbish is not a step in the right direction. And fordirector Tom Shadyac (1998's reviled ""Patch Adams,"" 1995's ""Ace Ventura:When Nature Calls""), this is simply further proof that he wears hisdrippy heart on his sleeve and his mind in the trash can as a filmmaker.  Even before the opening credits are over, Dr. Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner)is grief-stricken when his pregnant physician wife, Emily (SusannaThompson), in Venezuela working as a Red Cross volunteer, dies ina tragic bus accident. Because Emily was such a valiant do-gooder,Joe's friends assure him that she is in a better place. Joe, a devoutatheist, doesn't believe their words of solace until he begins receivingominous signs that Emily may be trying to contact him from anotherworld. For one, the ill children in her hospital ward start speakingof seeing her at a rainbow during near-death experiences, and thevisions Joe gets are just too real for everything to be in his mind. Absurdly written by David Seltzer (1998's ""My Giant""), Brandon Camp,and Mike Thompson, ""Dragonfly"" is a sluggishly paced brain-teaserthat, once the token ""big"" twist arrives at the end, adds up to frustratinglylittle. Before the amazingly sloppy third act, which causes the firsttwo to make even less sense, the film runs on a straight and narrowline of being neither overtly bad nor remotely good. It is one ofthose movies that is just ""there,"" with no scenes or story developmentsarriving to make things interesting. The half-hearted scares director Shadyac occasionally injects intothe film are all for nil, since Joe is allegedly trying to be contactedby an inherently good woman who loved him. No rhyme or reason is madeabout why, in the process, she doesn't just find a way to tell himher message, rather than pussyfoot around with faint, obscure spook tactics. Kevin Costner stole the show in his last picture, the underrated ""3000Miles to Graceland,"" but he acts like a piece of wood here. As thehaunted Joe, Costner broods his way through the film with no otherapparent emotions. His relationship with Emily, cursorily shown inflashbacks, lacks the unrequited love and devotion necessary for thestory to resonate within the viewer.  Save for another effective performance by Kathy Bates (2001's ""RatRace""), as Joe's caring neighbor friend, the supporting roles arehaphazardly executed, each one popping in and out of the movie atsuch a clip rate that none are developed or receive closure. LindaHunt (1997's ""The Relic""), as a nun studying near-death experienceswhom Joe seeks advice from, has only two scenes, and is memorableenough that she should have either had more to do or been droppedfrom the final cut. In a brief five-minute role as a suicidal hospitalpatient, the wonderful Liza Weil (1998's ""Nowhere,"" 1999's ""Stir ofEchoes"") elicits the type of truthful poignancy that puts the moreobvious and maudlin elements of the film to shame. With unavoidable similarities to the notably superior thriller froma month ago, ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" the already tedious ""Dragonfly""stands out like an even bigger sore thumb. With a music score by JohnDebney (2002's ""Snow Dogs"") that is so forgettable to appear almostnonexistent, and underlit, flat cinematography by Dean Semler (2000's""Nutty Professor II: The Klumps""), not much of anything has fallensuccessfully into place. ""Dragonfly"" ends up certainly not being atouching drama, and the only thing scary about it is the thought ofcomic director Tom Shadyac making another attempt at a serious film.""Patch Adams"" proved that he stinks at it, and ""Dragonfly"" solidifies that.",Dragonfly,PG-13,2002,1.5
274,"      DRAGONHEART is a live action sword-and-sorcery fable set in ""AD984.""  It features a large and fascinating dragon that is apparentlycreated with animatronics.  The technical aspects of the show are thebest part.  Watching the fluid movements of the dragon is amazing.Notice especially how realistic his teeth are.  Sad to say, that thereis not much else worthwhile in the picture.  Don't get me wrong.  Thisis not a bad film; it is just a disappointing one.  My son, on theother hand, loved it.       The dragon's name is Draco and his voice is by Sean Connery.Although I am a fan of Connery's, I thought his voice added little.Dennis Quaid plays Bowen, who prides himself as being a ""knight of oldcode.""  He tries to teach the young King Einon (David Thewlis fromBLACK BEAUTY) to follow the code, but the king rebels and becomes atyrant.       Most of the show consists of Bowen first trying to kill all of thedragons, and then getting in a league with Draco to scam the localvillagers.  Many people are killed in the show.  This varies fromrealistic stabbings to a few very bloody scenes.  Most of the blood isat the beginning.  I thought Jeffrey (age 7) was going to force us toleave.  He was so upset he could not look at the screen.  He whisperedto me, ""why do they have all of this blood?""  Why indeed?  This is akids' show and the realistic blood with the gaping wound had no placein it.  Other than to scare the wits out of its intended audience,there is no reason for it.  Yes, the film is rated PG-13 so we werefully warned, but still it is not necessary and adds nothing to thepicture.       I must admit that not being a sword-and-sorcery fan, I had troublebelieving that a knight equipped only with a sword could kill dragonsthat are two stories tall, that can fly, that have a tail that cancrush buildings in a single blow, that can shoot fire for hundreds ofyards and that have a jaw big enough to eat a man in a single bite.Check your brain at the door.       Julie Christie, who was so wonderful as Lara in Doctor Zhivago andunmemorable in everything since, is again wasted as the king's motherAislinn.  Pete Postlethwaite gives a fun minor performance as the monkGilbert.  Gilbert is always composing verse on the fly, and his dialogis quite funny.       Actually my favorite line in the script by Charles Edward Pogue isone of Draco's.  When Bowen wants him to eat the beautiful maiden Kara(Dina Meyer), he refuses.  Bowen insists that Draco has done it before,but in a take off on our president's ""I didn't inhale"" line, Dracosays, ""I mainly chewed in self-defense.  I didn't swallow.""  Draco isalso a philosopher.  He tells Bowen, ""when you squeeze the nobility,you hurt the peasants.""       The script and the direction (Rob Cohen) drags a lot.  It gets waytoo wordy at times.  The majestic and sweeping music (Randy Edelman)helps keep the show from hopeless bogging down.  The cinematography(David Eggby) is lush and the sets (Benjamin Fernandez) are visuallyinteresting.  The costumes (Anna Shepherd), especially those of thefemale dragon slayer, reminded me of caricatures of bad Wagnerian operacostumes from the turn of the century.  I half expected someone tostart singing The Ride of Valkyries.       The ending is well done.  Notice the pupils in Bowen's eyes at theend.  They capture the magic of the show quite well.       DRAGONHEART runs 1:43.  It is rated PG-13 for way too realisticviolence.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad language.  My son Jeffreysays he loved the show, but that kids should be at least 6 to see it.He liked it so much, he wants to see it again with some of his friends.Once was once too many for me.  I give it a mild thumbs down andgenerously award it **. ",Dragonheart,PG-13,1996,2
275," ""Dream With the Fishes,"" the film debut of director Finn Taylor that premiered at Sundance, is a peculiar, unconventional little film, but one that is extremely well-written and carefully handled.   At the start of the film, we meet Terry (David Arquette), a young man in his 20's who is a very lonely person, and spends his time acting as a peeping tom towards the people that live in the building beside his. One night during an attempted suicide, he meets Nick (Brad Hunt), one of his spying subjects, whom has a fatal disease and is going to die in a few weeks. It seems Terry is depressed because of the death of his wife in a car accident. Since one wants to die, and the other is definately going to, they form a sort of dysfunctional bond with each other, and proceed to live out some of their fantasies, such as nude bowling and taking acid. When they travel to Nick's hometown, they are greeted unfavorably by his father (J.E. Freeman), who wants nothing to do with him. Instead, they end up staying at the home of his Aunt Elise (Cathy Moriarty), an understanding former stripper. Soon, Nick's live-in girlfriend, Liz (Kathryn Erbe), who Terry secretly fantasizes about, catches up with them.  By the sound of, ""Dream With the Fishes,"" it may seem like a film that might have very little story, and one that might meander, but that isn't the case at all, primarily due to Finn Taylor's smart, offbeat screenplay. But then again, this isn't really a ""plot""-style film as much as it is a ""character"" film, and that is one of the great joys in watching it. The characters are all fascinating people, and it is fun to follow them through the film to see what happens next, which is mostly because of the fact that it is completely unpredictable. The most interesting character is Liz, who is obsessed with tatoos and on the surface is quite hard-edged, but slowly begins to hint that that might just be a facade to hide under. After all, she does very much care for Nick, and is sympathetic towards Terry's problems. Kathryn Erbe plays her wonderfully, and she is a talented actress who has been very good before in other films, particularly 1993's sweet slice-of-life, ""Rich in Love."" Also standing out is Cathy Moriarty, who almost always brings something special to every role she plays.  Aside from the performances and characters, another plus is the exuberant soundtrack, which includes an especially appropriate song, ""Fisherman's Blues,"" by The Waterboys.   With ""Dream With the Fishes,"" Finn Taylor has proven himself to be an original director that is definately someone to look for in the future. He has a way with words, characters, and what is most surprising is how touching much of the film is without ever taking the easy route, and going for obviousness or predictable, maudlin melodrama.  ",Dream With the Fishes,R,1997,3

Setin Mount Rose, Minnesota, it purports to examine a small-town beautypageant. Here in the hallowed American heartland, amidst cow pats andpork sausage, there's an all-out battle being waged for the sparklingtiara. Denise Richards plays a spoiled little rich girl whose primarytalent seems to be sucking up to the judges, mouthing banalplatitudes, and dedicating her rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes OffYou"" to Jesus Christ. Kirstie Alley plays her scheming mother, aformer winner, who also serves as the pageant's coordinator. The onlyreal competition comes from a sweet, guileless, tap-dancing trailerpark girl, Kirsten Dunst, who worships Diane Sawyer and wants tobecome a television journalist.

Not that beauty pageants aren't ripefor satire, but ""Smile"" (1975) did it so much better - and it didn'tneed to travel to the Eating Disorder wing of the localhospital.

From the very first frame, the movie doesn't have any illusions that it's anything more than a self-proclaimed stupid comedy. Instantly forgettable and lacking anything resembling honest human emotions, the first half is so bright and silly that it gets your expectations up far too much. Its surprising success right from the get-go hurts the final product more than helps it, as its jokes quickly grows tiresome and repetitive, until the movie becomes almost unbearable in its final thirty minutes.  Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) are stoner best friends who wake up one morning to find that their car has disappeared.

""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is so unabashedly dumb that you can't help but be a little impressed by its own throwaway trashiness.

Kutcher, especially, stands out as having quite an enjoyable presence, and it's not difficult to see him making more substantial motion pictures in the future. Since Jesse and Chester fill up every frame, they leave little room for anyone else. Marla Sokoloff (2000's ""Whatever It Takes"") and Jennifer Garner (TV's ""Felicity"") are briefly on hand as their respective girlfriends, while the unfortunate Kristy Swanson (1999's ""Big Daddy"") has clearly fallen on hard times by taking such a wasted role.  There are a couple comic sequences that work extremely well--far more than they have any right to. An encounter with a pushy, stubborn worker at a Chinese drive-thru, and a dog that does nothing but smoke pot and lie around, are admittedly a riot, as is an unpredictable kiss between the two male leads that rivals the on-screen smooch between Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1998's infinitely superior ""BASEketball."" All of these setpieces, however, appear by the 40-minute mark, and it is followed by a comic dead zone in the increasingly preposterous climax.  ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" is terrible as a film, yet passable entertainment as a movie. 13-to-16-year-olds will likely have the most fun, and one's tolerance for strictly juvenile humor will decide what other age frame might enjoy such fodder.

279,"The initial pitch for ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"" mighthave sounded like an interesting idea. Without the participation ofJim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the original stars of 1994's ""Dumb andDumber,"" the sequel would actually be a prequel, chronicling how theworld's dumbest pair of friends first met back in their high schooldays, circa 1986. Under the unwatchful helm of writer-director TroyMiller and co-screenwriter Robert Brenner, however, the results areless than admirable and almost completely devoid of any comedic inspiration.When all is said and done, ""Dumb and Dumberer"" is nothing more thana cheap-looking, desperate attempt by New Line Cinema to ruthlesslysuck the pockets dry of every fan of its infinitely superior predecessor. The premise is every bit as dim-witted as its lead characters, LloydChristmas (Eric Christian Olsen) and Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson).After literally knocking into each other, Lloyd and Harry meet onthe first day of the new school year and, with their intelligence(or lack thereof) equaling each other's, they become quick comrades.They are instantly elected into a year-long ""Special Needs"" classheaded by Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) and his daffy girlfriend,school lunchlady Ms. Heller (Cheri Oteri), and soon have enrolleda rag-tag group of lazy teen misfits to join them. What Harry andLloyd fail to realize, and lovely school reporter Jessica Matthews(Rachel Nichols) suspects, is that their new class is nothing morethan a scam by Principal Collins and Ms. Heller to swindle money froma charity fundraiser. ""Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd"" is asinine, lame, and pointless.Its scope is minuscule, its plot is inconsequential fluff (even bythe standards of a low-brow teen comedy), and its idea of sparklingcomedy is to show Harry and Lloyd playing a game of tag in a conveniencestore, much to the annoyance of the fed-up clerk. Harry and Lloydmay be total lunkheads, but the humor that was elicited from thisvery fact in the original ""Dumb and Dumber"" was clever, smart, andgenuinely funny. Meanwhile, ""Dumb and Dumberer"" reaches for the lowest-common-denominatorat every turn. Unlike comedy kings Bobby and Peter Farrelly, directorTroy Miller has no idea how to adequately set up a joke and milk itfor all its worth. In all fairness, there's no good material to milk even if he could. Even the film's portrayal of the 1980's is all wrong, with a soundtrackthat features far more current song selections than those from thedecade it is actually set in. The production design by Paul Hugginsand costumes by Susanna Puisto are uninspired, at best. And the chippedfront tooth that Lloyd sports is laughably fake, appearing as if ablack marker was sloppily run over it before every scene. For a big-screenventure, ""Dumb and Dumberer"" too often feels like a movie made bymiddle-schoolers with a budget to meet their weekly allowances. By comparison, the cast is eclectic and energetic--two adjectivesa viewer is sure not to use while describing anything else about thisfailure of a movie. As Harry and Lloyd, newcomer Derek Richardsonand Eric Christian Olsen (2001's ""Not Another Teen Movie"") so closelyresemble their famed older counterparts, Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey,it often seems as if the original actors were transported back intime. Richardson and Olsen keep up surprisingly high spirits as theywade through scene after aimless scene. Rachel Nichols (2000's ""Autumnin New York"") also shows some vivacious spark as the object of Harryand Lloyd's affections, Jessica Matthews.  As the nefarious Principal Collins, the participation of Eugene Levy(2003's ""A Mighty Wind"") is mindboggling. Now that he is a hot commoditydue to the ""American Pie"" series, Levy certainly couldn't have beenso hard-up for work as to have been forced into such a dreary role,but here is. Cheri Oteri (2000's ""Scary Movie"") has slightly moreto do as Ms. Heller, bringing her usual offbeat attributes to a one-dimensionalpart. And as the other ""Special Needs"" students, Elden Henson (2001's""O""), Shia LaBeouf (2003's ""Holes""), Michelle Krusiec (2002's ""SweetHome Alabama""), and Josh Braaten show signs that they are certainlymore capable than what is demanded of them here. Whereas ""Dumb and Dumber"" was not only a well-written ""stupid"" comedy,it was also kind of sweet in its scenes with love interest LaurenHolly. ""Dumb and Dumberer"" is just plain moronic, holding its audiencein contempt and expecting them to be as brain-deficient as Harry andLloyd by not realizing a bad movie when they see one. Luckily, atonly 83 minutes, it's over before it really has a chance to becomeunbearable. That is about the biggest compliment that could possiblybe paid to ""Dumb and Dumberer."" At least they got the title right.",Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd,PG-13,2003,1
280,"Dune, the classic science fiction novel by Frank Herbertupon which this movie is based, is a novel in which a complex and richlytextured world is created and which is populated by equallycomplex characters.  The main plotline involves the struggleof Paul Atreides to assume leadership of the plaent Arakis, alsoknown as Dune.  Given such complexity and the huge scopeof the (very lengthy) novel, it was hard for me to imagine the movie industrydoing justice to the novel-- something which I felt was confirmed by thecommercial failure of the movie.  At that point I resolved to not see it for fear of it spoiling my appreciation of the novel, which Ihave re-read at least five times. Dune eventually appeared on the science fiction channel and following apositive comment by an acquaintance, I decided to watch the movie. As it turns out, Dune  does  capture the spirit and the complexity ofthe novel, and is visually impressive and stylish (clearly showing theinfluence of David Lynch).  The main problem with the movie isthat in attempting to preserve the richness and complexity ofthe novel, David Lynch made a movie that was often incomprehensible. Anyone who has read the book before watching the movie will realize that thereare an many important subtleties that one could never understand fromthe movie alone.  The interesting thing is that if you arefamiliar with the story, then I think this approach actuallyresults in a  better , more involving, and interesting, movie.For this reason, I recommend the movie to those who have read the bookand to those who have not-- read the book and then watch the movie.",Dune,PG-13,1984,3
281,"     What's in your imagination is usually far better than whatfilmmakers can project on the screen and never was that more true thanwith this tedious sword & sorcery epic that lifts liberally from ""StarWars,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Hercules,"" ""Xena: Warrior Princess""and the old ""Sinbad"" movies. Based on an elaborate role-playing gamewhich has intrigued young minds since 1974, the plot revolves around ayoung thief (Justin Whalin), his buddy (Marlon Wayans), and a prettymagician (Zoe McLellan) who become embroiled in a battle between theidealistic Empress of Izmer (Thora Birch), who wants equality andprosperity for all her people, and the evil sorcerer Profion (JeremyIrons), who wants to depose her. Since the Empress has a scepter tosummon Golden Dragons, Profion dispatches his henchman (Bruce Payne)to find the Rod of Savrille that summons a stronger species, the RedDragons. Written by Topper Lilien & Carroll Cartwright and directed byCourtney Solomon, it's quite confusing and complicated. The acting,however, is abominable.  Justin Whalin - dismissed by the villain as""Pretty Boy"" - smirks and struts like Han Solo, while Marlon Wayansmugs outrageously in a JarJar Binks imitation and Thora Birch does herPrincess Leia routine.  Jeremy Irons is ludicrous with his leers, andBruce Payne has a perpetual sneer on his metallic blue lips. Sowhere's the $36 million budget? Visual effects. I did like the elveswith their Vulcan ears, but movies based on games rarely satisfy theircore audience. Remember ""The Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Clue""?  On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a cheap,cheesy 3. At one point, Wayans wails, ""This is dumb, dumb, dumb."" Iagree. And Payne promises, ""It was a mistake. It will not happenagain."" One hopes. ",Dungeons and Dragons,PG-13,2000,1
282,"Director Danny DeVito, who specializes in biting dark comedies (1987's""Throw Momma From the Train,"" 1989's ""The War of the Roses,"" 2002's""Death to Smoochy""), does it again with ""Duplex."" An occasionallyuproarious entertainment, it is superior to all of the above becauseit keeps its edge intact without wavering too far into the meanspiritednessthat has plagued some of his earlier work.   Novelist Alex (Ben Stiller) and magazine editor Nancy (Drew Barrymore)are a loving yuppie couple who, in planning a future that involveschildren and a safer environment, decide to move from their crampedManhattan apartment into a Brooklyn townhouse. The spacious duplexthey are offered is ideal for raising a family, and Realtor Kenneth(Harvey Fierstein) assures them that their upstairs tenant, the elderlyMrs. Connolly (Eileen Essel), is nearing the end of her life. Onceshe passes away, they can have the whole place to themselves. Uponmoving in, however, Alex and Nancy discover Mrs. Connolly to be thetenant from hell, a sickeningly sweet and healthy bat who keeps themup all night with her television and is constantly demanding choresof them. Driven to the point where they can't take Mrs. Connolly anymore,Alex and Nancy decide that a lethal plan of action may be their onlyanswer to living happily ever after.   Written by John Hamburg (2000's ""Meet the Parents"") and Larry Doyle(TV's ""The Simpsons""), ""Duplex"" is fast-paced, witty, and expertlyset up to maximize its comedic potential. One of the more consistentlyfunny motion pictures of the year, the film uses all avenues of humorphysical,verbal, and scatologicalto garner a heaping of major laughs. Comichighlights include Alex's trip to the pharmacy and grocery store withMrs. Connolly, who counts everything from her prescription pills tograpes and blueberries; a feud concerning Mrs. Connolly's clap-sensitivetelevision; Alex and Nancy's voyage to picking up the flu so theycan pass it on to Mrs. Connolly; and Mrs. Connolly's description ofthe stairs' carpeting: ""It's looser than a Dublin whore!""   Because the viewer is supposed to like Alex and Nancy, its most trickyhurdle was clearly to keep them sympathetic even as they plot themurder of a feisty old lady. Director Danny DeVito succeeds splendidlyat this. Mrs. Connolly is maddeningly hateful by the very nature ofher habits and selfishness, and her kindly outward demeanor only makesher all the more spiteful. When Alex and Nancy take matters into theirown hands, their choice is truly understandable.   Ben Stiller (2001's ""Zoolander"") and Drew Barrymore (2002's ""Charlie'sAngels: Full Throttle"") prove to be a dynamite team who play the realismout of every situation while getting to put their comedic skills togrand use. Alex and Nancy's frustrations over Mrs. Connolly are easilyidentifiable, as everyone has had someone in their life who has rubbedthem the wrong way, and Stiller and Barrymore do fine work in keepingtheir character's likable but at the end of their ropes. As good asthey are, the true star of the film is 86-year-old newcomer EileenEssel as Mrs. Connolly. Essel is a comic genius in her every momenton screen, full of energy, syrupy sweetness, and feuding grotesquery.   The first half of ""Duplex,"" in which Alex and Nancy are driven madby their tenant, is better than its latter, where they go to any lengthsnecessary to kill her. While the movie is wickedly funny and fullof energy throughout, the very lengths that Alex and Nancy do go throughstraddle the lines of implausibility (even for a comedy). Their willingnessto destroy their house in order to off Mrs. Connolly seems nonsensical,since that is exactly what they are fighting for. Despite its shortcomingsas it races to the finish line, they cannot lessen the dark delightsand sizable guffaws that ""Duplex"" otherwise offers throughout its88-minute running time. The film is undemanding, sharply conceived(its twist ending works even better than it should), and a whole lot of fun. ",Duplex,PG-13,2003,3
283,"Steven Spielberg's much beloved film treasure, E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, iscoming to the big screen in a theater near you in celebration of its twentiethanniversary.  If you see it there, your heart will likely soar just likeElliot's does when E.T. lifts them both into the air on Elliot's bike.  Real classics improve with age as does E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, but, just tomake sure that the film is in tip-top form, Spielberg has tweaked it some byadding a few new scenes, including a hilarious bathtub one, improving thespecial effects some and remixing the sound to take better advantage of today'sspeaker systems.  The reality, however, is that the original was already greatso the improvements aren't that important.  The real treat is being able to seethe movie on the big screen again.  (It should be pointed out that a widelyreported change, the removal of the infamous ""penis breath"" epithet, did nothappen.  It's still there to worry worry-wart school administrators about theappropriateness of showing the movie at school.)  As most of us know by now, E.T. is an alien who is accidentally left behind onearth.  With gigantic, soulful eyes and arms so long that his hands drag theground, E.T. is easily the most adorable alien ever to grace the screen.  A sadbut sweet creature, he waddles his way to a house where three kids, Elliot(Henry Thomas), Michael (Robert MacNaughton) and Gertie (Drew Barrymore), aresort of watched over by their busy mom, Mary (Dee Wallace).  Like most parents,she's oblivious to the obvious for way too long.  Elliot is the first to discover E.T., whom he treats rather like the world'smost fascinating stray dog.  When they first meet, it's not clear who is morescared.  With eyes almost as big as E.T.'s, Thomas could have stolen the showwere it not for Barrymore.  Her sassy rendition of a big mouthed little charmerlays waste to anyone else who might try to upstage her.  If every kid were thiscute, we'd have nothing but kids' movies at the multiplex.  But even she isoutshined by E.T., who redefines cute.  The movie, which is much slower paced than most movies today, especially kids'pictures, contains some great lines and wonderful sight gags. The best of theseis E.T.'s hiding amongst a bunch of stuffed animals.    You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll have a great time.  Be like Gertie, who cannever keep a secret.  Tell everyone you know that they don't want to miss thisrare opportunity to view this great motion picture on the big screen.  E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL runs 2:00.  It is rated PG for ""language and mildthematic elements"" and would be a great choice for all ages.  My son Jeffrey, almost 13, gave it *** 1/2, commenting on how extremely funnythe film is.  His friend John, age 13, gave it *** 1/2 as well.  He liked thenew scenes but thought E.T.'s motions aren't as good as they used to be.  John'stwin Steven, gave it ****, saying that it is his favorite film.  He thought thechanges made the movie slightly more dramatic and less scary.

284," We're obviously a nation besotted with celebrity, fame, andseeing ourselves on TV. If you doubt it, watch the crowds that gatheroutside NBC in Rockefeller Center every morning to wave and mug forthe ""Today"" show cameras. ""ED tv"" is about a goofy, ordinary guy fromTexas - Matthew McConaughey - who is catapulted to instant successwhen his photogenic face is spotted by ""True TV"" producer EllenDeGeneres, who is determined to air someone ""live"" on cable 24hours-a-day.  From video store clerk to TV star in days...is that thenew American Dream?  Unlike ""The Truman Show,"" in which Jim Carrey wasthe unwitting dupe, or ""Pleasantville,"" in which two teenagers getstuck in a '50s sit-com, the star of ""ED tv"" succumbs to theaphrodisiac of fame, volunteering to give up his dignity for thespotlight. After discussing it with his family (Woody Harrelson,Martin Landau, Sally Kirkland) McConaughey gamely allows camerasinstalled in his apartment to record his every move (except in thebathroom) and tries to ignore the three-man crew dogging his steps -until he falls in love with his brother's girl-friend, Jenna Elfman(who resembles a wannabe Renee Zellweger). Only when she resents theconstant intrusion does McConaughey realize what celebrity and thesacrifice of privacy really mean - but, by that time, the audience hasbecome addicted to watching his ""life"" unfold. Written by Lowell Ganzand Babaloo Mandel (""Parenthood,"" ""City Slickers"") and directed by RonHoward (""Ransom,"" ""Apollo 13""), ""ED tv"" is a relentlesslyentertaining, cleverly comical satire of our American obsession withthe limelight.

285,"      You may or may not think this is one of the best movies of theyear (Siskel and Ebert, I know, do), but for pushing the limits of anidea, the movie ED WOOD by director Tim Burton has got to be one of themost innovative.  I was surprised how much I liked Burton's vision ofED WOOD since I am not a fan of Burton's work other than his BATMANseries which I sort of liked.       Imagine making a movie about a director, Edward D.  Wood Jr., whowas voted the worst director of all time.  Not only that, Ed Wood madewhat is widely credited as being the worst movie of all time, PLAN 9FROM OUTER SPACE.  Moreover, he also made GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THEMONSTER, and other such classics.       There are two great things going for this movie.  One, is theamazing true life story.  Ed Wood was the eternal optimist who made onestinker after another, but still believed his next movie would be asuccess.  The other is the amazing and infectiously happy acting ofJohnny Depp (whom I loathed in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE) playing EdWood.  If you don't come out of this theater feeling upbeat, you musthave gone in the wrong door in the multiplex.  If the movie you saw wasnot filmed (Stefan Czapsky) in glorious black and white, then you sawthe wrong movie.       Actually one of the problems I had with the movie was that it isplaying the movie house with screens the size of small states.  This isstrictly an art house flick.  This was a real problem for me.       Back to the fascinating story.  You get to meet Bela Lugosi playedby Martin Landau.  At Oscar time, expect to see nominations for bestactor to Depp and supporting actor to Landau.  The movie happens duringat a time when Lugosi career was about over with which is somewhat of aparallel to Landau's career, before this movie.       This is one of those films filled with minor actors and actressesyou have seen before.  Sarah Jessica Parker, who was great in HONEYMOONIN VEGAS, plays Wood's girlfriend.  Jeffrey Jones, the principal fromFERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, plays Criswell, the ""great"", well famous,psychic of the time.  G.D.  Spradlin who played the evil Senator, theone with the dead horse in his bed, from GODFATHER II, here plays thehead preacher of the Beverly Hill Baptist Church which aids Wood's mosttrashy classic.  Fact is stranger than fiction.       Since I have never liked Johnny Depp nor Tim Burton very much,that I am liked this film at all, is probably a testament to just howgood it is.  If you like Burton movies, hey, you are probably going togo gaga over ED WOOD.       As fascinating as the plot of this movie was, I found it lost myinterest in parts.  There is just so much to say about someone whosespecialty is making something terrible.  Nevertheless, if you likequirky movies or if you are interested in the art of making movies, Iam sure you will like this film.       ED WOOD runs a little long at 2:05.  The movie is rated R forprofanity, cross-dressing, and drug use, but it actually is a fairlyharmless movie.  I would have no trouble letting older teens see it,and you could take younger teens with you.  I recommend it to everyoneexcept the totally non-experimental types--you probably don't want totake ""the grandparents"" to see it.  I give ***. ",Ed Wood,R,1994,3
286,"   In this dark psychological drama, Jack Nicholson delivers awrenching performance as a stressed-out Reno police detective facingretirement. On his last day at work, there's a grisly homicide. Aneight year-old girl has been found slashed, raped and mutilated in theNevada snow. Her distraught mother (Patricia Clarkson) forces him topromise to find the killer, intoning:""Do you swear by your soul'ssalvation on this cross made by our daughter?""  Despite the""confession"" of a retarded Native American (Benicio Del Toro), coercedby another cop (Aaron Eckhart), Nicholson is convinced that the childmolester is not only still free but will strike again. So heploddingly goes undercover, buying a local gas station and befriendinga battered single mom (Robin Wright Penn) with a trusting youngdaughter (Pauline Roberts) he can use as bait.    Judging by Sean Penn's first two films (""The Indian Runner,""""The Crossing Guard"") and this, his directing choices are as quirky ashis acting choices, beginning with extreme close-ups of Nicholson icefishing, armed with a bottle of Glenfiddich.  The sequence whereNicholson breaks the tragic news to the parents is set in the barn ofa turkey farm; it's a long shot with no dialogue. That scene isprofoundly moving, graceful and lyrical, as are Nicholson'sconversations with the child's grandmother (Vanessa Redgrave) and apsychologist (Helen Mirren). But the story by Frederick Durrenmatt(""The Visit""), adapted by Jerzy and Mary Olson-Kromolowski, is flatand deliberate, almost lethargic, framed by Nicholson's bizarreramblings and ruminations, resulting in an emotional detachment whichis hard to overcome. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""ThePledge"" is a haunting 8, emerging as a subtle study of pathologicalobsession. ","Edge, The",R,1997,2.5
287," Well, who would have thunk it? After an endless stream of mostly predictable and cliched movies set in high school in the last year, one has finally come along that is amazingly so precise, so hilarious, so biting, so smart, so perfect, in every one of its minute details that it comes as a sort of godsend. Its name is ""Election,"" it's directed by Alexander Payne (1996's ""Citizen Ruth""), and it, no doubt, will go down as one of the very best films of 1999.  Set at Omaha's Carver High School during the election for student council, the film imaginatively is narrated by all four of the main characters so that we can learn and understand the innerworkings of their minds, even when they are saying the opposite of the actions they are making. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, coming full circle from his role in 1986's classic ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") is the school's most popular teacher, a guy who has won the Best Teacher Award for three years running and who shows up at school nice and early each day. Friendly to (almost) all of his pupils, the one student who manages to get under his skin so much that he can't stand her is overachieving senior Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon), currently running unopposed for school president. If you're old enough to have experienced high school, you've definately run into someone like Tracey. She's the ""perfect"" student, a person who seems friendly to everyone even though you can see through their thin facade; a person who constantly raises their hand in class and knows every answer to every question; and a person who you know, no matter what, is going to achieve everything that he or she strives for in life. It's just Mr. McAllister's luck, then, that he happens to also run the student elections and, determined to cause Tracey to lose just one thing in her life, he convinces naively cheerful football jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who has recently broken his leg in a skiing accident, to run against her for president. Altough at first hesitant, Paul quickly grows eager to join the race, causing Tracey to grow outraged. For her, this means war. But that's not all; in a plot twist whose particulars should be discovered on your own, Paul's younger, rebellious sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a sophomore, also enters into the race, causing a three-way tug-of-war between Tammy, who poses to the students that she doesn't even care if she wins the election, and as president, won't do anything; Paul, who is joyous just to be in the running; and dear, dear Tracey, who will go to any length possible to ensure her ultimate defeat.  Reading the premise, ""Election"" may sound like ""just another teen flick,"" but it isn't by a long shot, and is in its masterful treatment that it succeeds so highly. I can assure you there is no climax set at the prom, and the story doesn't cowardly degenerate into a romance concerning which guy gets the girl. No, what ""Election"" is is a brilliantly articulated satire, a ""high school"" movie that is probably targeted more towards adults, but that all thoughtful teens will greatly appreciate as a much-needed diversion from all of those sugar-coated teen fantasies that have assaulted the multiplex in recent months.   Although ""about"" a high school election, it gradually grows clear that telling such a simple, clear-cut story isn't director Payne's intentions. Not only is there a heavy dosage of narration by the four principle characters, but the film also isn't always told chronologically, as each plot thread is carefully and delightfully torn away to not only create a more meaningful motion picture, but also one that has something to say about loneliness. Through the big, sly laughs that the film creates, it is revealed that each of the characters are lonely, in their own certain way, and we are taken into each one of their lives to learn just why they are the way they are.  For example, we eventually find that Jim McAllister is obviously unhappily married (even though he says during narration that his wife is ""his source of strength""). When his buddy and a fellow teacher, Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik), is fired for having a sexual relationship with one of his students, Jim grows closer to Dave's solemn wife, spending more and more time with her and convincing himself that he loves her, not realizing that it isn't love that draws them together, but desperation. Jim's life is a monotonous and dull routine, as he goes to school, teaches the same things over day after day, and then goes home to the same woman that he has been married to for nine years. Certainly a lot of people have this sort of life, but Jim needs more. Matthew Broderick, who has fallen on hard times in recent years (1997's ""Addicted to Love,"" 1998's ""Godzilla""), has revitalized his career with ""Election,"" and has, indeed, given his strongest, most gratifying performance since ""Ferris Bueller"" thirteen years ago. We don't just see his sadness, we feel it.  Matching Broderick in every way is Reese Witherspoon, maybe the most talented actress under 25 working today, who has never been better. It would be criminal to see her flawless, nuanced, and hilarious performance get snubbed of an Oscar nomination come next year. Witherspoon transforms herself so completely into the heart, soul, and body of Tracey that it will be difficult from now on to distinguish the two personalities, although she is so wonderful in every film that she should have no trouble doing just that. In the character of Tracey Flick, we have also been given one of the most distinguished and memorable characters I've probably ever seen in my years of film-watching. She is the type of girl who you really shouldn't like at all. She's perky, she's unblemished, she's successful, but she is also so desperate and determined to be a winner that you can't help but feel genuinely sorry for her when things don't go her way. Like Jim McAllister, no matter what feats Tracey seems to triumph over she remains a lonely person without any actual friends. In a couple brief scenes involving her paralegal mother (Colleen Camp), we get a few hints as to what made Tracey the way she is. Although loving, her mother strives for the same exact great success as Tracey.  Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell, two film newcomers, also fit neatly into their respective roles. Klein is probably the most completely likable character in the film, as his Paul comes off as always innocent, even after we see him doing several arguably negative things, because he is so unintelligible and dense that he never really comprehends the things he's doing. There's no denying, however, that Paul has a big heart, and he cares about others. Jessica Campbell turns in a touching performance as the outsider, Tammy, who is torn apart when the girl she loves breaks up with her. ""I'm not really a lesbian, though,"" Tammy reassures. ""It just so happens that so far all of the people I have been attracted to have been girls.""  If ""She's All That"" is ""'Pygmalion' set in a high school"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is ""'The Taming of the Shrew' set in a high school,"" ""Election"" is ""'Fargo' set in a high school,"" and out of the three the latter is definately the highest honor. We don't necessarily watch ""Election"" as much as we absorb every single second of its constant entertainment and pleasures, excited to find out where it will lead us. Of technical note, the music score by Rolfe Tent is distinct and often even gains laughs because of its frightening perfection, sort of like Tracey herself. Writers Payne and Jim Taylor have fashioned one of the most fresh and original screenplays to come along in some time, as it never condescends to any of its potential audience members, whether it be adults or teens. ""Election"" is a dazzling dark comedy, clear in both tone and substance, and has the ability to be rib-tickling one moment and poignant the next, all the while never losing sight of its truthfulness and courage. In a week when ""The Mummy"" will unfairly be the #1 movie in America, making tens of millions of dollars, ""Election"" is the real deal, and now that it is in wide release, make it an effort to go out and see this sure-to-be classic as soon as humanly possible. ",Election,R,1999,3.5
288,"ELEPHANT, which, except for the last ten minutes, would be better titledANOTHER BORING DAY IN THE LIFE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, is one of thoseannoying, aren't-we-clever productions.  Its cameras are in constant slowmotion as they pan the rooms, spending as much time on empty blackboards as onthe pupils.  For most of the movie, we examine in detail the minutia of teendomfrom picking among several undesirable choices in the cafeteria to attending aconsciousness-raising session of the Gay-Straight Alliance.    It should come as no surprise that the movie is by director Gus Van Sant, whoselast film was a two-person picture about two guys named Gerry who spent theentire movie wandering lost in the desert.  Zzzzzz.  He also did a shot-by-shotrecreation of Hitchcock's classic PSYCHO.  What a  r‰sum‰!  Van Sant's high concept this time is to make a movie inspired by the killingsat Columbine, something that was done better and more effectively in therecently released ZERO DAY, which would make an interesting candidate for adouble feature with ELEPHANT.  Both films suffer a fatal flaw, in that theyprovide little to no motivation for why a couple of average kids -- they aregay kids in ELEPHANT -- would want to senselessly slaughter their fellowclassmates.  After the camera has examined every nook and cranny of the school, the murdersfinally take place in the last act.  When they occur, they happen slowlywithout much emotion.  The sole point of the picture seems to be that incidentslike this can happen, but everyone already knows that.  The biggest mystery ishow this film got awarded the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival.  ELEPHANT runs 1:21.

289,"Many predict that the biggest political issues of nextcentury would be in the domain of ecology. Some of thosetrends can be observed even today, with the environmentalistmovements gaining strength all over the globe, and evencoming to power in countries like Germany. However, in1980s, care for the environment and long term interests ofhumanity didn't look that attractive or important during thereign of neo-conservative ideology, new Cold War and extremematerialism. In the beginning of 1990s things changed -environmentalism became fashionable in the era of emerging""political correctness"" so Hollywood tried to cash in. Theresults were mixed, somewhere between disasters(WATERWORLD), solid but overhyped epics (DANCES WITH WOLVES)and interesting failures (THE MEDICINE MAN). Unfortunately,that trend came too late for a movie that could have put allof them to shame - THE EMERALD FOREST, ecological adventureby John Boorman, made in 1985.  The plot of the movie is allegedly inspired by a true story.Bill Markham (Powers Boothe) is an American engineer workingon the great dam project in the middle of Amazon jungle. Oneday he brings his family to the building site, but thatlittle trip ends with his little son Tommy wandering in theforest. There he gets abducted by Indian tribe known as""Invisible People"". For the next ten years, Bill spendsevery spare moment to search for his son in the Amazon.Unfortunately, the ""Invisible People"" are one of thosetribes that haven't got any contact with the outside world.But that doesn't bother Tommy (Charly Boorman), who wasadopted by tribal chief Wanadi (Rui Polonah) and becamemember of the tribe himself. When Bill finally meets him,Tommy had already forgotten his parents and ""civilised"" wayof life. He seems happy with his life so he decides not tolisten to father's pleas for the return to civilisation.Father and son part again, but not for the last time.Village of the ""Invisible People"" gets attacked by the rivaltribe of ""Fierce People"" who take away all the women,including Tommy's wife Kachiri (Dira Paes) and sell them tothe sleazy brothel owners at the outskirts of jungle. Unableto fight guns with bows and spears, Tommy must seek hisfather's help, which brings him to dangerous journey to theheart of civilisation.  Unlike most ecological movies, that either try to shove theenvironmentalist agenda to the viewers' throats or, evenworse, use ecology as cheap excuse for lame action/thrillerplots, THE EMERALD FOREST was very subtle. That shouldn'tsurprise anyone, because the movie author, John Boorman,liked nature, its beauty and dangers, long before theenvironmental trends became fashionable. So, the tone of themovie isn't preachy - the script by Rosco Pallemberg was setin a virgin Amazon jungle threatened by an encroachingcivilisation, but Boorman was less interested in conflictbetween nature and progress than in splendid opportunity tomake very personal film - classical adventure that is almostimpossible to imagine in Hollywood these days. Boormanobviously liked what he was doing, because he chose histeenage son Charley to play Tommy; that choice was good,because that boy was perfect as lead character whosymbolises the innocence of the Amazon and the natural stateof man. His green eyes and innocent beauty corresponds withthe the innocent beauty of the rain forests. The nominallead, Powers Boothe, is shadowed by him, same as Meg Fosteras his mother, cast more because of her green eyes thanacting ability. Perhaps because of Boothe, the conflictbetween the father and son wasn't as powerful andinteresting as it should have been.  The opportunity to have some father/son drama with culturalclash themes, wasn't used in the first part, but some of thescript problems are more visible in the second. Boorman wasforced to admit that the Amazon jungle isn't thatall-friendly and blissful place, although Tommy and""Invisible People"" might see it that way. So, someone had torepresent the bad side of the Amazon, and that role wasfilled by the tribe of ""Fierce People"" - whose villainymight remind people of the native characters seen in theclassic Tarzan films (they are even painted black only toillustrate their allignment). The ""two tribe"" concept wasn'tthat simplistic, though; it is implied that the civilisationstripped away the forest that used to be the hunting groundfor the ""Fierce People"", thus forcing them to go to war withother people. However, the evil of the ""Fierce People"" isunderlined with the way they accept civilisation - unlikenoble and purist ""Invisible People"" who see white men as""Termite People"" (who eat away their world) and whose visionof ""Termite People"" world is frightening (as witnessed byTommy in his short trip to Bill's city), they are ready toaccept the civilisation - first guns, than liquor -corrupting and degrading themselves in the process.  Boorman brings film to the climax with the showdown in thebrothel, thus providing the audience with the standardaction scenes. But, instead of ending film immediately afterthat, with the bitter-sweet note (Bill warns that thecivilisation would win in the end), Boorman provides theaudience with implausible fairy tale finale - Indian prayersbring the flood that would take away the dam as the symbolof the civilisation. But that scene is made even moreimplausible with the addition of Bill who tries to blow uphis life's work in the process. The ending - Tommy, Kachiriand his friends living happily ever after in a naturalparadise - is bad contrast with the end credits, that warnthe audience about sad reality of the Amazon - destructionof the rain forests and silent genocide of the Indians.  However, despite all those flaws, THE EMERALD FOREST is notbeautiful and entertaining, but also a thought-provokingfilm - one of those who were right on the spot with manyburning issues of today's world. ","Emerald Forest, The",R,1985,3
290,"      EMMA is a delightful film about manners, marrying, letters, andgentility.  It is the most inconsequential of all of the recent JaneAustin books to reach the big screen (PERSUASION and SENSE ANDSENSIBILITY) or the little screen (""Pride and Prejudice"").  I am notsure if its lightweight stems from the novel itself or the adaptation,but it is nevertheless a sweet little film and well worth seeing.  Forthe record, my favorite Jane Austin movie remains PERSUASION which wasalso my favorite of all the 118 films I saw last year.  Finally, Ishould note that last year's CLUELESS was a modernized and looseadaptation of ""Emma.""       Gwyneth Paltrow (THE PALLBEARER and SEVEN) plays Emma Woodhouse.She is a young, rich and single woman who spends most of her time beinga matchmaker and an anti-matchmaker for her friends.  Most of herenergies are devoted to her close friend Harriet Smith (played by ToniCollette from MURIEL'S WEDDING and THE PALLBEARER), but she helpsothers as well.  As Miss Woodhouse explains to Mrs. Weston (GretaScacchi from JEFFERSON IN PARIS and A MAN IN LOVE), ""The most beautifulthing in the world is a match well made.""       Miss Woodhouse has a close male friend, Mr. Knightley (played byJeremy Northam from CARRINGTON and WUTHERING HEIGHTS), whom shesometimes refers to as her brother.  He is troubled that she imposesher will on her friends, saying, ""vanity working on a weak mindproduces all kinds of mischief.""  He admonishes her, ""better to bewithout sense than misapply it as you do.""  He feels he has a right togive her unsolicited advice since, ""is it not a brother's job to findfault with his sister?""       A key aspect of the show is the reverence that is shown toletters.  Upon receiving a letter, they pass them around with commentson everything from the words to the handwriting.  When Miss Smith getsa letter proposing marriage she inquires of Miss Woodhouse, ""Is it agood letter or too short?""       At the core of the show is the early nineteenth century obsessionwith excessive manners.  When Rev. Elton (Alan Cumming) annoys MissWoodhouse at a party by fawning over her wondering if she is too coldor too hot, she tells him without meaning it, ""thank you for being sothoughtful.""  To which he retorts in a cloying sweet voice, ""thank youfor thinking I was being so thoughtful.""  It is amazing that the wholecountry did not die from a massive diabetic attach given the level ofexcessive sweetness in the land.       The pretense of affection is frequently used as a shield as whenMiss Woodhouse decides to throw a party from Mrs. Elton (JulietStevenson).  Miss Woodhouse declares, ""I must throw a party otherwiseeveryone will see clearly how much I despise her.""  By the way, you mayremember Juliet Stevenson.  She was wonderful as Flora Matlock in theBritish TV show ""The Politician's Wife"" shown earlier this year on PBS.       The sets (Totty Whately) are sumptuous, and the cinematography(Ian Wilson) is warm and radiant.  The gowns and the headbands (RuthMyers) are elegant but so repetitive that the women look like they allgo to some parochial school where gowns are the uniforms.  A littlemore variety would have been welcome.  The music (Rachel Portman) isdreamy, and the sound (Chris Munro) is full of happily chirping birds.       The acting is all pleasant enough, but there is no depth to any ofit.  Since other Austin novels have had more dramatically drawncharacters, my guess is that director Douglas McGrath was trying tokeep the show at an ethereal level.  He also did the novel adaptationfor the screen which I liked better than his directing.  A thoroughlyenjoyable show, but it could have been better.       I did have a problem with Toni Collete's performance.  She wasplaying a ditzy woman, but she let her intelligence come through andmade her characterization somewhat unbelievable.  She was much moresuccessful in MURIEL'S WEDDING, where she was brilliant.       EMMA runs a well paced 1:58.  It was not yet rated when I saw itat the press screening, but my guess is that it will be rated PG.There is no nudity, violence, or bad language.  There is not sex unlessyou want to count the three brief kisses at the end.  It is a show thatdeserves a G rating, but I bet they put in a single bad word somewherethat I missed so they would avoid the less bankable G rating.  The showwould be fine for any kids old enough to be interested in a show aboutmanners and marrying.  My guess is that they would have to be 8 or 9 tobe interested, but if you want your 2 year old to see it, there isnothing to offend.  I recommend EMMA to you and give it ***. ",Emma,PG,1996,3
291,"Teaching at an inner-city high school may not be the life-threatening job faced by New York City firefighters, but thatprofession is considered by some to be the most difficult andstressful of all.  No wonder so many idealistic young people areattracted to the private schools, expensive for students but payinga poorer wage to its staff than government-supported institutions. If teaching at an exclusive prep school becomes as draining andfrustrating as doing the same at a government school, what's thepoint of taking the pay cut?  This is what came to mind as Iwatched Michael Hoffman's ""The Emperor's Club,"" based onEthan Canin's short story whose themes can be traced back toDr. Thomas Arnold's ""Tom Brown's Schooldays.""  Dr. Arnold, thefather of the great poet Matthew Arnold, believed that childrenwere not valuable souls in their own right but only half-formedadults who needed to be molded into shape.  You can't blameArthur Hundert (Kevin Kline) for agreeing as his job at an elite)school turns from idyllic to stormy once an obnoxious kid (StevenCulp) changes his alpha status.     Did I say stormy?  If that brings to mind the New York City bratsin Richard Brooks' 1955 movie ""Blackboard Jungle,"" forget it.  Thetroublemaker in Michael Hoffman's film based on a short story inEthan Canin's ""The Palace Thief"" would be called a goody-two-shoes if he were in a big city academy.  If commenting on the""dresses"" (merely togas, actually) that the young men in the thirdform class of Classics instructor Arthur Hundert (Kevin Kline)constitutes class disruption, give me 35 kids like Sedgewick Bell(Emile Hirsch), who begins his relationship as Mr. Hundert'snemesis and ends, of course, as teacher's pet.  What else didthis boy, the son of an obnoxious United Senator (Harris Yulin)that eventually led to the special call that the teacher paid to hisdad?  Why, he exposed his fellow fifteen-year-olds to a Playboy-type magazine!  (This, remember, was not in 1950 or in VictorianEngland, but in the early 1970s, during hippie heydays, when coolteens were more likely to participate in orgies than in bothering toread about them second hand through girlie magazines.)      ""The Emperor's Club"" is a sincere movie, exquisitely acted byKevin Kline (no surprise there), using a script over which MichaelMedved and William Bennett would jump for joy.  It has a PG-13rating, probably because one of the kids says a vulgarism not inclass but in the dormitory of St. Bartholomew's Academy justonce, mind you, probably said more to allow the producers toavoid an uncool PG rating than to titillate the teens.  Like RobinWilliams' character in Peter Weir's 1989 film ""Dead PoetsSociety, Mr. Hundert is a teacher of the humanities, specificallythe civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome.  Like the olderpeople in all of Ethan Canin's tales from the book ""The Palacethief,"" he appears at the beginning of the story, graying hair andglasses, looking back over his life and wondering just how muchimpact he made during his career.  His major disappointment is inhis shaping of the character of Sedgewick Bell, though in thepicture's major surprise we find out just why Hundert considershimself a failure in that one case to be a sad one.     There are several flaws in Hundert's teaching methodology.  Hetells the politician father of the troublesome lad that the purpose oflearning classic civilizations is to give the boys role models,people who have contributed greatly to their societies.  Yet fromwhat we see of his classroom questioning, he attempts to elicitmerely short answers from the kids giving us the impression thatwhat's really important to this academy is a knowledge of namesand dates.  Hundert makes a big deal of an annual contest towhich parents and the rest of the school are invited to name Mr.Julius Caesar, the three students who, having passed a series ofquizzes, are given the stage and asked a series of increasinglydifficult questions.  Here again, the questions demand mere shortanswers, demonstrating no knowledge of what made these peoplerole models.  While the classroom abounds in statuettes andpaintings The Trial of Socrates, a bust of Plato and another ofSocrates there are no discussion of what lies behind each ofthese works of art.  When Hundert is passed over for the job ofheadmaster when the current holder of that office (EdwardHerrmann) dies, he tenders his resignation, notwithstanding theapt counsel of the school's directors that Hundert is a teacher andwould not make a good fund-raiser.  And when Hundert states thatleaders who merely pillaged but contributed nothing to theirsocieties are forgotten, I expected Attila the Hun and GenghizKhan to rise up from their graves and file rebuttals.     ""The Emperor's Club"" is a surprising find in yet another seasonof cynicism, featuring anarchic blockbuster movies like ""XXX,""sado-masochistic works like ""Secretary,"" and mindless comedieslike ""Who is Cletis Tout.""  Though generally as sentimental asSam Wood's 1939 ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" which garnered anOscar for Robert Donat in his portrayal of a shy schoolteacherwho devotes his life to ""the boys"" the ironic conclusion saves""The Emperor's Club"" from mawkishness.  Whatever you think ofNeil Tokin's adaptation of Canin's fiction, you'll marvel at KevinKline's performance. ","Emperor's Club, The",PG-13,2002,3
292,"What would you rather be: an ordinary guy, maybe ashopkeeper but with a beautiful woman who loves you, or amajor player on the world scene, possibly with women chasingafter you but none who really connect with you?  In ""TheEmperor's New Clothes,"" Alan Taylor's imaginative retelling ofthe days of Napoleon after his defeat at Waterloo, the 5'6"" heroof France trades places with a drunken commoner in asuccessful escape from the island of St. Helena where he isguarded by a small company of British troops.  His plan is toland in Paris and yet again rally the tricolor in an attempt torestore the French Empire in Europe.  Plans go awry, butperhaps the best known figure of the Bonaparte clan gets morethan he ever hoped for when he finds the woman of his dreams.     Backed with a spirited soundtrack by Rachel Portman andphotographed on the island of Malta with scenes from the notedCinecitta studio, ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" lets fantasy fly ina trading-places parody in which one man goes from rags toriches while another tumbles the opposite way.  How the realNapoleon (who in this fable does not die of a stomach diseasein 1821) ultimately relinquishes all hope for a resurgence ofnationalism and is all the happier for doing so, is the subject ofthe movie which is taken from Simon Leys novel ""The Death ofNapoleon.""     NYU Film School graduate Alan Taylor, whose first feature,""Palookaville,"" is a whimsical look at three friends and theirforay into petty crime, scores once again the second timearound with a stab at historical revisionism.  Napoleon (IanHolm) stands about on a rock in St. Helena overlooking crystalclear water but in no way shares the ecstasy of the tourist. Determined to escape from the troops in his airy prison, he setsup a double (played as well by Ian Holm), a fellow by the nameof Eugene who has to learn to walk and talk in an imperial wayto convince the guards that he is in fact the emperor.  WhileNapoleon makes his way via Belgium to Paris, he meets thelovely, newly widowed Pumpkin (Dutch actress Iben Hjejle) andher son Gerard (Tom Watson).  Though the impoverished sellerof melons, Pumpkin, is pursued by Dr. Lambert (TimMcInnerny), she is smitten by the short man whom she acceptsas eccentric.  The only troops that Napoleon succeeds inrousing are the neighborhood fruit vendors, with whom heestablishes an intricate plan of action to triple their business.As his grandiose plan falls apart, Taylor milks the principalcomic action from Eugene's refusal to turn himself in as animposter, now insisting that he is actually the emperor andenjoying his about face from a man with a mop to the exiledleader of France.     ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" is in no way the sort of comedythat Moliere would write.  The film's joy comes from its quiethumor, its moments of realistic romance and poignantdisappointments, its affirmation of the gratifications ofserendipitous developments.  Napoleon may have found a wifein  Josephine, but to his wholly unexpected surprise he finds  authentic love in his declining year that of an ordinary humanbeing for another.. ","Emperor's New Clothes, The",PG,2002,3
293,"  If Walt Disney were to wander into the multiplex tonight,he'd wonder which studio did this animated film. Unlike what's come tobe known as the Mouse House formula (or rut, depending on your pointof view), there's only one or two songs and no romantic subplot. Thestory begins with a lonely, braying llama being drenched by rain inPeru. Only he's not an ordinary llama. He's actually Kuzco (voiced byDavid Spade), once the ruler of a pre-Colombian empire, who wasaccidentally transformed by his scheming, malevolent advisor Yzma(growling Eartha Kitt). Her dim-witted, muscular assistant, Kronk(Patrick Warburton), was supposed to kill him. Instead, he escaped inthe back of a cart belonging to Pacha, a good-natured, hulking peasant(John Goodman), his pregnant wife Chica (Wendy Malick) and fivedaughters whose village Kuzco had intended to raze to build a vacationresort. The adventure revolves around the emotional maturation of thenot-quite-18 year-old selfish, sarcastic, obnoxious Kuzco as he triesto find an antidote for the llama spell and hoofs his way back to thepalace with Pacha to claim his rightful throne. Written by DavidReynolds from a story by Chris Williams and director Mark Dindal, it'sbasically a buddy comedy and the quips are jazzy and hip, like ""Yourdepartment is being downsized"" and ""We're not picking up your option.""Reportedly, Sting and David Hartley composed a full musical score butwhat remains is ""Perfect World,"" sung by Tom Jones, and ""My FunnyFriend and Me.""

294,"Have you ever been invited to a party but were reluctant to go?  Maybe youdidn't know anybody who'd be there, or perhaps you thought you'd be out of placeamong people who were richer, more sophisticated, more knowledgeable.  Have youever then overcome your hesitation, headed for the affair, and then werepleasantly surprised by the people you met who were friendly and who took youinto their confidence?  This is the motivating factor behind Franc. Reyescompelling gangster movie, ""Empire,"" which according to production notes is thefirst of the genre to be told from the Latino point of view, written anddirected by a Latino.  Borrowing the concept of family from ""The Soprano"" andsome of the shootouts from the ""Godfather"" series, ""Empire"" scores because ofthe great appeal of John Leguizamo, a versatile individual known for suchdiverse roles as that of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec in Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge""and a hairdresser in Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam,"" familiar as well to the NewYork theater crowd for his one-man comic performances in ""Mambo Mouth"" and""Spic-O-Rama.""     Leguizamo performs in the role of Victor Rosa, a young, good-looking fellowof Puerto Rican extraction who lives in the South Bronx and makes a spectacularliving dealing heroin which, he proudly tells us, is the best stuff out there,never overly diluted like the junk that his competitors are dishing out. Criminal activity aside, he enjoys a warm relationship with his loyal pals,especially Jimmy (Vincent Laresca) and his live-in girl friend Carmen (DelilahCotto) whom he adores and wraps in expensive jewelry to the consternation of thegirl's mother, Iris (Sonia Braga).Believing himself too hip to be taken in by con artists like 3-card monteplayers, he winds up ripped off for quite a bit more because of his desire toleave the drugs behind and make a legitimate life for himself, his girl, and hisforthcoming son.     Throughout the story, Victor is contrasted with the fellow he meets at aparty, Jack Wimmer (Peter Sarsgaard), who wins his confidence by flattery and bya show of worldly success including his trophy girl friend Trish (DeniseRichards), a smashing Soho loft which he allows his new pal to use rent-free,and his apparent knowledge of Wall Street investments.     Some of the tidbits that come out in director Franc. Reyes' script arenothing we haven't heard before, but spoken in Jack Wimmer's unctuous style, youcan't blame some people in the movie audience who'd like to invest with him,research be damned.  As we know from the ""Godfather"" series, there is a beliefamong some in the organized crime business that their dealings are just anotherway of making money and that they are no more dishonest than corporateexecutives.  As Jack tells Victor, pointing out some of his tuxedo-cladcustomers at the posh party, cutthroat competition is the name of the game inevery field (including the media), and that what Victor does is no morereprehensible than actions we'd expect from chief executives of the big tobaccocompanies.  When Jack points out as well that half the people at the gatheringare his customers and that he is trying to win the business of the other half,we're certain that Victor is comparing Jack's life to his own, that of a man whomust fight to maintain his South Bronx turf from inroads that thugs from anothergang might make.  While Victor is eager to reinvent himself by fitting in with awhite-dominated establishment, his girl friend is more realistic, homesick forher life with mom despite the trapping of new money.     ""Empire"" is the first production of Arenas Entertainment, a division ofUniversal Pictures with a primary audience expected to be Latinos.  This is afortuitous debut not because there's anything new about the script of especiallynoteworthy about Ruben Blades' music or even about the concept of several worldsexisting in New York City with little knowledge of one another and even lessdesire of people to change their cultural values.  Nor is the all-too-frequentvoice over narration by Mr. Leguizamo appealing, as if writer-director Reyesfears that his audience may not follow the plot without that literary intrusion. ""Empire"" is, however, valuable because of Leguizamo's ability convincingly toshow those of us who live in the 'burbs, or in the so-called nice neighborhoodsof the city what life is like in the urban jungle, where heavy risk-taking incriminal activities appears the only way to climb out of poverty. ",Empire,R,2002,2
295,"Since teenagers form the most crucial segment of American movie-going public, it is quite understandable why Hollywood tries to adapt its products to their tastes or current cultural trends. But sometimes it tries too hard and the results are often disappointing. One of such examples is EMPIRE RECORDS, 1995 teen comedy directed by Allan Moyle.  The plot takes place in ""Empire Records"", small music store in Delaware, and follows 24 hours in lives of its employees, all of them being teenagers. The only adult is Joe (played by Anthony La Paglia), manager who tries to be fatherly figure to its subordinates, which results in young people doing anything but their job. Because of that ""Empire Records"" has in financial trouble and there is talk of being taken over by faceless music chain that enforces dress code and other business practices too oppressive for young Gen Xers. Lucas (played by Rory Cochrane), one of the employees, has tried to stop the inevitable by stealing the money from the cash register and trying to multiply it in Atlantic City. He lost it all, but Joe has more pressing matters at hand because the store is about to be visited by pop star Rex Manning (played by Maxwell Caulfield). In the meantime the employees are dealing with some of their own issues - love, sex, rock music ambitions, attempted suicides etc.  At first glance, EMPIRE RECORDS had all the ingredients of successful youth-oriented film - screenplay with anti-establishment attitudes and pandering to the Generation X sentiments, cool soundtrack, plenty of young and good-looking actors and, last but not least, direction of Allan Moyle, filmmaker who had made PUMP UP THE VOLUME, very successful youth-oriented movie. However, all those elements are fused together in such manner than they leave impression of artificiality. No matter how ""cool"" the characters might be, few teenagers would take them seriously. Screenplay by Carol Haikkinen doesn't help either, because the events in film have little of no resemblance to real life, and some of them are too repetitive. When the ""Empire Records"" break into song and dance for the first time, it is somewhat funny; the next time it is dull. On the other hand, some of young actors have done rather decent job, especially Rory Cochrane in the role of Lucas and Robin Tunney who is almost unrecognisable with her shaved head. Two actresses that had more stellar career in future - Renee Zelwegger and Liv Tyler - didn't leave particularly good impression. All in all, EMPIRE RECORDS tried to capture the spirit of its time, but it only managed to capture the way Hollywood executives had understood this spirit. ",Empire Records,PG-13,1995,1
296,"      THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the first sequel to STAR WARS, butusing a bit of revisionist history, George Lucas renumbered it to bethe fifth in the series and STAR WARS to be the fourth.  A moreintriguing marketing gimmick I have never seen.  For my money, nothinglike STAR WARS could be as good, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK iscertainly excellent with some characters stronger and one weaker thanthe first, but the script is as impressive and innovative as ever.Over 15 years after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was released, I got to seeit anew with my seven year old son Jeffrey.       Basically the plot of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is that the rebelsare continuing to fight the Empire.  Darth Vader (David Prowse actingwith voice by James Earl Jones) leads a mission to destroy the rebels'base on Hoth where our old rebel friends Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill),Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca""Chewy"" (Peter Mayhew), C3PO (Anthony Daniels), and R2D2 (Kenny Baker)are.  In a vision Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) tells Luke to go to Dagobahto train under the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz).       The movie is an adventure and a comedy like STAR WARS, but THEEMPIRE STRIKES BACK's main theme is the duality of The Force and thestruggle between good and evil as manifested in Luke and Darth Vader.Vader reveals a big secret in the show, which was a shock back then.Although everyone probably knows it by now, I will not repeat it lestone of the few people to have never seen the movie may be reading thisreview.       One of the parts of this episode that I was particularly fond ofthe way is that the romantic aspect is more fully developed.  There isa genuine chemistry between Han and Leia that starts off as verbalsparring, such as when Han sarcastically says, ""Fraid I'd leave withoutgiving you a good-bye kiss?""  Leia turns up her nose and says, ""I justas soon kiss a Wooky!""  Eventually the ripostes stop, and theirrelationship evolves into genuine and explicitly proclaimed love.  Mygod, they even have three brief mouth-to-mouth kisses!       Ford was immature, but hilarious in the original.  In this episodehe isn't quite as funny, but his character is much more central to theplot.  To me this was Ford's movie even if it appeared to be Luke'sstory.  Overall, I liked Ford just as much as before, but Fisherbetter.  She warmed up to the part more and was given a moresubstantial role.       Whereas George Lucas was STAR WARS, having directed and wrote it,in this episode he was only listed as the executive producer and wascredited with the story idea, but not the script itself.  The directorthis time was Irvin Kershner and the script was by Leigh Brackett andthe great screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan (WYATT EARP, THE BODYGUARD,GRAND CANYON, THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, THE BIG CHILL, BODY HEAT, andRAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK).       The script again is imaginative and full of laughs.  Poor Chewyremains the brunt of the many of the jokes.  When Chewy startsguffawing, Han tells him, ""Laugh it up fuzzball!""       Yoda provided the figure that was the fountainhead of wisdom muchas Obi-Wan did in the original.  Yoda plays his role like some good oldboy Ph. D. from the south.  He looks and sounds like a yokel who knowsnothing, but actually possesses almost infinite knowledge.  He tellsLuke, who doesn't know he is Yoda, ""Looking for someone?  Found someoneI'd say.""  When Luke is having trouble moving rocks by using The Force,Yoda tells him, he can do it.  Luke responds, ""Okay, I'll try.""  Yodagets angry with his pupil and admonishes him, ""No, try not.  Do or donot.  There is no try.""       C3PO still gets some of the best lines.  When the going getstough, C3 would just as soon give up.  When in a jam, he suggests tohis companions, ""Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative insuch situations.""  He tells R2D2 what computer veterans know, ""R2D2 youknow better than to trust a strange computer.""       The visual special effects (Richard Edlund and Brian Johnson) areeven more imaginative than last time.  As just an example, consider theImperial Walkers.  They are essentially 10 story tall, mechanical, fourlegged dinosaurs with human operators and laser cannons in the headportion.  The design makes absolutely no sense, but creates a greatvisual.  The way they lumber along is the piece de resistance.Watching them was actually my favorite part of the film.  My son, Ishould point out, does a great Imperial Walker imitation.       The kids learn creativity when they watch any of the STAR WARSepisodes.  Consider in this one the dilemma of how to stop these hugeImperial Walkers.  The answer?  Why spin a web like a spider from thefighters and lasso their legs cowboy style of course!  Actually, thereare a lot of parallels with cowboy shows and the STAR WARS movies.       I have a single, but significant criticism of this episode.Although I know they had to do it, I did not like the casting of MarkHamill to play Luke Skywalker again.  The other actors had matured andimproved, whereas Hamill seems to have gone downhill.  Missing was hisenthusiastic and fresh outlook.  In its place was someone who lookedconstantly haggard as if he were out drinking late every night beforethe morning shooting.  He was boyishly handsome in STAR WARS, but inthis episode, he had curiously seemed to have lost all of his goodlooks, and his energy level was too low.       THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK runs 2:04, and I think Paul Hirsch'sediting needed the tighter focus that STAR WARS had.  The film is ratedPG.  Again, the film is beautifully devoid of foul language.  Wouldthat modern screenwriters would realize that bad language shouldgenerally be saved for R rated films and above.  The story has cartoonlevel violence although there is one realistic, but not graphic pictureof a hand being cut off.  There is no sex, nudity, smoking or drug use.I think it would be fine for most kids over 4.  My son Jeffrey (age 7)loved it as did his Dad.  Even with my above noted one majorreservation, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK still gets my top recommendationand rating of ****. ","Empire Strikes Back, The",PG,1980,4
297," What a disappointment! Writer/director Neil Jordan, who gave usThe Crying Game, Mona Lisa, and In Company of Wolves, totally missesthe mark with this soggy romantic tale, grimly adapted from one ofGraham Greene's most autobiographical novels. Looking like a leftoverfrom the '50s, it's a staid, stodgy drama set during W.W.II, when theNazis were bombing London and adulterous couples carelessly cavortedin bed instead of seeking shelter during the air-raids. One suchcouple is Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore. He's a moody novelist,tortured by jealousy, and she's a troubled married woman, trapped bycircumstance in a dull, loveless marriage to a career civil servant,glumly played by Stephen Rea. They enjoyed many lusty encountersuntil, inexplicably, she broke off with him. The story explores howthat happened and why. It would be helpful if we cared but we don't,because neither character is even remotely interesting and, withoutrevealing too much, suffice it to say that the explanation revolvesaround Catholicism, the power of prayer, the existence of miracles,and the virtue of sacrifice. Julianne Moore spends considerable screentime cavorting naked, having shocked audiences with her full frontalnudity in Robert Altman's Short Cuts. She's actress who obviouslyenjoys anatomical revelation and seeks roles in which she can show herbody off.  Delicate, skinny Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand, sufferswhen his clothes are removed; plus, he seems totally self-absorbedwhich renders the love scenes lifeless, even depressing. This samestory was filmed unsuccessfully before in 1955 with Deborah Kerr, VanJohnson, and John Mills. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""TheEnd of the Affair"" is a plodding, dreary 4. It's a murky, misguidedmelodrama. ",End of the Affair,R,1999,2
298," Well, with ""Enemy of the State,"" the new Jerry Bruckheimer-produced and Tony Scott-directed action picture, two things are certain: this film is five times better than Bruckheimer's previous embarrassment, ""Armageddon,"" and Scott is a much better director than ""Armageddon"" alumni, Michael Bay. Of course, that isn't to say that, ""Enemy of the State,"" is actually good. It's just saying that it isn't terrible.  In a refreshing change of pace from usually playing a comedic role, Will Smith stars as Robert Dean, a high-pofile lawyer with a loving wife (Regina King) and young son (Jascha Washington) living in Georgetown, Maryland, who finds his pleasant life quickly start to crumble around him. While in a lingerie store buying something for his wife for Christmas, a former college friend (Jason Lee) of his bursts in, tries to tell him something, and then while Robert isn't looking, drops a piece of incriminating evidence into his shopping bag that is proof that the National Security Agency murdered a congressman (Jason Robards, who appears unbilled) for opposing a Telecommunications Security and Privacy Act. Immediately afterwards, the friend is hit by a truck and killed while being chased by the NSA. After Robert is linked to the tape that shows the murder, his clothes unknowingly are bugged, and he must leave his wife and go on the run, even though he does not know what they want, at first.  The premise of, ""Enemy of the State,"" is a complex one, to be sure, as it also includes a subplot involving Robert and his former girlfriend (Lisa Bonet), which I personally found more interesting than the central storyline. For the first hour, I was intrigued by, ""Enemy of the State,"" and surprised that it wasn't simply a non-stop action movie without any character development. The setup for the film was entertaining and clever enough, and I liked the relationship set up between Smith and Regina King, who is a criminally underrated actress. Meanwhile, Smith and Bonet, who I was happy to see again after her absence since the cancellation of, ""The Cosby Show,"" had a few nice scenes together. And Smith himself, was surprisingly appealing. It is good to see him try a more dramatic, challenging role, so he is one step in the right direction to being a true breakthrough film star. Gene Hackman has a supporting role as Brill, a former agency operative who has been in hiding since 1980, who tries to help Robert, but makes very little impact.  Unfortunately, the main story, although somewhat thought-provoking when dealing with the idea that there is so much high-tech spying equipment and cameras nowadays that, for all we know, we might be being watched non-stop, the conventional action stuff comes into full-blast in the second hour, and to me, it took on a definite ""been-there-done-that"" feeling. This sort of conventional chase picture has been done to death, and I think the filmmakers could have thought of something a little more original than ending it with a boring shoot-out sequence. It also didn't help that the movie could have easily been shortened by at least fifteen minutes.  What it all comes down to is that, ""Enemy of the State,"" is a step up for Bruckheimer, but is still not very successful, as it still has many of his trademarks: a frenetic pace, odd camera angles, and a bunch of supporting characters who are only there to sit in chairs and read things from monitors. ""Enemy of the State,"" is a sure sign that Bruckheimer might one day be able to make a really good film. That is, if he learns to focus more on the story, rather than a bunch of explosions.  ",Enemy of the State,R,1998,2.5

Asked by hostage-holdingrobbers at a liquor store for a car with a police radio, he generouslyvolunteers his own squad car.  With pedal to the metal, he delivers the carright through the store's plate glass window and begins blasting away whenhe gets inside.  Before the crooks know what hit them, he starts taking themout.  Rather than getting a medal, which he doesn't want, Harry gets bustedto a desk job, which he certainly doesn't want, for his antics at the liquorstore. THE ENFORCER, the third of the five Dirty Harry movies, is being re-releasedon DVD with a new digital transfer in celebration of the thirtiethanniversary of the start of the series. Harry has a reverse Midas touch when it comes to partners.  Being assignedto Harry is like having your doctor declare that you only have a few daysleft to live.  After the death of one partner in THE ENFORCER, Harry gets asecond one, Kate Moore (Tyne Daly, ""Cagney & Lacey""), a woman whose decadelong entire police career has been spent in the Human Resources department.No supporter of Affirmative Action, Harry does a slow boil when he is toldthat she will be his new sidekick.   ""[If] she wants to play lumberjack, she's going to have to learn to handleher end of the log,"" Harry tells his boss when he suggests that Harry goeasy on Kate on her difficult first day.  With her suit and high heels, shehas trouble chasing suspects.  She, of course, proves to be resilient andresourceful and becomes Harry's friend.  Daly gives an endearing performancethat could easily have been little more buffoonery. The plot this time has the People's Revolutionary Strike Force stealingexplosive devices and rocket launchers.  After they're armed to the teeth,they kidnap the mayor and demand a ransom. Dirty Harry movies are like James Bond pictures, except in Dirty Harry theyshow some actual nudity and the bullet holes come with blood.  This time thescene of gratuitous full-frontal nudity occurs when Harry accidentally drops-- and I do ""drops"" -- in on a porn movie set.  Bond, of course, always winson gadgets.  All Harry has is his big gun. The best part of the Dirty Harry movies is Harry's signature sarcasm.  Thistime the best line comes when Harry's superior suspends him forinsubordination and demands his badge.  ""Here's a seven point suppository,""Harry says with a glare that could kill as he turns over his star. THE ENFORCER runs 1:36.  It is rated R for violence, nudity and language andwould be acceptable for teenagers. My son Jeffrey, age 12, liked the movie, especially the new female partner,and gave it ** 1/2.

300,"In 1990s ""Miramax"" reinvented itself - at first it was known as the champion of American independent cinema. These days it is best known as the ""Oscar"" machine - studio that makes expensive, pretentious movies clearly designed for the single purpose of gaining as much of Academy Awards as possible. In past few years ""Miramax"" was quite successful in doing that, and one of the more spectacular coups was THE ENGLISH PATIENT, 1996 epic melodrama written and directed by Anthony Minghella.  Success of THE ENGLISH PATIENT can be partially explained by the plot that combines elements of two beloved ""Oscar"" winners of the past - CASABLANCA and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. Another reason is the script's literary basis in the form of prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje. The film begins in North Africa during WW2. British biplane is shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery and its badly burned pilot (played by Ralph Fiennes) gets rescued by Arab nomads. At the end of 1944 in Italy he finds himself in Italy as a patient in Canadian military hospital, unable or unwilling to declare his identity. Hanna (played by Juliette Binoche) is a Canadian nurse who gets intrigued by a mysterious disfigured man. Knowing that his life is about to end, she leaves her post and brings ""English Patient"" to an abandoned monastery in order to care for him in his last days. There she gets visited by Kip (played by Naveen Andrews), Sikh bomb disposal expert within British Army, and Caravaggio (played by Willem Dafoe), mysterious character who thinks he knows something about true identity of ""English Patient"". In the meantime, the ""English Patient"" remembers late 1930s when he used to be Count Almassy, Hungarian explorer accompanying British expedition mapping the Saharan desert. There he befriended Geoffrey Clifton (played by Colin Firth) and later began torrid extramarital affair with Geoffrey's wife Katherine (played by Kristen Scott-Thomas).  All those who sit through 162 minutes of THE ENGLISH PATIENT are going to be awarded by John Seale's beautiful cinematography, couple of incredibly effective shots of desert, splendid costumes and powerful and very credible performance by Kristen Scott-Thomas (and the acting talent is not the only thing Thomas reveals in this film). Unfortunately, all of the above represents the only reason why would anyone have to endure this film. The narrative structure that melts the past with the present was unfortunate - the ""past"" North African segment, full of adventure and exotic surroundings is much more interesting than Italian ""present"" with its pedestrian events and the boring and completely unnecessary love affair between Hanna and Kip. Even more problematic is the lack of likeable characters in the film - all the visual splendour and ""romantic"" atmosphere can't hide the fact that the audience must root for women who cheat on their husbands, aristocrats who collaborate with Nazis and nurses who desert their posts and abandon their wounded comrades. To make matters worse, some of the characters and subplots aren't explored enough, leaving impression of THE ENGLISH PATIENT as unfinished film. WW2 buffs among the audience would have to suffer another Hollywood travesty in the form of German paratroopers landing in Tobruq 1942 - scene that looks great but has little do with historic reality.  The acting also leaves much to be desired - with exception of Scott-Thomas, everyone in the film has made rather bland performance. And that includes even Juliette Binoche, despite her ""Oscar"". In short, THE ENGLISH PATIENT represents one of many recent Hollywood products that gave ""Oscar"" such a bad name. ","English Patient, The",R,1996,3
301,"      THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL, BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN is oneof those terminally cute, quirky British comedies.  It is a moviepopulated with sweet, non-offensive characters.  It is told as if itwere a true story and yet the tone of the film is that of an Aesopfable.  It is the sort of show that will undoubtedly work its charm onmany of you.       Although the movie is billed as the latest Hugh Grant flick, it isan ensemble cast.  Grant plays Reginald Anson who, with his coworkerGeorge Garrad (Ian McNeice), are English cartographers.  They have beenassigned by their government in 1917 to determine the exact height ofthe ""first mountain in Wales"".  This first mountain is the one justover the Welsh border in Ffynnon Garw.       The townsfolk of Ffynnon Garw are proud of their mountain, but tobe a government certified mountain, it must be at least 1,000 feettall.  The locals led by the local publican, Morgan the Goat (ColmMeaney), are aghast when Garrad and Anson declare their mountain to bejust shy of 1,000 feet and hence must forever after must be known asmerely a hill.  Morgan enlists everyone, even his nemesis, the localpreacher, Reverend Jones (Kenneth Griffith), and his favorite of hismany girlfriends, Betty (Tara Fitzgerald), to implement his scheme tofix the problem.  The movie is about the fix.       The story is predictable which is probably okay since it is afable and not a mystery.  The characters are all played with great andconsistent gusto by all of the cast.  My favorite was Tara Fitzgerald(from A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE, SIRENS, HEAR MY SONG, ""Cadfael"" (TV), and""Fall from Grace"" (TV)) who continues to impress me in how she can makea minor character so compelling.  All she needs do is give herinfectious smile at the right time and the screen lights up.  HughGrant (so wonderful in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and SIRENS amongothers) gave a nice performance, but not his best.       The director (Christopher Monger) was in complete control andcrafted a movie clearly reflecting what he had to set out to do.  It ishis goal and the script he wrote that was my problem with the picture.For me the characters, while cute, were not credible enough to bebelievable nor humorous enough to be funny.  To me it was an attempt atdroll humor that failed.  I almost felt guilty about not caring morefor a sweet little movie with carefully drawn characters, effectivecinematography (Vernon Layton), and dramatic music (Stephen Endelman).I found the slow pacing by the editor (David Martin) and the low keytone of the dialog boring and even sleep inducing at points. ","Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, The",PG,1995,2
302,"A world of similar films may be enough for most directors butnot for Michael Apted whose range includes original, significantdocumentaries like ""7-Up"" (the lives and aspirations of seven-year-old children, continued as those very children reach theages of 14, 212, 28 and 35), a critical and popular success,""The Coal Miner's Daughter"" (exploring the life of country singerLaura Lynn), ""Gorillas in the Mist"" (about ape researcher DianFossey) and then, less than three years ago, a James Bondthriller, ""The World is Not Enough.""  Defying the expectations ofmovie fans that his look into British code-breaking during WorldWar II would be a knock-down, drag-out action pic given therecent explosion of Second World War blockbusters, his""Enigma"" is a thinking person's spy story with most of the actionoccurring internally and the few scenes of vigorous goings-onsuch as the inevitable car chase, the leap from trains, and theexplosion that knocks out a submarine almost a disappointingchange from mental activity.  Though there are not the usualblind alleys in this spy story, there's a couple of neat twists, butgenerally ""Enigma"" is to a great extent what spying and code-breaking are all about: lots of perspiration with just a smidgen ortwo of daredevil antics.  Even the romance is realistic.     Using British actors, some of whom are scarcely known to themainstream American movie audience, Apted with a big boostfrom Tom Stoppard's intricate and complex dialogue takes usinto the Bletchley Park of 1943, sixty miles north of London, abuilding that houses men and women intent on intercepting andbreaking German codes.  While an Allied merchant shippingconvoy laden with supplies for Britain is crossing the Atlanticwith ten thousand passengers, a swarm of German U-boats isbeeping instructions, one to the others, about the location of themerchant vessels which are now in imminent danger.       Ordinarily, the British cloak-and-dagger people would havebroken the code to determine the location of the subs, but theenemy has ascertained that its code had been broken and haschanged the cryptograms to the frustration of the English.  Thequestion is: who leaked this secret military information to theNazis?  Just about anyone at Bletchley Park could be a suspectin the mind of secret service agent Wigram (the predictablydapper and witty Jeremy Northam), but Wigram has honed inthe brilliant mathematician Tom Jericho (Dougray Scott), who hesuspects has revealed the information foolishly to a Bletchleyagent who had caught his fancy, Claire Romilly (SaffronBurrows).  Working with Claire's roommate, Hester Wallace(Kate Winslet), Dougray determines to stay a few steps aheadof the pursuing Wigram while attempting to crack the newGerman code and discover the whereabouts of the missingClaire now suspected of treason.     Ireland's distinguished critic, Harvey O'Brien, has stated that""Enigma"" is the sort of movie that may appeal to an olderaudience, the young 'uns presumably unable to tolerate the lackof an MTV-like pace and explosions.  Blockbusters havebecome a familiar landscape with films like ""We Were Soldiers""and the upcoming ""Windtalkers"" and I believe Dr. O'Brien is onto something, but what a pity.  Yet while  ""Enigma"" could havebeen a plodding docu-drama like Attenborough's ""Gandhi,"" Apted wisely chooses to inject considerable romance into thestory to catch our fancy.  Tom Jericho has become obsessedwith the seductive and beautiful Claire and may have givenaway valuable information to this mysterious woman, while hetakes notice, albeit more slowly, of the superior charms of themore intelligent but mousy-looking Hester.  The chemistrybetween Scott and Winslet is not as palpable as the kind thetypical American movie audience expects, but is more realisticand is portrayed with real class amid a well crafted film thatbenefits much from John Barry's hypnotic but unobtrusive musicand photographed handsomely by Seamus McGarvey in the UK(including Scotland) and the Netherlands.  As an added benefit,""Enigma"" puts the credit for the codebreaking operationscorrectly with the British and not with the Americans (asexpressed in the film ""U-571"").  The acting is first rate, fromJeremy Northam's schtick as the confident, debonair secretagent to Kate Winslet's successful attempt to do theimpossible to appear unglamorous.  Dougray Scott illustrateswhat is probably the typical way a person may react whilerecovering from nervous exhaustion. All in all, an intelligentpiece of work with believable (rather than over-the-top) romanceand a credible look at some of the unsung heroes of World WarII. ",Enigma,NR,2001,3

Bond's mission, this time, is to find the notoriousinternational terrorist (Robert Carlyle) responsible for the death ofa British oil tycoon in an explosion in M16 headquarters. Thisformidable villain has a bullet lodged in his brain, rendering himunable to feel pain. To track him down, Bond is assigned as abodyguard for the tycoon's beautiful daughter, Elektra (SophieMarceau), who is building an oil pipeline through some of the mostdangerous territory on the globe. And his only ally in remoteAzerbaijan and the Caspian Sea is a nuclear weapons expert,Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), whose name leads to one of thefunniest last lines of a movie in years. Suave Pierce Brosnan embodies007, delving into the emotional depth of his relationships, and DeniseRichards is amusingly absurd as a scantily clad rocketscientist.

304,"How is it that director Barry Levinson can make such lasting modernclassics as 1988's ""Rain Man"" and 1990's ""Avalon,"" and other successfulfeatures like 2001's ""Bandits,"" and then opt to tackle a project asinconsequential as ""Envy?"" With comic powerhouses like the recently oversaturated Ben Stiller (2004's ""Along Came Polly"") and invaluableJack Black (2003's ""School of Rock"") on board, ""Envy"" would seem destinedfor greatness, or at least a round of solid laughs. Save for thatrare funny moment that sneaks in, ""Envy"" is a comedy that wants tobe dark and scathing, but lacks the courage of its convictions. Itworks better as a comment on today's material-driven society, butnot enough to make its mostly agreeable 99 minutes worth sifting through. Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) are longtimebest friends whose tight-knit families, including wives Debbie (RachelWeisz) and Natalie (Amy Poehler), live across the street from eachother in a powerline-heavy neighborhood in the Valley. Working togetherat a sandpaper factory, Tim is happy with his working-class, familyman existence, while Nick is a dreamer constantly trying to concoctget-rich-quick schemes. When Nick hits the jackpot, so to speak, withan invention he calls ""Vapoorize,"" a spray that makes dog feces disappear,he is instantly made famous and rich. Because Tim had a chance tojoin him on the enterprise and passed, he grows increasingly jealousas he sees Nick build a mansion across the street and treat himselfto all of wealth's luxuries. And after a chance meeting with the mysteriousJ-Man (Christopher Walken) at a nearby watering hole, Tim decidesto take Nick and all of his success down. Written by Steve Adams, ""Envy"" wants to be a merciless dark comedyalong the lines of something Danny DeVito (1989's ""The War of theRoses,"" 2003's ""Duplex"") might make, or at least that is how it setsitself up, but then its searing vision recoils just as it should betaking off. Tim is overcome with jealousy for Nick's fabulous newlife, but the revenge he takes on him turns out to be accidental (hekills Nick's beloved pet horse with a bow and arrow) before evaporatingaltogether. The whole tone is like that, lackadaisical when it shouldbe ferocious, low-key when it should be wilder. Without much to laugh at (the poop-disappearing spray is as preposterousand lame as it seems), the film's most tantalizing aspect is its skewed,but honest study of the American Dream, and how all of the love inthe world is not quite enough to make you happy when you lack financialsecurity. Some people can deny this all they want with the whole ""moneycan't buy happiness"" claim, but they're lying to themselves. Besides,it isn't necessarily the money that Tim yearns, although he knowsit would be nice. Instead, he simply wishes for material equalitywith Nick, and it pains him to no end when that is taken away fromhim and Nick gets rich. It is a tricky subject, but director BarryLevinson pulls it off and makes it the film's sole rewarding element. Ben Stiller has been in no less than six films in the last year (hereally should work less), but his concentrated turn here as the enviousTim Dingman is one of his best recent performances. Without the broader,most outlandish character strokes of ""Starsky & Hutch,"" for example,Stiller finally has a palpably normal character to build and deepen,and he does it well. Jack Black is paid no such favors, and actuallyhas little of interest to do throughout. As their steadfast wives,Rachel Weisz (2003's ""Runaway Jury"") is playing below her abilities,and the wasted Amy Poehler is much more memorable in ""Mean Girls.""Christopher Walken (2004's ""Man on Fire""), however, is a standout,goofy and oddly likable as a troublesome stranger who decides to useTim for his own well-being. Despite not being the disaster many are calling it, it is easy tosee why ""Envy"" has been held from release for over a year (at onepoint, it was even rumored to be going direct-to-video). The film'spremise is not commercially viable, the comedy is limp, and with theend credits viewers are more likely to shrug and quietly exit thetheater rather than be roaring with laughter. Director Barry Levinsonhas something to say with ""Envy,"" but he forgets to let audiencesin on exactly what that something is. This is his most undernourishedfilm since 1994's ""Jimmy Hollywood,"" and if you can't remember thatdisposable Joe Pesci comedy, don't worry. Nobody does.",Envy,PG-13,2004,1.5
305,"If the U.S. pulled its troops out of Saudi Arabia, would bin Ladenand his cohorts be satisfied enough to stop their terroristsattacks?  Probably not.  Why not?  The attacks are motivatedonly partly by specific wrongs for which the fanatics blame theU.S.  The principal cause of the aggression is pure hatred againsta West that is far more prosperous and allows considerablefreedom to groups (such as women) that are kept down by someof the states that house the extremists.  Is there a way to ridourselves of these terrorist attacks without invading Iraq?  Surebut not practical.  You can inject all the people in the world daily with a drug that would turn them into virtual zombies (Librium, forexample, from which the title of this film may have been derived). Voila.  We're all devoid of emotions, the negative ones likejealousy, sorry and hatred and the positive ones like love andfriendship.  This is the principal concept of Kurt Wimmer'simaginative sci-fi thriller, ""Equilibrium,"" which despite  being aretread embodying tales like ""Fahrenheit 451"" (undergroundmovement retreats to memorize banned books), ""The Matrix""(videogame-like shoot-ups),  ""Village of the Damned"" (readingpeople's minds), ""Gattica"" (the search for the perfect humanbeing), ""1984"" (anti-sex league, Big Brother is watching) comesout of today's headlines, at a time that government officials arepondering what to do about enraged fanatics intent on destructionout of pure hatred for the enemy.    When Wimmer starts his film with portentous narration andpictures of Joe Stalin, Adolph Hitler and Saddam Hussein, we'reready to think that what the society known as Equilibrium hasdone to prevent war is utopian, and not, as production notes state,dystopian.  After all, what could be better than a world withoutwar?  The question is: are we willing to shed our emotions toreach that state, to become zombies whose only purpose is tofurther the interests of the state?     In the film, which stars Christian Bale as a top paramilitaryofficial Cleric John Preston who gets to kill far more people thandid the American psycho, a machine-gun-toting force looking likeclones of robocop keep perpetual vigil over the last enclave ofhuman beings left on earth following a nuclear World War III.  Toavoid World War IV, that is, a civil war in this case, everyone ismandated to inject himself daily with Prozium.  Prozium numbesall senses and people appear willing to subject themselves to thisritual because they heed the omniscient head cleric (AngusMacFadyen) who appears on the Imax screens all over the city.       Such a society is bound to fail, however, because some hardymen will remember how they feel in the presence of women (andvice versa) and form underground movements to topple the regimeeven though a new order could lead to war.  When Cleric JohnPreston, having accidentally dropped his dose of Prozium, isunable to get a new supply for a day, he runs into Mary O'Brien(Emily Watson), whom he arrests for ignoring the drug and livingwith perfume and music, and who challenges a way of life thatrequires a shucking off of all feeling.  Now, nobody can resistEmily Watson, drug or no drug, and pretty soon Prestonquestions his loyalty to the regime, a situation noticed by hisincreasingly suspicious partner, Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs).     What gives ""Equilibrium"" its power despite its recycling of oldthemes is incredible production values.  Filmed at State Universityof New York at Purchase and featuring ""Metropolis"" and ""DarkCity"" style architecture, ""Equilibrium"" enjoys momentousproduction values. Virtually every scene could be frozen andplaced in a museum of cinematically vivid shots.  Christian Bale ischarismatic, not only because of his slicked-back black hair hisserious demeanor but because we can actually believe he canmow down armies of loyal forces with just two huge guns, turningsomersaults like Keanu Reeves and proving himself the fastestgun in Purchase, New York.  Taye Diggs takes a break as theBuppie heartbreak kid to perform in the role of a man who letsnothing stand in his way of career advancement, certainly not hispartner who has gone astray.  And Emily Watson plays againsttype as a gamin who insists that life without feeling is utterlymeaningless.       When Austin Powers says, ""Oh behave,"" he never intended hisaudience to turn into zombies.  If drugging oneself silly is to bethe society of the future, who'd want to be part of it?  There's a plot hole that I could not resolve; how does the loyal character ofTaye Diggs become enraged at his partner and, what's more,fiercely ambitious to become the right-hand man of the Father ifhe's taking his Prozium?  In any case, videogame lovers, sci-fifans, cinema buffs who love action at a fierce pace should go forthe film, one which might even get them thinking about the kind ofpolitical setup they would have in their ideal society. ",Equilibrium,R,2002,3
306," You've just been erased. -John Kruger       Sometimes a critic falls in love with a show that is getting mixedreviews.  For me one of these is ERASER.  I went to it expecting anenjoyable Schwarzenegger action flick, but nothing special.  Once safelyensconced in my seat I was blown away by the movie.         Thanks to an excellent script by Tony Puryear and Walon Green, themovie is the funniest action picture this year.  Director Chuck Russell(THE MASK) is able to sustain a high energy pace that keeps the actionmoving and the audience's adrenaline pumping.  Too bad he was not thedirector of the too often tedious MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  Actually thereis a center part of ERASER that repeats part of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, butwith much more energetic timing.       First, a suggestion.  Go see this movie while it is still at thebiggest screen with the most powerful subwoofers.  The explosions andthe gun fire, especially the electromagnetic guns, produce a sound thathas the theater rocking.  Second, the setup for the plot is the usualimplausible one of the military, the intelligence community, the Mafia,big business, et. al. all involved in a vast conspiracy.  This time itis to buy and sell a new line of ultra powerful weapons.  Ignore thisconspiracy ridiculousness.  Go with the flow.       John Kruger (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a Federal Marshall that ispart of a special group in the witness protection program.  He eraseswitnesses by making them appear to have died.  He then hides them in aplace that only he knows about.  James Caan plays Robert Deguerin,Kruger's mentor, and James Coburn plays Beller, who is the head of theprogram.       Things get out of hand when Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams) reportsto the FBI about the aforementioned plot to sell weapons.  She is hunteddown and almost killed until Kruger saves her.  The picture is about thecat and mouse game as the bad guys try to kill her and get her computerdisk before she can testify.  The slight mystery is which guys are thegood ones and which the bad.  The ending of ERASER is great.  Moreover,as soon as you think it is over, it gets better and better.       The script is intelligent and at the same time so funny in partsthat I was constantly rolling with laugher.  As the lead evil characterputs it when asked about the morality of selling horrible weapons to thewrong side, ""Wars come and go.  The only difference is who gets rich andwho gets dead.  I prefer rich.""  When Kruger asks Father Rodriguezwhether it is safe to venture out, Father Rodriguez says, ""The streetsare clear.  The police have returned to the safety of their donutshops.""       The acting is quite good.  Arnold is in fine form and hilarious -as good as in TRUE LIES, which I loved.  Caan is given a one dimensionalcharacter but manages to make him interesting.  Coburn barely has a part- not enough to even comment on.  The best acting in the show is byVanessa Williams.  In the first scene she is so tense, you feel like youare going to have a heart attack.  Later in the show, her vulnerabilitydevelops into strength and bravery.  A complex role that she is up to. All of this notwithstanding, this is Arnold's picture, and he is great -strong and funny.       There are many terrific minor actors in the show, but the best arethe ones from the local mob-cum-union.  We have Robert Pastorelli asJohnny C. plus someone named Tony Two Toes and another named Mikey. They give invaluable help to Kruger and wonderful mirth to theaudience.  When Tony Two Toes first sees Kruger, he asks, ""Who's thetree trunk?""  When Tony thinks some Russians may be involved, heexclaims, ""Those dirty Commies!""  But, Mikey quickly corrects him with,""They're not commies any more.  They're a federation of independentliberated states.""  When someone gets in his way, Tony Two Toesthreatens them with, ""Nobody screws with the union.""       The stunts are spectacular throughout, but my favorites are thescene when Cullen's house is attacked and the scene on the airplane. Each is choreographed with perfect timing and fluid motions.  The scripttoo is highly imaginative from the guns used to the solutions Krugercomes up with on the airplane.  Finally, the film conclusively answersthe question, what do you say when you murder an alligator.       ERASER runs a fast 1:45 thanks to excellent editing by MichaelTronick.  The film is rated R.  There is no sex or nudity, and thelanguage is mild.  Since this is an action flick, there is violence withlots of people being killed and some blood, but overall, it is much lessgory than typical R rated action films - more like a shoot-'em-upWestern.  It is fine for teenagers, but not too much younger.  I sawsome Dads taking their 8-10 year olds into the film which I think is tooimmature an age for this much violence.  I give the film a strongrecommendation.  You will like the actions and the stunts and willprobably be rolling over with laughter too.  I give the film *** 1/2.",Eraser,R,1996,3
307,"Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman may be eccentric, but one cannot denythe joyful innovation and lovable quirkiness he brings to each ofhis projects, not the least of them being 1999's ""Being John Malkovich""and 2002's ""Adaptation"" (my pick for the best film of that year).Where Kaufman formulates his ideas may be one of cinema's most mystifyingquestions. A simple plot synopsis is nearly impossible, at the riskof coming up with a description that may confuse or turn off potentialviewers. To see Charlie Kaufman's scripts brought to filmic life isthe only way to truly understand Kaufman's oeuvre. They have a magicabout them, a style and warmth all their own, that jumps vibrantlyoff the page and comes together on celluloid with the seeming easeit might take to cobble together a formula picture. Only Kaufman'sfilms are anything but formulaic; he simply knows exactly what he'sdoing every step of the way. Directed by Michel Gondry (who previously adapted Kaufman's lesser-known2002 film, ""Human Nature""), ""Eternal Su nshine of the Spotless Mind""is a trippy, oddball journey that literally takes you through a person'smemories. It visualizes, quite successfully, the feeling of a dreamcome to life, while possessing the tone of a star-crossed love storybetween two people destined to be together. In no short order, theresults are genuinely romantic, nostalgic, funny, frightening, andultimately heartbreaking. Told primarily in reverse chronology, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) isdevastated when he goes to see the love of his life, Clementine (KateWinslet), only to discover that she has no idea who he is and alreadyhas a new boyfriend, Patrick (Elijah Wood). His investigation intowhat has happened leads him to a seedy company called Lacuna, headedby Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), that specializes in completelyerasing the memory of people from one's brain. Unable to think ofa life without Clementine, Joel decides to have the operation. From here, the film takes a turn toward a nearly constant dream-likestate, as Joel's relationship with Clementine is played in reversein his mind, each time culminating in her erasure from his memory.It is no secret that their relationship ended rockily, but as Joeltravels closer to the point where they met, he is faced with timesin his life with Clementine where he had never been happier and moreat peace. Making the decision too late that he doesn't want her wipedout of his life, Joel tries to find a way to bury Clementine in deep-seatedmemories where he hadn't yet known her, in a desperate bid to keepher with him. The very nature of one's memories, even the negativeones, after all, offer life experiences that mold you into who youare; they are personal, unpalatable things that shouldn't be traded for the world. At its core, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a mysticalmotion picture about the power of fate, and how if something is meantto happen, it will, no matter what. The love story between Joel andClementine remains lucid and true, capturing just right all of thelittle details about one's relationship with another that make itpersonal and unique. The way Joel and Clementine would burrow underneaththeir bed covers and bare their souls to each other. Or the way theywould watch drive-in movies without actually paying to go to the drive-in,creating their own dialogue between the characters they saw on thescreen while sitting in their car on the street. Or the way they likedto run on the beach after a fresh snowfall. Or the way they wouldlay down on iced-over ponds, gazing up at the constellations in thesky. Scenes like these, small and pure, are beautiful both in theirconception and execution. In one of his most dramatic roles yet, Jim Carrey (2003's ""Bruce Almighty"")proves why he is such a rare find„a talent who is not only enormouslyfunny, but can reel in his zaniness and cre ate a performance of astonishingrange and subtlety. Carrey's Joel believes himself to be boring, anddoesn't speak much because of it. Clementine is the exact opposite,a colorful young woman who changes her hair color practically everyweek and seems to talk a lot to hide her insecurities. Together, theymake the perfect match. Kate Winslet (2003's ""The Life of David Gale""),who is on a roll with her second modern-day part in a row after yearsof wearing nothing onscreen but a corset, is a joy to behold as Clementine.She is lovable without trying to be, funny without having to showoff, and masks a darker, more sorrowful side under a mostly positiveexterior. Carrey and Winslet exude just the right chemistry„a destinedconnection„to make the love story between them ring with emotion and vitality. In a supporting role that misleadingly appears to be a throwaway untila key story developmen t at the beginning of the third act gives hersudden importance and depth, Kirsten Dunst (2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"")is excellent as Lacuna receptionist Mary. Dunst is intentionally humorousand flighty at the onset, and unexpectedly touching near the end,a carefree girl who must reevaluate everything she thought she knewafter making a key discovery about herself. Rounding out the cast,Mark Ruffalo (2003's ""In the Cut"") and Elijah Wood (2003's ""The Lordof the Rings: The Return of the King"") are Lacuna assistants Stanand Patrick, the latter of whom secretly pines for Clementine, whilethe underrated gem that is Jane Adams (1998's ""Happiness"") warmlyplays Joel's tight-knit sister, Carrie. If ""Eternal Sunshin e of the Spotless Mind"" is boundlessly originaland fascinating, a film not quite like any other ever made, it nonethelesshas trouble reaching the lofty heights of either ""Being John Malkovich""or ""Adaptation."" All of the little moments from Joel and Clementine'srelationship are, indeed, on view, but too much seems to be missingfrom the trajectory of their faltering romance to give the viewerthe complete and full picture. Instead, we are forced to fill in theblanks ourselves, which works some of the time but is unsatisfyingat other points. The subplots involving Mary and the assistants, whichoccur parallel to Joel's memory travelogue, occasionally take theviewer out of what should be the sole focus. There is a purpose tothese real world interludes, but they still give the picture a certain unevenness. All of the plot elements arrive full circle in the finale, as Joeland Clementine must face the prospect of getting to know each othera second time with the knowledge of where things may once again lead.The notion of such is daunting and powerful, and the film strikesall of the right notes between bittersweet drama and weighty pathos.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" which gets its name fromone of the many quotes Mary likes to recite, is an unconventionaldelight. Problematic as some of its details may be, the core of thefilm is unfaltered with candid truthfulness and the nostalgia of memoriesthat make love worth fighting for.",Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,R,2004,3.5
308,"If you wandered into this movie ten minutes late withoutknowing a thing about it, you might swear it was either asequel to Tennessee Williams' ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" orAugust Wilson's ""The Piano Lesson Part II: the 1960s.""  Howsurprised you'd be to find out that this lyrical Southern Gothicfeast trimmed with the precise amount of mysticism andframed by some glorious photography of the primitive-lookingLouisiana swamps is a first-time directorial effort.  KasiLemmons, who wrote and directed ""Eve's Bayou,"" hasimmersed herself in the mind of a ten-year old girl named EveBatiste, through whose eyes this adult tale is seen.  This old-fashioned, multi-generational story which received a screeningat Colorado's Telluride Film Festival focuses on a prosperousBlack Louisiana family and is not only told from a woman'spoint of view: its entire vista unfolds as a story dominated byits women.  Yet its racial and gender crossover potential isgreat, given the solid, realistic acting of its well-known all-Black cast and the effective merging of voodoo, romance,cultural values, and panorama.  Perhaps ""Eve's Bayou"" isunderscored more by what it is not than by what it embraces. It is, happily enough, not another inner-city, macho 'hoodstory of drugs and gangster activity, nor is it yet another racialdiatribe or a feel-good buddy movie about Blacks and Whitesteaming up against real enemies.   Little Eve (played by the remarkably expressive, ten-year-old Jurnee Smollettt) begins her voiceover narration with apoetic statement that sets the tone for the movie: ""Memory isa selection of images, some elusive, others printed indeliblyon the brain.  The summer I killed my father, I was 10 yearsold.""  Put yourself in the place of this child, one who could beof any race, as she observes events surrounding the familymansion, and understand how she might overreact to someand, at other times, do what she can to save the integrity andeven the very lives of members of her household.  At a lavishparty given by her parents, her face turns enraged withjealousy as she observes her dad, Louis Batiste (Samuel L.Jackson), dancing with her 14-year-old sister Cisely (MeaganGood) while effectively ignoring her.  Moments later, asleep inthe barn which serves as a wine cellar, she awakens from adark corner only to notice her father engaged in sexualactivity with Matty Mereaux (Lisa Nicole Carson), who ismarried to a New Orleans teacher, Lenny (Roger GuenveurSmith).  Eagerly telling her sister what she has watched, sheis told to forget what she observed as she was mistaken: herfather was simply telling a joke and Matty was leaning intohim with laughter.   Much of ""Eve's Bayou"" deals with the thin line betweentruth and illusion, between reality and the arcane.  In thisregard Mozelle Batiste Delacroix (Debbi Morgan) becomes thestory's center.  Mozelle, who has psychic powers and hasbeen married three times to men who have all died as thoughafflicted with her curse, is able to hold her clients' palms andcapture images of people her patrons are anxious to find. Each of Mozelle's visions is effectively photographed assurreal, black-and-white images, in one case of the missingwife of a client who is in the arms of another man, in anothera young man in Detroit whom she sees shooting up drugs. So seriously does Mozelle's sister Cisely take her powers thatwhen Mozelle foresees a child struck fatally by a vehicle,Cisely refuses to allow her daughters to go outside.   Writer-director Kasi Lemmons affixes resonance to her storyby situating it in a historical context.  Some generations back,a slave named Eve saved the life of her master.  In return,she is given her freedom and presents her former owner withsixteen children.  These are some of the descendants of thatunion: the ten-year-old is named for that slave.   ""Eve's Bayou,"" then, represents some of the mostsignificant images affixed in the mind of its title character,understandably enough centering on moments of sexualityinvolving her dad.  At one point, a seminal event (so to speak)occurs in which her father either attempts to seduce hisfourteen-year-old daughter or, paradoxically enough, takesaggressive steps to stop the young woman from seducinghim.  Jurnee Smollett rivets as Eve with exceptionalperformances from Debbi Morgan as the clairvoyant Mozelleand, in a smaller role, the legendary Diahann Carroll as awitch-like competitor of Mozelle whose evil eye is blamed forthe movie's tragic end.",Eve's Bayou,R,1997,2
309,"If James Bond had a 9-year-old daughter named Jane and Janewere kidnaped to North Korea by an enemy agent, would 007resort to the World Court of the U.N. to get her back?  Yeah, right. But what would happen if James Bond were no longer 007 but justan ordinary, flawed citizen and parent from Ireland?  His daughteris not kidnaped but taken away from him according to the laws ofhis country, sent to an orphanage against her will.  What's a guylike that to do?  He could crash the orphanage and demand herreturn, and in fact that's exactly what he does. But he finds thatno man is above the law and is not only repulsed for his attempt,but in addition the Irish courts consider his rash albeit passionateaction to be a strike against him.  There's only one solution:petition the courts to get the little girl back.     We mention James Bond because Pierce Brosnan is theprincipal character in Bruce Beresford's new movie ""Evelyn,""penned by Paul Pender and based (now don't get scared away bythis) on a true story.  This really happened in the Emerald Isle in1953, made history, and shows that sometimes, however rarely,an ordinary David can take on a Goliath and, with determinationfueled by the holiday spirit can make enough of an impression onthe world to warrant a movie.     In this heartwarming holiday fare a movie that's not as witty orhip as Douglas McGrath's free adaptation of Charles Dickens's""Nicholas Nickleby"" Desmond Doyle (Pierce Brosnan) has themisfortune (or good luck depending on your interpretation) to losehis wife to another guy, who takes her away from the land ofleprechauns off to remote Australia.  No divorce, not even agoodbye to him or her daughter Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur) or hertwo sons.  Stuck with a hostile mother-in-law who insists that hedeserves what he got, Desmond's problems pile up when the statetakes the kids to orphanages run by the church, places that arehardly Dickensian and where kids seem to have a good deal of funbut, let's face it: a child wants to be with his own folks.  Aftergaining the interest of a solicitor, Michael (Stephen Rea) in hiscase and that of a barrister, Nick (Aidan Quinn), he takes hiscase to court with the moral backing of Bernadette (JuliannaMargulies) who is fond of him, and of legal consultant TomConnolly (Alan Bates) as well.     Using a good, solid, conventional story line without flashbacksor special effects or irrelevant soundtrack music, Beresfordillustrates a case that in Ireland seems to have garnered all theinterest and partisanship as did the Caine Mutiny court martial. The outcome of the case rests on a conflict between an Irishstatute that insists that a parent who abandons her family mustnonetheless consent to have his or her spouse take custody of aminor, and the constitution of Ireland which may or may notconflict with the statute.  This actual case turns out to be Ireland'sMarbury vs. Madison, involving the very first time in history that alaw's very constitutionality is challenged.     Pierce Brosnan, using his native Irish dialect, is a lot morevulnerable than Bond this time around, employing the depths of aman's courage in downing glass after glass of that awful, dark Irishale until he wises up and changes to lemonade.  As the titlecharacter, little Sophie Vavasseur resembles a young EmilyWatson and is as cute as Christmas, performing with a ShirleyTemple charm whether slapped by a vicious nun, surrounded bylawyers and an audience in a packed courtroom, or within theloving confines of her single-father home.  Only a scrooge of acritic could complain about the story's sentimentality, a writeruntouched by the rays of sunshine which to the little girl resemblea message from the angels. ",Evelyn,PG,2002,3
310,"      ""She had her moments,"" sings Che (Antonio Banderas) aboutlegendary figure Eva Peron (Madonna).  ""She had some style.""  Thisperfectly describes Madonna's performance as EVITA.  Madonna has ""some""style in the role, but not much.       Perhaps the problem is that Madonna's performance is all style.She mugs for the camera, but her acting is rarely convincing and hersongs are one disappointment after another.  To be fair, the score byAndrew Lloyd Webber has only one decent song.  He is no Rodgers andHammerstein replacement.  For the record, I happen to love musicals.  Ihave talked to critics who did not like EVITA, and the flames theyusually get claim the reason the critics did not like the film isbecause they really don't like musicals.       EVITA opens in a crowded movie theater in Buenos Aires.  The yearis 1952.  Someone stops the projector, and the cinema manager (GabrielKraisman) goes out to tell the booing crowd some tragic news, ""It is mysad duty to inform you that Eva Peron, spiritual leader of the nation,entered immortality this evening.""  This is followed by mass weeping.       The film then goes back in time to Evita's childhood.  The storytreats her as something between a saint and a demigod, and yet, sheremains as much an enigma when the movie is over as when it began.  Iguess she was a liberal because in her weekly radio program she ask heradmirers, ""Tired of a government that no longer gives us the things wedeserve?""  I also learned that the military did not like her, and thatis about it.       The cinematography by Darius Khondji is incredibly beautiful.  Heuses shadows and haze to film his subjects.  Everything is bathed inwarm earth tones.  You may have seen his work before in SEVEN, THE CITYOF LOST CHILDREN, and STEALING BEAUTY.  I predict he will get anAcademy Award nomination for EVITA.  The sets by Brian Morris(WUTHERING HEIGHTS and SABRINA) are also impressive.       The script is by Alan Parker and Oliver Stone and is based on theplay ""Evita"" with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Andrew Lloyd Webber.The script has almost every word sung, which might have worked withstronger singers and better songs.  It does work when they have musicalcrowd scenes of people marching with banners unfurled or tanks rollingand soldiers marching.  The chorus is good, but the individual singersare not.  Banderas has a rough singing voice, Madonna has a weak one,and Jonathan Pryce, as Juan Peron, has none at all.  Pryce gives up.His ""singing"" is more like hummed words.       For the first ten or fifteen minutes, the show concentrates on thecrowd scenes and the visuals.  At this point, the film was enjoyable.And then Madonna makes her entrance and the whole film startsimploding.       As I sat in the theater bored stiff with only the images toadmire, I kept thinking: Where is Oliver Stone when you need him?  Hewas originally slated to direct the film, but through a set ofcircumstances the director role was given over to Alan Parker.  Parkeris perhaps best known for MISSISSIPPI BURNING, but my favorite pictureof his was PINK FLOYD: THE WALL, which had all of the energy andsinging values that EVITA does not.  You can, however, see a similaritybetween the crowd scenes in EVITA and the classroom scenes in PINKFLOYD: THE WALL.  Still, Stone, as much as I have disparaged him insome of his work, might have been able to breathe some much needed lifeinto EVITA.       The scene I will always remember from the show is not one of theexcellent crowd sequences, but the first meeting of Eva and Juan.  Asthe actors sing each other's names, it is so false and so strangesounding musically, that I began to laugh out loud at them.       In mid-December when I was on my way to the press screening, mycar broke down on the highway.  My ever-reliable auto had not done thatin twelve years.  Maybe it was trying to tell me something.  Maybe Ishould have listened.       EVITA runs way too long at 2:14.  It is rated PG, but given thebloody images I was surprised it was not PG-13.  I think some kidsunder nine will be scared.  I can not recommend EVITA, but willgenerously give it ** for the stunning visuals.  If I could have turnedthe sound off, I would have liked it better. ",Evita,PG,1996,2.5
311,"      Heart attack city!  So, is your adrenaline a little low?  Sufferfrom low blood pressure?  Have I got a cure for you: EXECUTIVEDECISION.  Since Steven Seagal is on the marquee, you figure, hey, thishas got to be another Steven Seagal action film, right?  Wrong.  StevenSeagal has basically a cameo role and disappears early on, never to beseen again.  Moreover, you even guessed the wrong genre; this is athriller.  Although there is action, most of the movie's time andtension is spent in mental anguish with lots of sweaty brows as thetime for disaster approaches.  How will they figure a way to pull itout?       The show starts with an unsuccessful covert mission by Lt. Col.Austin Travis (Steven Seagal).  The research for the mission was doneat a comfortable desk back in Washington by David Grant, Ph. D. (KurtRussell) so Col. Travis and Dr. Grant dislike and distrust each otherfrom the beginning with each blaming the other for the failed mission.In the next scene, Dr. Grant gets a flying lesson in a small privateplane.  Just before he gets to fly solo for the first time, he iscalled back to his desk to learn about the failed mission.  Right thenand there, the whole audience knows the ending of the show, but itdoesn't matter because editor turned director Stuart Baird is so goodat keeping the tension mounting.       While Dr. Grant is in a very formal tuxedo at a government ball,he gets called to the Pentagon situation room.  It seems that the sameterrorist group has hijacked a 747 and plans to kill everyone on boardunless another terrorist is released from an American prison.  Up untilthen, it is the classic terrorist problem, but Dr. Grant deduces theterrorists have an extremely lethal nerve gas called DC-5 on board, andthey do not want to land in Washington, D. C., they want to killeveryone there with the gas by taking the plane on a kamikaze mission.       The only solution is to get on board the 747 in flight, defuse thebomb attached to the nerve gas, subdue the terrorists and land theplane.  The question is should the president make an executive decisioninstead to shoot down the plane and the 400 people on board before theterrorists get a chance to explode the nerve gas over land.  Dr. Grantsays the rescue mission is possible since he knows a nerdy engineernamed Cahill (Oliver Platt) who has devised a theoretical way to fly astealth fighter underneath another plane and link up without beingdetected.  Platt does all nerds proud and the classic little straw hesucks on turns out to be one of the heroes of the show.       Cahill, Dr. Grant, and a small, crack secret forces team headed byCol. Travis flies in the stealth fighter which links up with the 747.Most of the show happens after the army team plus Cahill and Dr. Grant,still in his Tux, boards the cargo hold of the 747.  I will not coverwhat happens next, but suffice it to say that your heart may try topound out of your chest as mine did.  I even found my body shaking someon the defusing the bomb scenes.  The soldier named Cappie tells theCahill while trying to defuse the bomb not to worry since, ""if youscrew up, you'll never know it.""       Beside what I believe is one of the best performances ever byRussell, many others are great too.  David Suchet from PBS's Perotseries, is excellent as the leader of the terrorists on the plane.Halle Barry plays a brave and resourceful airline stewardess.  JohnLeguizamo and B. D. Wong are good as some of the soldiers.  The onlyweak character in the show is an ambitious senator (J. T. Walsh) whowants to be the next president.  This character happens to be on boardthe plane, but I wish he hadn't been.  The senator's aid tells him,""Senator I think we are presented with an incredible opportunity here.""The senator quizzically asks, ""Opportunity for what?""  The aid goes onto explain, ""Remember how the press is always talking about your nothaving a war record?  You could be the one to negotiate with theterrorists.""  Walsh's performance is extremely weak, and the moviewould have been more focused without his character.       The show works because of the tension, but there is one technicalaspect deserving of special mention, the cinematography by AlexThomson.  The first time we witness the terrorists in action, they areshown in black and white slow motion sequences that slowly gain colorbefore dissolving into the next black and white sequence.  See the showat your local monster screen house because the images of the stealthfighter coming right at you in the hazy yellow and red glow of earlymorning are quite impressive as is the sound.  The whole linkupsequence is another marvel to behold.  Finally, although the show doesnot try to overwhelm its viewers with technology, I was fascinated bythe way the soldiers look through cameras with small flexible tubing tosee what is going in the main cabin.       The script by Jim and John Thomas sticks to the suspense to keepthe show going.  Other writers would have gone for a lot more laughs.They do use humor, but sparingly.  Upon boarding the 747, one of thesoldiers says, ""I hope they have a good movie on this flight.""EXECUTIVE DECISION, by the way, is one film I guarantee you, you willnever see on an airplane. The movie ends with Frank Sinatra singing,""It's nice to go traveling, but oh so much nicer to come home.""  Bythat time, my adrenaline was pumping so fast, I could have flown homewithout use of a plane.       Since this is about a presidential decision, whom do you thinkthey cast in the role of the president? In the show's majorincredulity, the answer is: nobody!  The president is AWOL throughoutthe entire film and is not available even by telephone since he is outof the country.  I guess he is in one of those fourth world countrieswhere they have no phones.  No problem, since the Secretary of Defensemakes all of the decisions for him.  The situation concerns thedestruction of the nation's capital along with tens of millions ofpeople, but I guess since the president can not be reached, he isdealing with matters of more import.       Finally, every show with bad guys has to have them be of somenationality or religious conviction.  Although most American shows withbad guys, have just plain old Americans as the evil characters, I haveseen the villains be Colombians, Italians, Fundamentalist Christains,and just about everyone imaginable.  In this movie they are Islamic.We were pamphleted on arrival, admonishing us that Islam does notcondone killing.  I wonder if in the future, I will be pamphleted byColombians, Italians, Fundamentalist Christains, etc.?  Oh well, theywere very friendly and polite leafleters.  I should point out that thenumber two in command complains at one point to David Suchet about thedestruction of Washington that, ""This has nothing to do with Islam.""       EXECUTIVE DECISION runs 2:15, but it feels like a much shortershow.  I would advise going to the bathroom before entering thetheater.  You do not want to miss a second of the suspense.  The filmis rated R.  This is a soft R that comes from a little bad language andseveral people killed, but without a lot of blood or gore, more like anold fashion Western.  There is no sex or nudity.  The movie would befine for any teenager.  I loved this show, and I think you will too soI recommend it highly and give it *** 1/2. ",Executive Decision,R,1996,3.5
312," What happens if you single-handedly save the life of the Vice President, killing dozens of bad guys in the process and risking your own life?  If you're Steven Seagal, you will, of course, get in trouble with your superiors for using excessive force.  EXIT WOUNDS, by director Andrzej Bartkowiak, a cinematographer whose only other directorial assignment was on ROMEO MUST DIE, is a standard issue Steven Seagal picture.  With plenty of car crashes, loud explosions, noisy guns and corrupt cops, the script follows the usual formula.  Only in the brief introduction of a dot-com subtheme does the film vary from the standard recipe.  Why they needed two screenwriters (Ed Horowitz and Richard D'Ovidio) and one novelist (John Westermann) to come up with the canonical story is the only mystery.  The story opens hypocritically with the Vice President lecturing on the evils of guns in our society.  After this sop to morality, the hyperviolence begins.  Too bad they couldn't have gotten Quentin Tarantino to do a cameo as the Vice President.  Now, that would have been funny.    Tom Arnold provides the movie's humor, playing controversial television host Henry Wayne.  Officer Orin Boyd (Seagal) meets Wayne in a rageaholic meeting.

313," Do you remember the fable: ""The Emperor's New Clothes""? Becausethis film was made by the late Stanley Kubrick, because two ofHollywood's top stars devoted two years of their lives to itscreation, because the ""hype"" has been so carefully orchestrated...fewhave dared to call this exquisitely photographed film what it is:shallow soft-core pornography. Despite Kubrick's meticulous direction,it's a wretchedly written, cliche-filled dirge about sexual obsession,based on Arthur Schnitzler's ""Traumnovelle"" (1926).  The slow-pacedstory begins with Tom Cruise, as a Manhattan physician, and his wife,played by Nicole Kidman, preparing to attend a lavish Christmas party,hosted by Sydney Pollack. That evening, as she flirts with a suaveHungarian, he's hit on by two giggly models - until he's calledupstairs by the host to revive yet another model who hasoverdosed. Later, while stoned, Kidman taunts Cruise with an erotictale about a naval officer in Cape Cod.  Reeling with jealousy, heindulges in his own angst-filled fantasy, involving a kinky tryst witha hooker and a sinister, masquerade orgy. And he flashes his doctor'sID card more often than an FBI agent. Why Kidman and Cruise chose toindulge in this heavy-handed, exhibitionistic carnal endeavor is bestleft to their personal therapists - and the gossip columnists. Sure,the color-drenched cinematography is stunning but, having said that,it's like leaving a Broadway musical singing the scenery. Inevaluating Jocelyn Pook's moody score, a friend put it bestcommenting: ""The music sounds as if were composed by a piano tuner,pounding on one note."" On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""EyesWide Shut"" is a perverted, pretentious, numbing 3. It may bedeliberately depraved but you won't be deprived if you wait for thevideo. ",Eyes Wide Shut,R,1999,3.5
314,"      In the opening of 1993's FALLING DOWN, a man known mainly by hisvanity license plate name, D-FENS, has reached his breaking point.Stuck in a traffic jam that goes on forever, his air-conditioning hasgone on the fritz, the kids in the school bus nearby are hanging outtheir windows screaming and a pesky fly is driving him crazy.  Doingwhat we all fantasize about, he walks out of his vehicle and declareshe's had it.  As his figure disappears on the horizon, his fellowdrivers are left dumbstruck as to what to make of this act of courageor insanity.       Dressed in a white shirt with a narrow tie and a plastic pocketprotector, D-FENS, played with a blend of grace and irascibility byMichael Douglas, has a crew cut head that is drenched in sweat.  Whenhe walks into a convenience store owned by a Korean, he goes completelyberserk over the owner's inability to give him change.  Using theowner's bat, he trashes the place for no reason other than deep seatedresentment of minorities as he suspects them of having stolen some ofhis opportunities.       When two Hispanic gang members pick him out to hold up, they findthey have chosen the wrong guy.  Although no Steven Seagal, Douglas'sfury imbues D-FENS with extraordinary strength.  In no time, D-FENSbecomes an efficient and unemotional killing machine attacking thepeople he resents, which covers the vast majority of the residents ofSouthern California where he lives.  With his pasty white skin andbright white shirt, D-FENS stands out in the crowd of minorities thatpopulate most of the picture.       D-FENS has no safe haven.  Lost, he wants to return to hisex-wife's house for his daughter's birthday.  With the natural fear ofa deranged ex-husband, Barbara Hershey plays his jumpy ex-wife.       His gripe is not confined to minorities.  When, one minute toolate, he enters a fast food restaurant, he finds that he can no longerorder breakfast from its excessively smiling personnel.  Grinning fromear to ear, the clerk and her manager explain that they are not servingbreakfast anymore.  It is arguably in this scene when he most touches anerve in all of us.  Who among us has not been in a similar situation?When he pulls out his machine gun, all of a sudden he can have the verything that was deemed impossible only seconds earlier.       The beauty of Douglas's everyman performance is how polite heremains to those shocked by his bizarre behavior.  His stiff, awkwardwalk and his sad story leave the viewer with somewhat ambiguousfeelings about him.  One moment you hate him, but the next he begins togenerate some hidden sympathy, most notably in the fast food scene, butalso in others.       In the cliched role of the cop on his last day on the job, RobertDuvall plays a perpetually mild-mannered detective named Prendergast.In contrast to D-FENS's seething anger, Prendergast has the relaxedlook of someone about to retire.  Unfazed, he enjoys his last day inhis war against criminals.  ""I don't like you,"" his boss admits.  ""Youknow why?  You don't curse.  I don't trust a man who doesn't curse.""(The once beautiful and slender Tuesday Weld, now with rolls of fat,plays Prendergast's clingy wife.)       ""I'm the bad guy?"" asks a disbelieving D-FENS when finally trappedby Prendergast.  ""How did that happen?""  Swept up in a tide of eventsthat has engulfed his life, he has no idea what has happened to him.He was just an average Joe Engineer only a month ago before he was laidoff.       Part Orwellian morality tale and part bizarre little movie,FALLING DOWN both fascinates and repulses the viewer.  It is an unevenand frequently pretentious story that is never as important or dramaticas it thinks it is.  Still, there is a hint of truth in every sceneeven if overblown.  When the film ends, you realize that it has touchedhidden nerves in strange and unsettling ways.       FALLING DOWN runs 1:48.  It is rated R for profanity and violence.The film would be acceptable for teenagers. ",Falling Down,R,1993,2.5
315,"Nicolas Cage, as Jack Campbell, the wealthy president of amergers-and-acquisitions firm, is living La Dolce Vita in his Manhattanpenthouse and savoring every minute of it.  With $2,400 suits, alightning-fast Ferrari and his own limo, he has it all, right down to a""closet"" that is like an expensive men's clothing boutique. Well he thinks he has it all until an angry man with a gun (Don Cheadle)interrupts Jack's life to show him a ""glimpse"" of what he is missing.  DavidDiamond and David Weissman's imaginative script is equal parts SLIDINGDOORS, A CHRISTMAS CAROL and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.   Director Brett Ratner,known for his broad comedy RUSH HOUR, shows that he is capable of surprisingsubtlety and grace.  THE FAMILY MAN is touching and poignant without evergetting anywhere near schmaltz.  Even if it's more effective as a romanticdrama than a comedy, it does have many wonderfully funny moments. The story opens at the airport in 1987, where Jack is leaving his collegegirlfriend Kate (T_a Leoni, DEEP IMPACT) for a one-year internship abroad.Fearing that their relationship will not survive the oceanic separation, shemakes a futile, last minute plea for him to stay. We quickly cut to 13 years later, when it's Christmas Eve.  Jack has histroops working on a 120-billion dollar merger deal.  His old lover, Kate,has called out of the blue.  Jack's chairman (Josef Sommer) advises him notto return the call.  ""Old flames are like old tax returns,"" he tells Jack.""Put 'em in a file cabinet for 3 years and then cut 'em loose.""  Currentlywith model-quality girlfriends, Jack doesn't seem the least bit interestedin ever dialing Kate's number. The mysterious character played by Don Cheadle shows up, and before Jackknows it, he is ""trapped in the suburbs"" in a New Jersey house with 4bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, a partially finished basement, a big slobbering dog,2 young kids and a wife, Kate.  He thinks that he is still rich, but heisn't, and that he really isn't the family man of his new household, but heis.  Cage's frozen, wide-eyed expression tells it all about his absolutepanic.  He is convincingly confused, shocked, lost and scared.   Most of allJack is appalled by the ordinariness of his new lifestyle.  A big day forthe new Jack is getting treated to a funnel cake at the mall.  His new lifeis almost a complete opposite of everything he has worked for. In a film about Cage's character, Leoni does a terrific job of not beingupstaged by Cage.  She takes what could just be a one-dimensional characterand gives it depth, tenderness and a playful joy. The script, wisely, lets only one person, Jack's little daughter Annie(Makenzie Vega), figure out that Jack has changed.  In an adorableperformance by Vega, Annie decides that Jack is an alien.  Still, she ishappy to show him the ropes on how to be a father, including how to diaperher brother Josh.  One of the biggest laughs comes when Jack leaves Josh atdaycare.  ""Do I get a receipt or something?"" he asks at the daycare centeras he hands off his son, holding him as if he contained toxic waste. The big question about the narrative is how the story will circle back oncethe glimpse is over.  With a completely satisfying resolution, the movieleaves you with a warm spot in your heart.  A perfect film for the Christmasseason, its messages about the meaning of success and the importance offamily is presented with straightforward and genuine warmth.  An honestpicture and a cute one, although not worthy of Christmas classic status, itis rewarding and enjoyable. THE FAMILY MAN runs 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for sensuality and somelanguage and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up. My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the film was ""okay"" and gave it **.  Hecomplained that he was confused by Cheadle's character.  His favorite partsinvolved the kids and the dog.","Family Man, The",PG-13,2000,2.5
316,"      A FAMILY THING is a poignant and beautifully life affirming film.It tells the story of the reunion of two older half-brothers, one blackand one of a mixed race who always thought he was white.  The filmdeals both with racial tolerance and with the larger meaning of life.It is a little film without any pretensions to be more that it is, andit has three outstanding performances in it.  If you are lucky enoughto walk into its door at the local multiplex, you will find you havediscovered a small cinematic gem.       A FAMILY THING starts off in a little town in Arkansas, but thatpart is actually filmed in Tennessee.  When I first saw the garage thatEarl Pilcher, Jr., hereafter called simply Earl (Robert Duvall) and hisfather Earl Sr. (James Harrell) own in a small Southern town, I thoughtit was Shugart's Garage from my old hometown of Garland, Texas.  Itwasn't, but everything from the sets (Linda DeScenna) to the dialog isauthentic, right down to Earl saying, ""yes, sir"" to his father and""yes, ma'am"" to the telephone operator.  Even the traditional southerninherent dislike of potential carpetbaggers is displayed in Earl Sr.'scomplaining to his son about a customer, ""I've never seen a damn Yankeeyet that could operate more than a wheelbarrow.""       At the beginning of the picture Earl's mama dies and leaves him asealed letter revealing the family secret that his father raped a blackgirl and that he is the result of that rape.  Earl's real mama died inchildbirth, and his adoptive mama raised Earl as her own.  In theletter his adoptive mama tells Earl to go to Chicago and look up hiscompletely black half brother, Raymond ""Ray"" Lee Murdock (James EarlJones) who is a policeman.  Earl does this in his pickup truck whichturns into a classic fish out of water sequence.       After meeting Ray, Earl ends up having to spend the night in histiny place along with his old and blind Aunt T (Irma P. Hall) and Ray'sson Virgil (Michael Beach).  Ray and Earl want to part company quickly.That Ray lives near a bad part of town further complicates things.       The show has two stars and a scene stealer, Irma P. Hall, who Ithink is a shoe-in for a best supporting actress nomination for herbossy, funny, and upbeat role as Aunt T.  She tells Earl to get saltedbutter because, ""Don't know why anybody'd eat unsalted butter.  Mightas well eat Vaseline.  Got about as much flavor.""  She is also wisetelling them, ""Nobody ever knows what it's like for somebody else.That's always the problem.""       In another incredible performance by James Earl Jones, he playsRay as a reserved man with deep feelings, but one that is able to laughat others and at himself.  He tells Earl, ""I guess everyone is entitledto make a complete and utter fool of himself every now and then.""Jones's character overflows with humanity.       In this ensemble cast, Duvall's acting is the great, although Iwould rank it third here.  He gets off many a good line.  One of myfavorites has him telling Virgil about playing football in school, ""Iused to play a little ball.  I was small, but I made up for it by beingslow.""  As easily the slowest player on a high school football teamthat won two AAAA state championships, this line really hit home.  Earladvises Virgil another time that, ""Being happy ain't nothin' more thanhavin' something to look forward to.""  Another piece of advice wellworth pondering.       The movie shows Earl as having definite racial prejudices, butmilder than you might guess.  He even sinks to using the N word twicewhich, to be fair, is a lot less that the blacks use it in the film.The script (Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson) is one of the delightsof A FAMILY THING.  The dialog is smart and the characters are notdrawn as cliches as it would have been easy to do.  In a plot wherelittle happens, there are many surprises, scary moments, and manyunpredictable twists.  At its best, as when Earl and Ray share anintimate discussion about their roles in the Korean War, the storyresonates with a beautiful harmony.  The direction by Richard Pearcehas great attention to detail.  Watch, for example, the body languagein the way Earl and Ray sit together on the couch and on the bed.       The movie's ending is set up perfectly, but I would have preferredthem to end a couple of minutes sooner and let our imaginations takeover after they set it up.  The rich music by Charles Gross providesjust the right nostalgic atmosphere.       A FAMILY THING runs just about right at 1:49.  It is correctlyrated PG-13 for a small amount of violence and some bad language.  Ithink the film would be fine for kids over say 8 or 9 if they areinterested in the subject.  I loved the film and see no reason why youwouldn't too.  I recommend the picture and give it ***. ","Family Thing, A",PG-13,1996,3
317,"Americans under the age of fifty know about the 1950's onlyfrom what they've read or heard from their parents or from themovies. They're likely to think of that decade as a conventionalone, a man-in-the-gray-flannel-suit era, when the American dreamwas a white picket fence, a dog, a comfortable, stable life and badmusic.  To a degree this impression is correct. There's quite adifference between the Age of Eisenhower and our own ModernTimes.  Or is there?  Todd Haynes (""Poison,"" ""Safe,"" ""VelvetGoldmine"") was, like most Americans today, born post- fifties andyet affords us a major exploration of the dark currents underlyingthe decade's surfaces.       Featuring Julianne Moore, attired spot-on by designer SandyPowell with a hair style that's more flattering than that worn byAmy Irving for ""Tuck Everlasting,"" Haynes's latest work with hisfavorite actress takes us into the Hartford, Connecticut suburbs of1957 (actually filmed in Bayonne and other parts of New Jersey)to show us that while the outside world can well envy the wealththat gives its principal character a style of life that most of theworld would die for, trouble brews when romantic dreams canoverpower even the most superficially fortuitous existence.      At first we think that Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) and herhusband Frank (Dennis Quaid) are living the American dreamalbeit one that is surprisingly without a dog.  With one son(RyanWard) always eager to get his pop's attention, an obedientdaughter (Lindsay Andretta) and a loyal maid, Sybil (Viola Davis),they enjoy the trappings of wealth, made possible by Frank's jobheading the Hartford office of a major corporation.  His social lifecomes from playing ball with other executives while hersencompasses the social whirl of catered affairs and tete-a-teteswith her best friend, Eleanor Fine (Patricia Clarkson).  Lives take asudden turn south in the family unit when Cathy's husband's""working late at the office"" turns out to be assignations withanother male while Cathy herself feels emotionally drawn to herblack gardener, Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert).  WhileFrank pledges to ""fight against"" the ""deviance"" of homosexualityby consulting a psychiatrist (James Rebhorn), his little secretremains with him and his wife.  Society comes down hard,however, on Cathy, who is discovered by a malicious member ofher social circle entering a restaurant with her black gardener.     Haynes's movie is not simply a story about the fifties: moreimportant, it is filmed in the style used by big studios who oftenshot melodramas in their lots and employed actors like RockHudson, Lana Turner, Jane Wyman, Dorothy Malone, RobertStack, and Agnes Moorehead. ""Far from Heaven"" is splashed withso much color that we're reminded of John Waters, and yetdespite what a few critics have said, I don't believe Haynes meansto be campy.  He is, however, following the paths trod by thetheatrical genius Douglas Sirk,  a product of the Germany of thetwenties and thirties, who catered to an audience love formelodramatic stories.  Sirk, like Haynes, put great care into hissets and clothes.  Both studied bourgeois society and both castlight on what they considered the lifelessness and hypocrisywithin that class.  The women are beautiful but anxious.  Theyrealize that social conventions smother love and lovers.  No matterthat the material in ""Far from Heaven,"" like Sirk's own palettes,are considered trite and soapy.  The movie audience of the fiftiesand, to an extent that going to the theaters today, depends onsensation, glamour, sexuality, fear, and danger; at least thosewho are not now addicted to computer graphics and Bruckheimerblockbusting.     Moore and Quaid have a genuine chemistry.  We see howCathy is bound by social conventions to be her husband'scompanion, to entertain guests, and to have no real life of herown.  It's no wonder that when she begins to talk to her gardener,when she discovers to her amazement at a modern art gallery thathe knows more about Joan Miro than she and for the first timelooks at him as a real human being, something in her awakens. Or that Frank, having finally given in to his homosexual urges, iswilling to chuck away his entire bourgeois life, to give up his wife,his kids and probably his high-power job to take up with a manwith whom he has fallen in love (though that ""love"" with a youngerguy may not last the season).     Aside from the captivating style, from the way that Haynes hascaptured the mood of the 1950s, I think he wants us to ponderwhether we've really changed so much.  Yes, things are differentnow on a surface level.  I went to high school in the early fiftiesand did not see a single African-American in any class.  Aftercollege in Massachusetts (where African-Americans were almostas scarce), I taught in a high school in Brooklyn, New York andthroughout my career in that particular place did not have singleblack student.  Today that same school has done a volte force,going from 100% white to 97% black. We no longer look uponblacks and whites walking together, even holding hands, as didthe gossipy women and even the men on the street in ""Far fromHeaven.""  Nevertheless only a Pollyanna would say there isgender equality today or racial harmony and, if you judge not onlyfrom violent attacks against gays but from the insultingcommentary that passes the lips of so-called straights, we haven'tprogressed that much at all.  With the striking set designs, theclassic performances of Quaid, Moore and Haysbert, and a refusalto fall into the trap of campiness, ""Far from Heaven"" may at firstdistance us by its fifties-style of filmmaking but draws us modernsright into the pain and conflicts of its characters. ",Far From heaven,PG-13,2002,3.5
318," It's January 1997 and, believe it or not, I just saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High for the first time. Like many other 80's favorites that people have been pleading for me to watch and review, it didn't live up to its overinflated hype, but it was still entertaining, and captured the essence of the early 80's, from the primitive video games to fashions and slang. One thing director Amy Heckerling always manages to do well in these aimless teen comedies (e.g. CLUELESS) is integrate what is current-at-the-moment clothes and dialect. This may tend to date her movies, but it also serves as an accessible time capsule to that time.  The movie, based on Cameron Crowe's supposedly factual book, centers around a group of high school kids, most of which work at the mall. Judge Reinhold takes pride in his burger-flipping job, a very young-looking Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates work at a dine-in pizza parlor, and dorky Brian Backer takes movie tickets while his slimeball friend Robert Romanus scalps concert tickets. The unemployed characters are also seen around the mall, with Sean Penn's pothead character Jeff Spicoli attempting to get service sans shirt in Reinhold's burger joint and beefy football player Forrest Whitaker shoving quarter after quarter into Space Invaders and Pac-Man.  There are plenty of in-school scenes featuring two teachers on opposite sides of the spectrum. Vincent Schiavelli is the nervous, outgoing type who wants all the kids to like him and Ray Walston is the crusty old fart who runs his class like a military outfit. Walston's main problem is braindead Spicoli (undoubtedly the inspiration for the BILL & TED movies), who disrupts class on a regular basis and even has a pizza delivered to the classroom one day.  In the Heckerling tradition, there's not much of a plot, just a series of loosely related scenes, most of which involve sex. Cates schools Leigh on a certain sexual technique, Backer tries to work up the courage to ask Leigh out, Reinhold is walked in on by Cates during an intimate personal moment, Penn trashes Whitaker's car, and so on. These anecdotal-type scenes work as a whole and manage to be almost poignant, especially in its telling of Leigh's disastrous history with men and boys.  Cameron Crowe, who has recently hit it big with the wonderful JERRY MAGUIRE, knows how people act and interact, and scripts it well. The ensemble cast acts it well, particularly Penn and Leigh. FAST TIMES is a quintessentially 80's movie, which means it includes sex and nudity. Leigh and Cates disrobed because everyone had to in order to make it big in the 80's. Nudity is a rare commodity these days, and this movie is still cut to shreds when aired on TV, so splurge for the fifty-cent video rental, especially if you're interested in seeing Phoebe Cates' breasts. ",Fast Times at Ridgemont High,R,1992,3
319,"Call me naive, but until I saw director Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious,"" I didn't know there was a such thing as underground car racing gangs in the United States. Not being a mechanic or car aficionado, I also had no idea how cars could so quickly speed up to 140 mph. While the jury's still out on how realistic ""The Fast and the Furious"" is concerning its details on automobiles and racing, I, nonetheless, learned quite a bit from the film--more so than any usual moviegoing experience. I also learned that no matter how many slam-bang action scenes are put into a movie, the entire effort cannot work without a serviceable screenplay.  Set in the seedy world of street racing teams, Brian (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop who has managed to get in with one such group, led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). While his mission is to prove that they not only illegally race, but also hijack trucks on the side, Brian finds himself apprehensive of doing so when he not only becomes good friends with Dominic, but also falls for his sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster).  The plot of ""The Fast and the Furious"" is such a flimsy amalgamation of cliches and tedium that it not only remains wholly predictable from beginning to end, but also doesn't even find its premise until at least a half-hour in. Until then, we are treated to literally one scene after the next of people racing hot--no, make that very hot--cars. When the story finally shifts into high gear and we find that Brian is, indeed, a cop, the stakes are undoubtedly heightened. Unfortunately, this means that the pacing must slow down and the characters actually have to speak. They are not helped much at all by the underwhelming screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer. That it took three separate people to pen such a thin script is quite humorous, and just a little mindboggling.  The action sequences, by the way, are so thrilling that they almost single-handedly save the film from its countless flaws. The tight, precise editing aids in making each and every car racing sequence a high-throttle joy to behold, and a climactic scene involving a botched truck hijack is downright nailbiting. It's very easy to forget about such ""frivolous"" things as character involvement and story developments when your body is being overtaken by such rapid-fire images of excitement and danger. But once each scene has taken its toll, you are grounded back to the reasons why the movie, as a whole, is simply not finding the footing it should.  The cast is professional and attractive, but little else (with two exceptions). Vin Diesel (2000's ""Pitch Black""), that of the muscular build, shaved head, and baritone voice, turns in another effective, highly modulated performance as the loyal Dominic. As his younger sister, Mia, Jordana Brewster (2001's ""The Invisible Circus"") is a strong actress with a brain to go along with her stunning beauty. While it would have been nice to see Brewster act as more than virtual wallpapering, at least she has more to do than Michelle Rodriguez (2000's ""Girlfight""), as Dominic's sensual, hard-edged girlfriend, Letty. Who knows if Rodriguez is any good? All she is asked to do is make brooding, ""I'm-so-tough"" faces on cue. Finally, Paul Walker (2000's ""The Skulls"") gets his very first leading man role as undercover police officer Brian, and he doesn't impress. There just doesn't seem to be anything behind Walker's facial expressions, and so his character doesn't win the audience's sympathies as it should.  Despite several slow patches and an ending that doesn't know when to quit (yet still manages to leave characters and relationships hanging without closure), ""The Fast and the Furious"" offers mindless summer movie fun for 105 minutes. If anything, the action leaves a cursory adrenaline rush. When the movie is over, though, don't expect to think about it again--because you won't.","Fast and the Furious, The",PG-13,2001,1.5
320,"      FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is a surprisingly excellent andtouching comedy.  The director (Charles Shyer), the writers (NancyMeyers and Charles Shyer), and all of the cast are back from FATHER OFTHE BRIDE (1991) which is in turn a remake of the 1950 movie of thesame name.  Unlike the 1991 movie which is broadly written for maximumlaughs, the sequel is an even better movie that relies for its charm onits poignancy although there are innumerable hilarious moments as well.FATHER OF THE BRIDE II had me in tears twice.  On the other hand,I rolled over in laughter so loud in one scene that I scared the womanin front of me.  A very affecting and effective movie.       The setup of FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is a simple one.  GeorgeBanks (Steve Martin) and his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) are a happilymarried couple.  Although they have one kid, Matty (Kieran Culkin), inmiddle school, their daughter Annie Banks (Kimberly Williams) is nowmarried and living a mile away with her new husband, Bryan MacKenzie(George Newbern).  One day the young couple invite both sets ofparents, the Banks and John (Peter Michael Goetz) and Joanna (KateMcGregor-Stewart) MacKenzie, to the Banks's house for the bigannouncement that they are expecting.       The reaction ranges from rapture to being stunned.  As Matty putsit, ""I'm 4' 6"", I don't shave, I don't have a job, and I'm going to bean uncle.  Isn't there something weird about that?""  George flies intoa middle age panic, and he dies his beautiful flowing gray hair jetblack.  He thinks he is too young to be a grandfather.  He reminds usthat he is 31 days younger than Bill Clinton.  After he dies his hair,a beautiful blonde in a red Ferrari convertible makes a pass at him ata red light, but he sheepishly points to his wedding ring.       One of the stars of the movie is the family home - a classic EastCoast style two story in a typical New England neighborhood full ofautumn trees which somehow manages to be located in Southern Californiain this show.  George decides to sell it reasoning, ""We could sell thishouse in a second.  It's the Leave It to Beaver house everyone wants.""The sale of their home and its ramifications are both touching andextremely funny.  The writers will really surprise you with what theydo with this one.       Perhaps one of the reasons this movie works so well for me are allof the similarities with my own life.  George is my age almost to theday.  Like us, they are selling the house they have lived in for manyyears, they have to vacate the house quickly, and their dishes, whichplay a prominent role in the film, are exactly the same as ours.  Weare even older parents with a young child (6 in our case).  To behonest though, I have had no problems with harassment by Ferraris.       The movie is filled with touching scenes.  There is one of fatherand daughter playing basketball.  It is filmed as a series offlashbacks starting at age 4.  The cinematography (Elliot Davis) andthe editing (Stephen Rotter) are absolute perfection.  KimberlyWilliams does a wonderful job as a role model of what every parenthopes their children turn into - sweet, smart, good looking, happy, andsuccessful.  The basketball scene forms a key part of her character'sdevelopment in the movie.       The twist in the story that makes it click is that George and Ninafind that they too are expecting a baby which pleases Nina but scaresGeorge.  While driving through town Nina sees idyllic families filmedin sepia whereas George can only see families with little monsters.  Hetells Nina, ""together we're almost a hundred!""  Eventually George triesto put a good face on it all.  He reassures Nina with ""Just becausewe're older doesn't mean we're old.  It's the 90s."", and ""Going to themovies will be economical: one child and two seniors!""       The movie deals straightforwardly and effectively with manyserious subjects.  The fear of your kids growing up and moving acrosscountry is an emotional ones for most parents.  Our only son is justsix, but is already planning on leaving and moving to Montana to be apaleontologist when he grows up, which is as freighting to me as thepossibility of Annie moving away is to George.       The best part of the entire movie are the birthing scenes at theend.  Times of major emotion and uproarious laughter in the theater.Throughout the show Steve Martin is at the top of his form.  He candeliver lines as well as facial expressions without speaking thatalternatively have you in stitches one minute and ready to cry thenext.  A brilliant performance.       The rest of the cast is equally strong.  Keaton, who can be toocutesy or quirky, is carefully directed and delivers her warmestperformance since REDS.  Martin Short again plays Franck Egglehoffer,but in the sequel he is not so obnoxious.  In this film, he does not gooverboard as he so frequently does, and gives the only lovable andtouching as well as comedic role I have ever seen him in.  In a minorbut well cast role we have Jane Adams as Dr. Megan Eisenberg.       FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is a joy to behold.  A life-affirmingfilm whose almost last line is ""Life doesn't get much better thanthis.""  Amen.       FATHER OF THE BRIDE II runs a brisk 1:46.  It is rated PG,but it is a totally non-offensive show that should have been rated G.There is no sex, nudity, violence, bad language, or smoking.  You couldtake a kid of any age, but given the story, I suspect it will onlyinterest kids over say 8.  I recommend the movie to you strongly, and Iaward it *** 1/2. ",Father of the Bride Part II,PG,1995,3.5
321,"      ""We were somewhere on the edge of the desert when the drugs tookhold,"" explains the stoned and wild-eyed journalist Raoul Duke.  Hespeeds along like an out-of-control missile in the opening to FEAR ANDLOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, which is based on the famoussemi-autobiographical novel by Hunter Thompson about his gonzojournalism.  Set in a stoned-out 1971, the movie's central character,Raoul, and his sidekick and attorney, Dr. Gonzo, spend the entirepicture ripped, stoned, plastered, wasted, you name it.  With acornucopia of drugs in the trunk of their rented Cadillac convertible,they are on their way to Las Vegas, where they will cover the nationalconvention of District Attorneys, among other things.  Mainly they aregoing so they can party using every illegal substance you've ever heardof and some you haven't.       As directed by the wildly imaginative Terry Gilliam from MONTYPYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, BRAZIL, THE FISHER KING and TWELVE MONKEYS,the comedy starts off so ridiculously that you can expect many peopleto walk out in disgust.       The remarkably talented Johnny Depp plays the lead, Raoul.  To hiscredit, Depp takes what starts as an almost unwatchably bad movie andmanages to make it kind of fascinating.  With arms waving at imaginedterrors, with feet and legs wobbling so he can barely walk withoutfalling, and with a voice that sounds like it's coming from the bottomof a well, he looks so convincingly drugged out of his mind that you'llwant to help him into treatment.  When he walks, he darts from wall towall due to his drug-induced paranoia.  You see, he has killer batschasing him.  Depp's performance is so over the top and mesmerizingthat he manages to make you care about a highly unsympatheticcharacter.       Benicio Del Toro takes a more by the numbers approach to the partof Dr. Gonzo.  He mumbles so many of his lines that he makes hischaracter believable but rarely interesting.       A host of actors appear in cameo roles.  Gary Busey plays a machopoliceman who chases the speeding and stoned Raoul.  The policeman isan understanding sort, who orders Raoul to get some rest and asks onlyfor a little kiss in return.  Christina Ricci plays a teenager whopaints large oil portraits of Barbra Streisand while watching her ontelevision.  Raoul and Dr. Gonzo have nightmares about her naming themin a statutory rape trial.       In one of the film's best scenes, Raoul's drugged brain morphs abar of conventioneers into a group of alien monsters like those in thebar scene in STAR WARS.  In another scene, the pattern in the carpetstarts to move and eventually turns to flowing blood.  The specialeffects in the movie are inventive and the psychedelic colors of thesets by THE CROW's Alex McDowell are eye-catching.  And when the moviegets utterly absurd, as it frequently does, at least the audience isentertained by some great music of the late 60s and early 70s.       FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS runs 1:55.  It is rated R forconstant drug usage and would be fine for kids only if they are ofcollege age. ",Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,R,1998,2
322,"One of the things that make psychology so fascinating is thefact that the same events create different reactions todifferent people. This is case even with the worst possibletraumas, when the most experienced psychologists havedifficulties dealing with psychological aftermath. FEARLESS,1993 drama directed by Peter Weir, represents the study ofone of such characters permanently altered with suchexperience.  The movie is based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias, whowrote the script. Max Klein (played by Jeff Bridges) hasjust survived the terrible plane crash, which left many ofhis co-passengers dead. Klein helps other survivors to leavethe burning plane and afterwards simply wonders off, noteven bothering to tell his wife Laura (played by IsabellaRosselini) that he is alive. Afterwards he is found, broughtback to his family, but his wife can't fail to notice thather husband is a totally changed man. Max escaped certaindeath and now he thinks of himself as invulnerable andgodlike. Airline-appointed psychologist Bill Perlman (playedby John Turturro) can't reach him, but Klein, who becametotally alienated from his family, finds spiritualconnection with Carla Rodrigo (played by Rosie Perez),grief-stricken mother whose child died in the same planecrash.  FEARLESS, same as many other movies by Peter Weir, is hardlyexperience which could leave viewers with smiles on theirfaces. It is grim, uncompromising drama that deals withdeath and makes the audience think about arbitrary nature ofthat unavoidable fact of life. This is achieved through thesharp contrast between two characters who are differentlyaffected with the same event, both in their soul and in theways they communicate with outside world. Max, who isexcellently played by Jeff Bridges, might see himself as aperson who cheated death, but since he can't connect withthe outside world anymore, his freedom is only superficial -for all the loved ones he might be dead, nothing more than astranger dwelling in his body. Rosie Perez is also very goodas survivor whose guilt and grief make her not only veryalive, but the only person able to bring back emotionallydead Max to the world of living. Unfortunately, Weir hassome problems in pacing of the film, and the large segmentson the film being wasted on unnecessary subplots orcharacters, like John Turturro's therapist or money-grabbingattorney played by Tom Hulce. The hallucinatory endingdoesn't answer questions about the nature of Max'sexperience, and although some films might benefit fromleaving some questions opened, FEARLESS is not one of them.But it could still be recommended as one of those rareHollywood examples of thought-provoking cinema. ",Fearless,R,1993,2
323,"      FEAST OF JULY is a movie based on an H. E. Bates novel.  For thoseof us who have read his books or seen any of the wonderful MasterpieceTheater adaptations on TV (""Love for Lydia"", ""Country Matters"", etc.),we know right away that something special is about occur when we seeBates name.  He is a master storyteller with a gift for getting deepinto the inner spirit of people.  His stories are usually tragedieswhere the protagonists strive gallantly in elusive quests forhappiness.  His stories are quiet ones with much depth and heavycharacterizations.  They tear at your heart.       The movie FEAST OF JULY ranks among the best of the Bates moviesand mini-series.  First time movie director Christopher Menaul (who didthe great ""Prime Suspect I"" on TV) does a brilliant job of moving Batesto the big screen without removing any of the small aspects that makesBates's works so special.  It would have been a temptation to try tojazz up the script with more dialog or to direct the actors to be morelively, but he showed great control and confidence in his material.  Heknew that he had a strong cast, and he could rely on the story and onfacial expressions and body language to tell much of the tale.  Batesteaches us all about the human spirit, and Menaul trusted his audiencenot to get bored, but to pay attention and get wrapped up in anentrancing story.       As the movie opens, it is the late 1800s, and Bella Ford (EmbethDavidtz) is pregnant and is in a personal forced march across a bleakEnglish countryside in bad weather.  She stops in a hut where bloodstarts pouring out from under where she has fallen exhausted.  She ishaving an extremely realistic miscarriage.  From the first scene ourhearts go out for her.  With a single image the director and some greatacting have already captured our heart.  I rarely want to cry threeminutes into a show as I did then.       Bella comes to a town looking for Arch Wilson (Greg Wise) who toldher he was going to marry her but vanished getting her pregnant.  He isnot to be found, but the father, Ben (Tom Bell), of the Wainwrightfamily takes pity on her and takes her in their home to live for awhile.  The mother (Gemma Jones) gives Bella her daughter's clothessince the daughter died of a fever three years ago.  The sons, Jedd(James Purefoy), Con (Ben Chaplin), and Matty (Kenneth Anderson), areall in their 20s like Bella.  They think she is pretty, and slowlythere develops a rivalry among them for her attention.  This rivalryplus Bella's continuing search for Arch Wilson is the heart of thetale.  Although it was a novel, it feels like a short story since ithas such simplicity and yet great intensity.       Even the little parts of the story are special.  Matty is a shoemaker and thinks he is one of the best in England.  He brags to Bellathat he once made the smallest shoes ever made in England.  They werefor a midget who performed on stage.  His plight is that, with theindustrial revolution, shoes are made by machines faster and cheaperthan he can craft them by hand.  He feels that he must leave his littlevillage and move to London since only there will they be able to affordcustom made shoes.  He is melancholy and yet resigned to his fate as heexplains it to Bella.       The sets appear to be extremely accurate recreations of theperiod.  Quite compelling.  The cinematography by Peter Sova isincredible.  Where do I begin with so many examples?  Let me cite justtwo.  In the fog scenes, the characters move through the fog like sadblack ghosts as only their outline shows.  In the scene of the lightingof the gas lamps on the street at night and of the dinners lit only byoil lamps, the pictures are realistically dark and yet possess a warmglow as if it is a metaphor of the attempt for inner peace of all ofthe characters.       All of the actors and actresses delivery terrific performances.It is hard to single out any since it is an ensemble piece of acting.I guess Embeth Davidtz is my favorite, but all were so good.  With onlya few lines, Gemma Jones steals most of the scenes she is in.  You mayremember her as the Duchess in ""The Duchess of Duke Street.""       The dialog as written by Bates and as carefully and lovinglyadapted for the screen by Christopher Neame, is sparse and yetcarefully constructed for maximum effect.  Each of the characters isspecial in some way.  Con, for example, is somewhat of a simpleton wholoves penguins.  He is extremely gentle with them and feeds them daily.In the human world, he is awkward.  He can not dance and has troublecontrolling his emotions.  Finally, the ending of the movie isexcellent and left me gripping the chair as the credits started toroll.       FEAST OF JULY runs 1:58 and never drags.  It is rated R for sexand violence.  It would be excellent for teenagers of all ages to seeit.  I highly recommend this heart wrenching tragedy to you, and I giveit *** 1/2.  With a little stronger middle, it could have gotten my toprating. ",Feast of July,R,1995,3.5
324,"Those who have read some of my previous reviews know that Ihave some problems accepting words like ""comedy"" and ""IvanReitman"" in the same sentence. In the decade and half afterGHOSTBUSTERS, his last truly funny film, Reitman wasconstantly failing to make any film able to produce laughteramong audience. This failure was most the evident case ofHollywood creative bankruptcy associated with ""high concept""films, and it wasn't limited only on Reitman's work asdirector. Reitman record as producer was equallyunimpressive, and FEDS, 1988 comedy directed by Dan Goldbergis just another example.  The heroine of this film is Elizabeth De Witt (played byRebecca de Mornay), former Marine that decides to become anFBI Agent. Before being enrolled in FBI Academy she is toldthat only a fraction of the class would actually finish thecourse, graduate and become an agent. Her own prospects seemdiscouraging, since she lacks school credentials and skillsnecessary to wrestle with high academic demands. JanisZuckerman (played by Mary Gross), her nerdish roommate, hasquite another problem - she could eat toughest academiccourses for breakfast, but her physical skills and fitnessseem way bellow high FBI standards. After a while both womendecide to compensate each other's flaws with tutoring.  Probably some time during production Goldberg and hisscreenplay co- writer Len Bloom realised that their gagssimply aren't funny and that this rather weak copy of POLICEACADEMY couldn't work. So, they added some usual storyingredients - action in the form of bank robbery subplot,and some romance for our heroine, although failed one in theform of hunkish would-be agent Brent Shepard, played by KenMarshall. Even with that, this film remain unattractive andits short length shows the lack of creative juices among itsmakers. Luckily, charm and tragically underused comedictalent of Rebecca de Mornay save this film from turning intototal disaster. Unlike Mary Gross, who has the same facialexpression for the most of the film, she gives some realismand humanity for her character.  Another thing that gives some purpose to this film is itseducational value. Those who are able to swallow Bloom's andGoldberg's weak attempts on humour could get someinteresting insight into the inner workings of world's mostfamous law enforcement organisation (after LAPD, of course).The training course is presented seriously and realisticallywith future Senator Fred Dalton Thompson playing quitebelievable chief instructor and giving lessons usually notapplied by most of the on-screen lawmen. FBI, just as anyother police organisation in the world, relies on its brainsmore than its guns, and this film reflects that - goodpsychological skills, intelligence and mastery ofcomplicated legal procedures are actually more valuable thansimple gunplay. This message of FEDS is more important thancliched and unsuccessful attempts to preach feminism. ",Feds,PG-13,1988,1
325,"      After reading a bunch of bad reviews about FEELING MINNESOTA, buthearing that Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs, I went wondering whatthey liked about it.  I've now seen it, and I'm still wondering.       FEELING MINNESOTA is a would be romantic comedy, but actually isabout as tasty as bowl of cold mush on a winter morning.  This is amean spirited show, that will probably make you wish you had neverwasted your time.  It also serves as further proof, if any is needed,that Keanu Reeves has a proclivity for choosing bad material as if hisagent gets him a bonus for doing them.       In one of the first scenes, a woman named Freddie (Cameron Diaz)is being chased by some hoods through a remote Industrial district.When a man finally grabs her and pins her down with a big gun in herface, it looks like we are about to have a gang rape scene.  Instead wefind the man demanding that she live up to her bargain and marry SamClayton (Vincent D'Onofrio).       Soon we switch to their wedding where she meets Sam's brotherJjaks (Keanu Reeves) for the first time.  [No this is not a typo, hisname is ""Jjaks.""]  She quickly gets Jjaks in a bathroom and rapes him.I supposed you could label it surprise sex instead if you prefer, butcertainly there is no seduction or even a hint that she likes himbefore she starts pulling his clothes off.       At the wedding is Sam's mother Norma played embarrassingly bad byTuesday Weld.  Here is an actress who once could charm the bark off thetrees.  Today she looks bloated and lifeless.  Other than show up, shedoes nothing for the picture.       Dan Aykroyd repeats his bumbling character routine in the show.He plays a caricature of an incompetent cop by the name of BenCostikyan.  Aykroyd makes a mess of every scene he appears in, but thento be fair, so does everyone else.       I kept think about poor Minnesota.  In films great (FARGO) andworthless (FEELING MINNESOTA), it is shown as a bleak and forgottenplace populated by crooks and lowlifes.  Granted I have only been theretwice, but I liked the state.  Oh well, perhaps there is a producerright now working on a picture that show the state in a better light.       Speaking of light, the cinematography by Walt Lloyd is on the darkside of depressing.  He uses dull grays and blues to accentuate thesaturnine tone of the writing and the directing, both by first timewriter and director Steven Baigleman.  Well, at least Baigleman's nextfilm now can only be better.       The saddest part for me was watching talented and attractiveCameron Diaz give the first bad performance I had seen her give.  Iloved her in the great low budget film THE LAST SUPPER and thought shewas good too in SHE'S THE ONE.  Here her work is totally unconvincing.She gives an unsympathetic performance that makes you yearn for thereal Diaz.  She even has the word ""slut"" tattooed on her arm to makesure you get the point.  Subtle this script is not.       After lots more sex between Jjaks and Freddie, included thecliched scene of them doing it in a car and then making the car rollinto the traffic by hitting the gear shift lever, Jjaks decides toleave her because ""it feels too good.""  He comes back, surprise, andthey leave together.  There is a subplot about Jjaks going back to getmoney out of his brother's house for her.  Also, there is a fair ofpetty thievery and random violence.  One gory scenes includes an earbeing partially cut off and then carried around.  From here, you canwrite the script yourself and probably guess most of it.  Not thatyou'd want to bother of course.       Before closing, I want to share a couple of little ""gems"" from thescript.  Freddie philosophizes that, ""Time is like an orange.  It'sround.  It repeats itself.  Everything happens for a reason.""  Probablywant to put that on your wall at work.  In a scene at the pool of acheap motel that is a take off on the motel scene from LEAVING LASVEGAS, Freddie tells Jjaks that, ""I dream of being in a Las Vegas hotelwhere all of the towels smell like Downy Fabric Softener.""  Gosh, whatimagery. ",Feeling Minnesota,R,1996,1
326,"Brian De Palma is out to get Lynched this time around with aplot that could have been inspired by ""Mulholland Drive.  Though""Femme fatale,"" which could be subtitled ""Camera Shy,"" looksmore like Mulholland Drivel except for the opening scene when DePalma puts Topkapi into Cannes, the film still has  the intrigueevoked by a gorgeous young woman reinventing herself afterdouble-crossing some mean-looking guys who never realized thatdiamonds are a girl's, not a boy's, best friend.  The opening twentyminutes or so, which is (thankfully) almost bereft of dialogue,show De Palma as the masterful visual stylist he is, taking usthrough an intricate jewel robbery at the Cannes Film Festival of2001.  Fewer eyes are on Sandrine Bonnaire than on a woman inthe audience with a $10 million outfit that leaves her this close tonudity, a serpentine hunk of jewelry barely covering her mostinteresting spots and making her the target of thieves like BlackTie (Eriq Ebouaney) and Racine (Edourd Montoute) who are moreinterested in her attire than in what it barely covers. After the heist, Laure Ash (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), whose jobis to remove the serpent from its Eve (which she does in aremarkable and gratuitously sexy scene), flees with the treasure,chased by those two meanies who don't like to be double-crossedout of their share of the $10 mil.  Stashing herself and the loot inParis, Laure winds up through an almost ludicrous set ofcircumstances to be in the home of one Lily (also RebeccaRomijn-Stamos), taking her identity when Lily commits suicide. Running into a successful entrepreneur, Bruce Hewitt Watts(Peter Coyte), on a flight to the U.S., she winds up back in Francewhen Watts becomes the American ambassador to the City ofLights, is captured in a photograph by paparazzo Nicolas Bardo(Antonio Banderas), and juggles Nicolas, Black Tie, and Racine inan intricate and often absurdly detoured plan to stay alive. Borrowing badly from Hitchcock, De Palma punctuates the earlyscenes with  Ryuichi Sakamoto's ominous and unsubtle music topunch up the suspense, but while the director's visual style isoften captivating, he falls back on his usual signature byembracing the looniness of both ""Body Double"" (about an actorobsessed with a beautiful woman he spots through a telescope);and ""Dressed to Kill"" (psycho-like killer stalks two women); andthe particularly unpleasant violence of his ""Scarface"" remake. Dialogue, mercifully spare, is not this film's strong point andAntonio Banderas looks as bewildered in real life as he pretendsto be in the story.  Yet for fans of hoots like ""Showgirls""-those ofus who like particularly violent scenes, some lapdancing and sexwith all its gyrations, and a beatiful face like that of Cosmo andSports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Rebecca Romijn-Stamos: andyou don't mind stories that reward technique and visual impactwithout much moral sense; this is not a pic to write off.",Femme Fatale,R,2002,2.5
327," The team who brought us 'A Fish Called Wanda' in 1988 re-team for 'FierceCreatures.'  There is an old saying in life which is ""You can't go homeagain.""  That was never more true than with the production of 'FierceCreatures.' John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palinreturn in a film that has nothing to do with 'A Fish Called Wanda' butperhaps it should have.  A sequel would have been a far more interestingconcept than this plotline.  A multi-billionaire (Kevin Kline) who is trulya hard edged businessman/rascal employs his son (also played by KevinKline)to travel from Atlanta to merry old England to investigate thecorporate restructuring of a zoo run by a bumbling but well meaning chap(John Cleese).  Along for the ride is Jamie Lee Curtis to assist in theinvestigation and rounding out the cast is Michael Palin as a zoo employeewho is key to the film's bizarre climax.  Putting it plainly, 'FierceCreatures' is a disaster not so much because of what it's about but becauseit tries to capture the same level of humour as 'A Fish Called Wanda' did.The personalities of the characters in this movie are similar in nature to'Wanda' and some of the scenes are downright copycats of that film.  Thejokes and the physical gags are surprisingly flat and the movie is abruptlyimmature at the wrong moments and the word that comes to mind to sum it allup is 'phony'.  Even more preposterous is the fact that it took two men todirect this farcical mess (Robert Young and Fred Schepisi)and John Cleese isaided in the screenplay by Iain Johnstone.  Producer Michael Shamberg shouldhave recognized that this film wouldn't work and even if you've never seen'A Fish Called Wanda' you still will recognize the flaws that make thisproduction superficial and self-serving. ",Fierce Creatures,PG-13,1997,1.5
328," The cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses forquite sometime now: ""IT MU5T BE FOUND.""  So what, exactly, is The FifthElement?  After seeing Luc Besson's ambitious, much-shrouded-in-secrecyscience fiction fantasy, I could not help but be let down by the actualanswer, which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think.  Butwhat is far from a letdown is the film as a whole, a wildly imaginativefeast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction filmsdo--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen.  The biggest irony of The Fifth Element is that the one thing thathas been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the mostconventional, dismayingly so, element (pun intended) of the film.  Speakingin the vaguest possible terms, the basics of the plot are as follows: in theyear 2259, a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth, and onlythe four elements--earth, wind, fire, and water--united with a fifth elementcan stop it.  Figuring into all of this are New York cabbie Korben Dallas(Bruce Willis); a shady, Southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of Zorg(the hilariously hammy Gary Oldman, picking up where he left off in Besson'sThe Professional); a priest (Ian Holm); and a mysterious creature namedLeeloo (Milla Jovovich).  All of the pieces come together in a tidy andsomewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion, but there is no denyingthat this basic story holds some intrinsic interest.  What remains interesting and exciting, however, after brief glimpsesis the fascinating world Besson has created with production designer DanWeil, director of photography Thierry Arbogast, visual effects supervisorMark Stetson, and the crew at Digital Domain.  The look is absolutelymesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last.  The frenziedcityscape of New York, with its vibrant day-glo colors, tall buildingspenetrating high into the clouds, and the swarm of cars, cabs, and othervehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways, is absolutely breathtaking tobehold, especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film.  Butit would not have been a completely captivating vision if the peopleinhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting, and are they ever.In addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate thisworld, from bulky robots to dog-like Mangalores, the humans are outfitted incostumes by eccentric designer Jean-Paul Gaulthier, best known for creatingMadonna's pointy bustier get-up in her Blonde Ambition tour.  Gaulthier'soutlandish creations, such as a number worn by Leeloo made entirely out ofwhite straps, feel more at home in Besson's futuristic vision than on anyfashion runway in the world; they add to the sense of otherworldliness aboutthe film.  While Besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film, italso could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience.  For all itsimagination, certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky andbizarre.  I really do not know what middle America will make of the mostoutrageous character of the film, Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), a flamboyantdisc jockey who makes Dennis Rodman look conservative--he makes a raucousentrance dressed in an animal print dress, sporting a blonde hairdo in theshape of a hair dryer, speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed.   Atfirst this character's hyper energy is funny, but the act wears out itswelcome very quickly.  Not irritating, but just as strange, is a musicalnumber by blue-skinned alien chanteuse Diva (Maiwenn LeBesco), whosings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera andtechno.  The tune, as with the entirety of longtime Besson collaborator EricSerra's innovative score, is haunting, but it is also completely jarring.Then there are the campy touches of humor Besson and co-scripter Robert MarkKamen sprinkle throughout, which too often are silly and forced; a comicsexual encounter between Ruby Rhod and a flight attendant is highlydistracting and not very funny, to boot.  The story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion ofThe Fifth Element.  While still visually and aurally spectacular, the eventsdetailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be.  The big,serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers, and itambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun towork toward.  As such, at the end there is a sense that there was somethingbigger at work here, that there was still more left to be said about thisstory and these characters.  This suspicion was confirmed by Besson himself,who told me in the lobby following the screening (imagine that, thefilmmaker watching the film with the ""enemy""--the critics) that what hadmade it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy originalFifth Element screenplay and that the second half--now titled Mr. Shadow--isstill waiting to be made.  Still, despite the story problems, The Fifth Element is an artistictriumph for Luc Besson; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come tothe screen in all its audacious, undiluted glory.  It is a fascinatingexample of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audienceinto an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams. ","Fifth Element, The",PG-13,1997,2.5

He introduces Norton to the raw, animalistic instinct forsurvival. When their bare-fist brawls outside a bar attract cheeringcrowds, they create an underground network of secret, private clubswhere self-destructive, disillusioned professionals can seek solacefrom despair by pummeling each other to smithereens. ""This is yourlife,"" Durden says, ""and it's ending one day at a time.""  Soon Durdenbecomes a subversive cult hero, a grungy messiah for thesado-masochists of an emotionally-dead generation suffering from theonslaught of consumerism and technology. And Helena Bonham Carter isthe funny, foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, self-help junkie who comesbetween the two men.  Adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls from ChuckPalahniuk's gritty best-seller and directed by David Fincher(""Seven""), it's a fast-paced, stylized man's movie, exploring thepsychology of violence, complete with a sub-plot involving bath soapmade from human body fat from a liposuction clinic. Both Norton andPitt deliver knockout performances, relishing the wry, cruel nihilisthumor. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Fight Club"" is aninsidious, cynical, savage 8.  But it's socially irresponsible andrepellent in its graphic depictions of extreme violence and brutality. ",Fight Club,R,1999,3
330,"The fish-out-of-water genre has been good to director Jonathan Lynnin the past, having made 1992's ""My Cousin Vinny""one of the best andsmartest comedies of that decadeand 2000's ""The Whole Nine Yards.""With a solid comedic script, Lynn is a master of setting up jokesand making them work splendidly, all the while creating winning, believablecharacters. Because the screenplay (credited to Elizabeth Hunter andSaladin K. Patterson) for ""The Fighting Temptations"" is not in thesame league, wasting undeniable comic potential with insipid, watered-downwriting and characterizations, even director Lynn cannot make it work.   When his estranged Aunt Sally Walker (Ann Nesby) passes away, NewYork junior ad executive Darrin Hill (Cuba Gooding Jr.) finds himselftraveling back to the small southern town he and his mother (FaithEvans) were driven away from as a child because of her ""sinful"" loungesinging act. Darrin plans to only stay for his aunt's funeral, butwhen, in her will, she hands over the reigns to him for her church'sgospel choir (and a ""Gospel Explosion"" competition that could earnhim $150,000), he decides to stay and fulfill her wishes. With a dwindlingchoir, most of whom are amateur singers, Darrin enlists childhoodsweetheart and single mother Lilly (Beyonce Knowles), a talented loungesinger herself, to aid the group to victory.   ""The Fighting Temptations"" can easily be split into two halvesthegospel musical numbers and the dialogue-driven scenes. The formeris soulful, rapturously performed, and entertaining. The latter ishalf-baked and unconvincing. One of the more predictable motion picturesin some time, every last plot development can be telegraphed so farin advance that to be surprised at any point would mean that thisis likely the first movie you've ever seen. None of this would matter,of course, if not for its marred opportunities in evoking laughs ormagnetism. Save for a handful of good passing comic moments (the localtrash-talking DJ, played with flair by Steve Harvey, and Aunt SallyWalker's funeral procession garner the bulk of them), the film iscertainly no ""Sister Act,"" which it is largely reminiscent of.   The burgeoning romance between Darrin and Lilly, a church outcastherself for having a child out of wedlock, is strictly by-the-numbers,not helped by singer-actress Beyonce Knowles' (2002's ""Austin Powersin Goldmember"") clumsy, half-hearted line deliveries. Knowles hasa gorgeous voice and knows how to play a room while singing (her renditionof ""Fever"" is particularly energetic), but when she steps off thestage and must develop a character and interact with her co-stars,her lack of thespian training shines through. On the basis of Knowles'acting work thus far, fellow Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland(2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason"") is infinitely more natural in front of the camera.   For Cuba Gooding Jr. (2003's ""Boat Trip""), this is just another entryto add to his quickly growing list of mediocre efforts. Gooding Jr.has a gift for comedy (look no further than his Oscar-winning partin 1996's ""Jerry Maguire""), but he doesn't have a gift for pickingscripts that show off what he obviously has to offer. Filling themembers of his choir are LaTanya Washington, LaTanya Richardson, MelbaMoore, Angie Stone (2002's ""The Hot Chick""), T-Bone, Dave Sheridan(2001's ""Corky Romano""), and ""Golden Girls"" star Rue McClanahan, allof whom have nothing to work with other than the music they are singing.   With a running time over two hours, ""The Fighting Temptations"" protractsthe inevitable outcome of the story to ridiculous lengths. Had thecomedy been brighter and the forward momentum of the narrative notso subdued, then all would be well. As is, the film remains bearablebarelythankssolely to its toe-tapping music. Since you can get the same effectby buying the soundtrack album, there is no need to endure the tiresomeshenanigans that surround the songs in ""The Fighting Temptations."" ","Fighting Temptations, The",PG-13,2003,2.5
331,"  It's tempting to call this another version of Gus Van Sant's""Good Will Hunting,"" because it's about a brilliant, strugglingstudent, or ""Scent of a Woman,"" since it deals with a young man andhis mentor, but I think it stands on its own. Newcomer Rob Brown playsJamal, a South Bronx teen who's fascinated by ""the window,"" amysterious man who stares down at the guys shooting hoops in the'hood. On a dare, Jamal sneaks into his book-cluttered apartment,where he's discovered by its occupant. Terrified, he flees, leavinghis backpack behind. The next day, the backpack is thrown down from""the window"" and his six journals, filled with thoughts and essays,have been critiqued in red ink. Thus, an unlikely friendshipdevelops. ""The window"" turns out to be William Forrester, a reclusiveauthor - think J.D. Salinger - who, 50 years ago, published onePulitzer Prize-winning novel. And Jamal winds up in a posh Manhattanprep school where he's welcomed for his ability on the basketballcourt but challenged about his incredible flair for creative writingby a bitter, autocratic teacher, F. Murray Abraham, who accuses him ofplagiarism. Problem is: Mike Rich's screenplay is familiar,predictable and not particularly believable. As the gruff, neuroticnovelist, Sean Connery is charismatic, exuding eccentricities,defending his isolation, gulping J&B and wearing socks inside out. RobBrown is convincing, like rapper Busta Rhymes, as his brother, andAnna Paquin, as his friend/love interest. Joey Buttafuco plays asecurity guard and there's a ""surprise"" cameo near the conclusion. Onthe Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Finding Forrester"" is aninspirational 7, proclaiming, ""Family isn't always what you're bornwith - sometimes it's the people you find, sometimes it's the peoplewho find you."" ",Finding Forrester,PG-13,2000,2.5
332," Miles, who is Paul Giamatti's character in ""Sideways,"" is middle-aged and reports, despondently, that the best part of his life isover.  He has only his love of wine to keep him going.  Fairenough: but what would you think of a guy who thinks that life isessentially over after the age of 12: who advises kids of that agenot to go to sleep because they will only wake up a day older? Such is the philosophy that drives James M. Barrie (JohnnyDepp), who is unhappily married and whose affections aredisplayed when he is around kids.  A group of such children inspire him to write a breakthrough play ""Peter Pan"" in 1904, thefirst such fantasy ever mounted on the London stage strictly forchildren and for the young in heart.  With a performance by Johnny Depp that can sweep adults offtheir feet, ""Finding Neverland"" is Marc Forster's fictionalizedbiopic of J.M. Barrie from a script by David Magee which was inturn adapted from Allen Knee's play ""The Man Who Was PeterPan.""  Roberto Schaefer, who photographs London at the turn of thetwentieth century, concentrates on the city's sophisticates--thetheatergoers who come from the upper reaches of a societyinformed by Victorian manners and manors.  Even the orphanswho are comped to an opening night production of Barrie's""Peter Pan"" are polite, well-dressed, and happy.  Barrie himself has a reputation as a distinguished playwrightwhose works are not always cheered by London critics, but he isregularly backed by producer Charles Frohman (DustinHoffman) whose complaints about the large amounts of moneyhe sinks into each attempt to absorb the tuxedo-clad crowds incentral London are belied by his trust and faith in his writer'spotential.  Depp, whose adopted Scottish brogue is surprisinglyunderstandable by an American movie audience, is portrayedas a man without children of his own, one who neglects hispretty wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell) despite the advantage of theopulent home where he and Mary are served by two maids.  Hefeels more comfortable around his Newfoundland dog, Porthos,with whom he plays by casting a ball attached to a fishing rod.While in the park one day, he comes upon four young lads withtheir widowed mother, Sylvia (Kate Winslet). When he cavortswith his dog while telling the children that the animal is adancing bear, he shows more imagination than the children,who insist that the ""bear"" is ""just a dog.""  At this point directorMarc Forster pulls off the first of surreal images, the best ofwhich will conclude the story, by juxtaposing the scene in thepark with a full-scale circus ring complete with animals andclowns.  He ""adopts,"" or is adopted, by this new family withwhom he shares time that otherwise would have been spendwith his wife, Mary.  ""Finding Neverland"" never descends into either a MasterpieceTheatre version, too lofty to be appreciate by any kids who willturn out for this PG-rated film, or a dull biopic.  Forster avoids aliteral interpretation of Barrie's life with his new family, castinghis eye in part on the children's overly rigid grandmother, Mrs.Emma Du Maurier (Julie Christie), whom Barrie imagines as thevillainous pirate of his masterwork, ""Peter Pan.""  A particularlysweet, but not cloying, performance is turned in by young(Freddie Highmore) in the role of Peter, who appears to beBarrie' favorite and the chap who inspires the play.  When aftera victorious opening night of the play, a theatergoer, introducedto the eight-year-old, remarks, ""You're Peter Pan,"" the boy,without skipping a beat, corrects her: ""He's Peter,"" he says,pointing at Barrie, whose relationship with his wife is so cold thatwe wonder whether he'll be able to relate to his ""children"" whenthey advance in age. ",Finding Neverland,PG,2004,2.5
333," The mechanics of a film like 'Firestorm' are pretty basic.  It isn'tlike you would expect a brainstorm of ideas to revolve around such asimple and mundane premise.  Therefore, you have to count on the filmhaving a well executed blend of stunt work, editing, photographicexpertise, and it should, at the very least, have a brisk pace.'Firestorm' doesn't have any of these elements in the proper place.  Ina somewhat shameless and pitiful way, it passes itself off with thetrademark elements of a television movie.  The shaky camera angles, anobviously low number of takes, murky photography and cheesy specialeffects are all presented in a protracted and scattershot manner andmany of the movie's bland action sequences are clumsily executed andin a movie involving fire, you almost need a magnifying glass to see anyof the important moments.  Former NFL celebrity and present day football analyst Howie Long stars(barely) as a wilderness firefighter who confronts a renegade group ofescaped prisoners, disguised as firefighters, who are using a forestfire as the perfect cover for a getaway scheme involving the recovery ofmillions of dollars hidden away just before their leader was caught andsent away to prison.  William Forsythe plays the villain leader (barely) who enlists the aidof other prisoners to help him recover the money but kills each one ofhis helpers along the way so he doesn't have to share the loot withthem.  Tagging along for the ride is a nature photographer (Suzi Amis)who becomes embroiled in Long's fight against the bad guys after Longrescues her from Forsythe's gang after she's kidnapped and tells Longduring their hike through the forest that she's the daughter of atough marine and learned a lot from her old man.  Where's theincredible hulk when you need him?  Rounding out the cast is the veteranactor Scott Glenn who is completely wasted as a colleague of Long's inthe fire fighting game who suffers a career ending injury and has tomake an embarrassing sacrifice during the film's climax.  'Firestorm' is unbelievably anaemic and has some of the worst computerenhanced gimmicks so far in the technology of motion pictures.  It'scredibility is strained by so many phony fire related elements thatyou'll wish you had a little device with you that's marked ""break glassin the event of boredom"".  There are countless scenes where some of thecast members would have become overcome by smoke inhalation and diedlong before they get out of their entanglements and other scenes thatdepict debris landing on them, in front of them and around them wouldhave been equally fatal in a real scenario. ",Firestorm,R,1998,0.5

335," Forest Whitaker's FIRST DAUGHTER, a poor little rich girl story about thePresident's college-age daughter, is an exceedingly lame teen comedy bereft ofgenuine moments.  The plastic characters are so unbelievable and saccharinethat an urge came over me while watching it.  I was desperate to escape for abreath of real, fresh air.  Katie Holmes, as the eponymous star of the film, may be cute, but her movienever is.  The overwhelmingly oppressive and sugary music kept telling me whata swell time I was having, even as I felt like I was about to gag.  From the first moment, the film acts like it is a whimsical fairy tale that wassupposed to star Hilary Duff.  Well, Holmes is no Duff, which isn't necessarilya bad thing.  But this movie never finds a tone that works.  Michael Keaton andMargaret Colin play Samantha ""Sam"" Mackenzie's parents, also know as the leaderof the free world and his wife or the President and the First Lady.  The story gets in gear with just plain Sam arriving in a long black limo paradeat her first day in college, 3,000 miles away from home.  The brass band greetsher and her family with ""Hail To The Chief.""  No sooner has she arrived thather new roommate, Mia (Amerie Rogers in a pathetic performance),unrealistically insults her and then just as unbelievably turns into an instantbosom buddy.  Her large Secret Service detail is at first overwhelming and thenlater is usually completely AWOL.  Or is it?  The only good thing about FIRST DAUGHTER is that it makes you want toreevaluate the bland CHASING LIBERTY, the Mandy Moore movie about thepresident's daughter, which was originally scheduled to open opposite FIRSTDAUGHTER until FIRST DAUGHTER blinked and moved its release forward by almostnine months.  After seeing FIRST DAUGHTER, CHASING LIBERTY looks really goodnow in comparison.  FIRST DAUGHTER runs a painfully long 1:44.

336,"      From the writer (Tim Kelleher) who is bringing the controversialCD-ROM game LEISURE SUIT LARRY to the big screen, we have a movie aboutthe FIRST KID, a. k. a., the son of the president.  I found thetrailers for the movie pretty lame so I was not looking forward toseeing the film.  My son, Jeffrey (age 7), on the other hand, thoughtthe trailers were a hoot and kept asking when it was going to start sowe saw it on opening day.       Although most of the jokes fall flat, FIRST KID is not without itscharms.  In fact, as the movie developed I begin to like parts of it,most especially the acting by Sinbad as the First Kid's Secret ServiceAgent known formally as Agent Sam Simms and informally as Agent DoubleO Simms.  The quality of the script is quite low, but Sinbad played thecharacter with great panache as if he had just been given the best roleof the year.  It is so refreshing to see actors try so hard.  Toooften, see Val Kilmer in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU for example, actorsjust brood and seem angry that the director expects them to do morethan just show up on the set.       As the story starts, First Lady Linda Davenport (Lisa Eichhorn)and 13-year-old First Kid Luke Davenport (Brock Pierce from THE MIGHTYDUCKS series) are making their annual shopping trip to the mall todemonstrate to America that they are average working stiffs likeeveryone else.  The First Lady even remarks to the reporters how she isessentially a working woman.  Like all of us working stiffs, the familyarrives in a long limousine with a phalanx of bodyguards.  The FirstKid hates his life and moons the herd of reporters that follow them inthe mall.       The First Lady does not like the way Agent Woods (Timothy Busfieldfrom ""thirtysomething"") touches her son so she demands a new agent forher son's protection.  Always in trouble Agent Simms is assigned to thekid.  He becomes Luke's friend by helping him escape frequently fromThe White House.       In an absolutely predictable show, Simms warns Luke when he issurfing the net that, ""Just be careful out there in Cyberspace.  Don'ttell them anything.""  This of course, serves to scare overly cautiousparents that The Net is the enemy.  Personally, I'd worry more in theparking lot when I leave the theater.       I have some problems with the appropriateness of parts of script.One of the early jokes, albeit one aimed at the adults, has Simmstelling the bartender, ""I'll have a Harvey Wall-Banger.""  Agent Woodsone ups him with, ""I'll have a Harvey Oswald.""  Confused, Simms asks,""What's the difference?""  Agent Woods gives him a devious smileretorting, ""Oswald has three shots.""  Remember, these are agents swornto guard the lives of the President and his family.  Actually, the jokeis nothing more than a plot device so the writer can telegraph theending.       Brock Pierce starts off giving nothing to the role of First Kid,and even by the end, he warms up maybe to mediocrity.  Even worse isJames Naughton as the president.  He is terribly miscast.  He looks andacts like, well, a mayor of a small town - one who spends his daysselling insurance.  Never, is he believable as a president of anythingmore than the local Elks Club.       Soon the First Son goes to school and the local bully, Rob(Zachery Ty Bryan), taunts him with ""I knew it.  A wus just like hisdad, the draft dodger.""  They get into a fist fight where Luke gets abusted and bloody lip while Agent Simms just watches.  Sure.       The script tries to get us feeling sorry for Luke since he has nofriends.  Simms approach is to teach the kid boxing at a gym so he canbeat up the bully.  Again, back to my concern about some of themessages of the show.  Nevertheless, there are some funny scenes at thegym and elsewhere.       The three best scenes in the show are the one where Luke asks agirl to a dance, where Simms shoots an extra large spitball in class atthe bully, and where President Clinton calls on the videophone to askPresident Davenport to look for his lost saxophone.  My favorite minorcharacter is Luke's girlfriend Katie (Erin Williby).  She is sweet andinnocent, and she charms every scene she is in.  An impressive screenpresence for such a minor part.       Finally, I feel a warning is necessary about the ending.  Givenhow innocuous most of the film is, I was kind of shocked by the ending.We have a child kidnapping scene complete with real guns, a very scaredchild, slightly bloody violence, a realistic shoot-out, and a manapparently and realistically shot dead.  If your kids worry about beingabducted, this could push them over the edge.  Now, Jeffrey was notscared, but I bet many kids, especially younger ones, are and somecould be very frightened.       FIRST KID runs too long at 1:41.  Editing out of the slow parts byeditor Harry Keramidas would have helped a lot.  The film is rated PG.The language is pretty mild, and there is no sex or nudity, but notethe previous warnings about the violence.  Jeffrey gives it threethumbs up.  Although I laughed some, there is not enough there for meto be able to recommend it.  No matter how much energy Sinbad threwinto his role, director David M. Evans could not get much out of theother actors so I can only give it * 1/2. ",First Kid,PG,1996,1.5
337,"      Middle age actresses Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keatonget together for a fun romp.  In an age where many actors brood on theset and look angry that they have to come out of the confines of theirtrailers, here we have some acting pros who have a blast hamming it uptogether.  The result is not a great comedy, but a serviceable one thatprovides some nice laughs and easy to enjoy entertainment.       THE FIRST WIVES CLUB tells a story of woe from the perspectives ofthe injured first wives who have been dumped for younger models.  Itsmotto can be summed up in the words of Ivana Trump, who shows up asherself and advises the first wives, ""Ladies, you have to be strong andindependent, and remember, don't get mad, get everything.""  Althoughsome men may tire quickly of the constant male bashing, the charactersare all such comedic stereotypes that I never minded.       Three friends from the college graduating class of 1969 (my classI should point out), Elise Elliot Atchison (Goldie Hawn), BrendaMorelli Cushman (Bette Midler), and Annie MacDuggan Paradis (DianeKeaton) learn that their friend and ex-student Cynthia Swann Griffin(Stockard Channing) has committed suicide because of her first husband.They are all shocked.  As Elise puts it, ""If only she'd called me.  Ifonly I was listed.""       After the funeral they get together for a drunken luncheon wherethey share their sad tales of their first husbands and finish eachothers lines.  Elise says that, ""when men get to be a certain age,"" andBrenda concludes, ""good-bye women, hello Pop Tarts.""       Each of the characters is unique and yet strikingly similar.Elise is an Academy-Award winning actress with tons of makeup andmonster sized lips.  As her plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman (RobReiner) warns her about her request for another lip operation, ""If Igive you any more collagen, they'll look like they were stuck in a pooldrain.""  Elise believes in her medical miracles and advises her friendsthat, ""It's the 90s, plastic surgery is like good grooming.""  In caseyou haven't already guessed, every character in the show seemsenormously wealthy.       Keaton, playing out of character for her, does a nice job as awhiny woman who can not express anger.  A real wimp and with a bossymother, Catherine (Eileen Heckart), to boot.  When Annie tells hermother about her therapist, her mother informs her, ""You are married.You have a daughter.  You don't need self-esteem.""       Although this is the three star's movie, the secondary cast hasfun too.  Sarah Jessica Parker plays Brenda's husband's, Morton (DanHedaya), sexy new girlfriend Shelly Stewart.  Shelly's brain is inproportion to the rest of svelte figure.  Brenda greets her with, ""Lookat you.  My, my, the bulimia sure has paid off.""       Director Hugh Wilson and writer Robert Harling (based on a novelby Olivia Goldsmith) combine witty dialog with a little physical humor.Too often broad comedies like this dissolve into slapstick.  Here thehumor is mainly in the lines which are the best part of the show.       The husbands are complete cads without an ounce of compassion.Annie's estranged husband Aaron (Stephen Collins) takes her to bed onelast time before popping the question to her, ""I want a divorce.""Okay, so it's not exactly a question.       All of this is merely the setup.  The movie is about a club theyform to torment their ex's and take all of their money.  Half is notenough for the misery inflicted on them by being dumped for someone ""inpreschool"" as Brenda phrases it.  The husbands don't fight back andonly grumble.  Elise's husband Bill (Victor Garber) screams at her withthe epithet, ""You vindictive sack of silicone!""       Most of the picture is about the antics of the club.  The showtacks on a mildly serious ending that attempts to cast the show ashaving a message about spousal abuse.  The ending has no place in acomedy and only dulls the comedy and insults the message.  At the verylast, the women start singing their theme song, ""You don't own.  Don'ttry to change me in anyway.""  This is one of the happiest musicalnumbers I have seen in the cinema in a long time.  What fun these threehad doing this film.       THE FIRST WIVES CLUB runs 1:42.  It is just rated PG since thereis no sex, nudity, violence, or bad language.  Given the theme of thecomedy a kid would probably have to be nine or so to appreciate it.Younger kids would also be in danger of taking the male bashing tooseriously.  I give the film a thumbs up and award it ** 1/2. ",First Wives Club,PG,1996,2.5

339," In writer/director Jeremy Podeswa's mesmerizing THE FIVE SENSES, Rona(Mary-Louise Parker from GRAND CANYON) has a small problem -- animpaired sense of taste.  A baker who creates marvelous-looking butincredibly-bland cakes, Rona hasn't a clue as to how to create flavor.Her taste in boyfriends is also questionable.  While on vacation she metan Italian hunk, Roberto (Marco Leonardi), and invited him home.  Thisnon-English speaker has ensconced himself in her apartment, and sheworries that she'll never get him out.  Still, the sex is good, and,being a great cook, he feeds her well so she is perplexed about what todo.  This is one of many overlapping stories in THE FIVE SENSES.  Each ofthem involves one of the five human senses in some way.  Using this plotgimmick, Podeswa, an extremely gifted writer and director, never letsthe limitations of the setup confine the bounds of his storytelling.The beauty of the story is that no matter how much we learn about eachcharacter, we are compelled to discover even more.  Most writersintroduce a dozen main characters only to the detriment of narrativeclarity, but Podeswa manages to create complex characterization withinthe bounds of minimal screen time.  His movie calls to mind LawrenceKasdan's GRAND CANYON in the depth of its characterization.  THE FIVE SENSES in tone most reminds one of another Canadian film, THESWEET HEREAFTER, but THE FIVE SENSES mixes comedy and romance with itstragedies.  The deliberate and successful slow pacing works in bothpictures, whereas slowness is usually cinematic death for a film.  The story that glues the others together concerns the disappearance of a4-year-old girl, Amy Lee.  One day at the massage therapist, Ruth(Gabrielle Rose), Anna (Molly Parker from KISSED) finds that Amy Lee isbored.  Ruth asks her very reluctant teenage daughter, Rachel (NadiaLitz), to take Amy Lee to the park across the street to play.  Rachel is a sullen, unhappy kid with a lot of repressed anger.  A16-year-old high school dropout, she looks like a character straightfrom THE ICE STORM.   She voyeurs life like a stranger from her nerdyglasses.  While in charge of Amy Lee, Rachel wanders off to observelovers in the park, and when she returns, her little charge is gone.Rachel feels terrible about it but stuffs her feelings as deep as shecan.  Only another outsider about her age, Rupert (Brendan Fletcher),can understand something of her angst, causing them to develop a strangebond.  In the same building as Ruth is an eye-doctor, Richard (PhilippeVolter), who is going deaf.  He becomes an audio voyeur and beginsmaking a list of those sounds that he wants to listen to before hishearing goes.  His character is reminiscent of the one from LAST NIGHTwho had a long list of activities that he wanted to engage in before theworld ended.   Gail (Pascale Bussieres), a paid ""escort"" and sympatheticperson, helps him in his quest.  The most interesting and unusual character is that of Robert (DanielMacIvor), Rona's bisexual house cleaner, who has a remarkable gift ofsmell.  Robert is on a quest to smell all of his previous lovers to seeif any of them still love him.  He explains that he can smell love andthat he actually would not call his acquaintances ""lovers"" since hedoesn't think any of them really loved him.  Robert and Rona, one of hisex-flings, mentor each other in the ways of love.  He is especially fullof advice for her, most of which she agrees with but ignores anyway.  Robert is a funny, friendly guy, who is light-years away from theclich_s we are normally presented with as gay people.  His search hasthe same bittersweet tone as the rest of the movie, but his characterworks so hard to be happy that we could vote him ""Most Wanting toSucceed.""  We root for him all the way even when it seems that no oneappreciates him as they should.  (He's also one of the best and happiesthouse cleaners you've ever met.)  The hauntingly beautiful music by composers Alexina Louie and Alex Paukperfectly captures and enhances the mood of the film.  Full of strings,wind instruments and dreamy voices, the score is striking in itsemotional impact on the film and lovely on its own.  Eventually, the stories wrap up quite satisfactorily but without anyunnatural convergences or actions.  Like GRAND CANYON, you are leftwanting to know more about what happens to your newly-made friends afterthe three days covered in the narrative.  Podeswa doesn't insult yourintelligence by providing some cheap epilogue.  He leaves you free touse your imagination to decide how the rest of their lives turn out.  THE FIVE SENSES runs 1:44.  It is rated R for sexuality and language andwould be acceptable for teenagers. ",Five Senses,R,2000,3.5
340," More aptly titled DOA, were that name not already taken, FLAWLESS is anunappealing mess of a movie.  Written and directed by Joel Schumacher,whose last film was the sleazy 8MM, the movie has tonal problems fromits gangster beginning to its madcap mayhem ending.  Sometimes it wantsto be a gay comedy, other times it wants to pull your heart strings andstill other times it wants to shock you with Schumacher's signatureviolence.  No matter what it tries, it rarely succeeds.  Best described as acomedic tragedy, the movie ladles on lots of attempted humor.  It is thesort of movie that has one person -- in our audience it was the same oneperson -- laughing loudly and frequently, as the rest of the viewerswatch stoically.  The story concerns the awkward friendship between a depressed,homophobic, stroke-victim, Walt Koontz (Robert De Niro), and an unhappytransvestite, Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who wants to bea woman as soon as he can get the money.  Besides the tens of thousandsof dollars for the sex change operation itself, he also requires $28,000for ""extensive psychological testing"" before the operation.  ""I'm lonely; I'm ugly; I'm a drag queen,"" Rusty concisely summarizes hisview of his life.  Although he tries to act tough (""I left sensitivityback in the sand pile""), he lets himself get pushed around.  Waltbegrudgingly comes to Rusty to get singing lessons as a form of speechtherapy.  De Niro, turning in one of his most uninteresting performancesever, accurately portrays the speech patterns of his character butforgets to give him any life.  The entire movie features labored actingwhose presentation has the dullness of an old knife.  Although Daniel Orlandi's costumes are colorful, Declan Quinn destroystheir effect with his grim and ugly cinematography -- more of the film'stonal problems.  Schumacher, who also gave us the abysmal BATMAN &ROBIN, can't seem to make up his mind whether he wants to make LA CAGEAUX FOLLES or SEVEN.   Whenever he throws in something fun, like thecontrast between the conservatively-suited gay Republicans and theflamboyant cross-dressers, Schumacher feels compelled to destroy themoment.  Rather that just enjoy the visual delights of the situation, hewrites Rusty a diatribe against all Republicans, even gay ones.  There are also subplots about the search for a mobster's missing moneyand about Walt's search for unpaid female companionship.  None of thismakes any difference because Schumacher's narrative, or lack thereof,can't sustain the viewer's interest.  There is no genuine chemistrybetween the two leads, and the movie never comes close to jelling.  FLAWLESS runs 1:50.  It is rated R for pervasive language and strongviolence and would be acceptable for older teenagers. ",Flawless,R,1999,1.5
341,"      Director Kevin Hooks's FLED is a fast action movie that appears tobe about two convicts on the lam, but is actually a highly contrivedand ridiculous conspiracy on top of conspiracy plot.  This is one ofthe those movies that requires you to check your brain in the lobby.Don't even try to count the implausibilities in Preston Whitmore'sscript.       What saves the film is two fine pieces of acting by its stars,Laurence Fishburne as Piper and Stephen Baldwin as Luke Dodge plus theexcellent performance by Wil Patton as the southern good old boy andsmartest cop of all Matthew Gibson.  FLED is needlessly violent aswell, but all of this notwithstanding, I liked the show as did theaudience.  A fast paced bit of entertainment that will make you laugh,sometimes when you are not supposed to, and will pump up youradrenaline.       As the show starts, a witness who is to testify against FrankMantajano, the head of the Cuban Mafia, is killed thus causing theSenate investigating committee to be without its star witness.  Theshow quickly shifts to a chain gang in Georgia where new convict Dodgeand old hand Piper escape while chained to each other's wrists.  SoonU. S. Marshall Schiller appears out of nowhere and kills anotherescapee with his hands up trying to surrender.  It seems there are bigconspiracies brewing, and Schiller, among others, is involved.  OfficerGibson is the only one that can see the obvious so he follows the""good"" guys and the bad.       The reason for all of the chasing is that Dodge hacked into thecomputer of Brigantine International.  This is okay because hedetermined that the company was greedy.  Moreover he stole $25,000,000and gave $20,000,000 of it to charity.  He explains all of this toPiper and tells him, ""On the Internet my code name is CyberThug.""       The show is quite funny.  One small thing that is fun is that whenthey get in a jam, one will say to the other, ""didn't you see"" and thenname some movie title as if all knowledge is found in some movie.Among movies so referenced were: THE GODFATHER, DELIVERANCE, THEFUGITIVE, and SHAFT.       My favorite character is the wise but unassuming Officer Gibson,whose accent is so thick you could cut it with a knife.  He reminded mea lot of the pregnant lead detective in FARGO.  Gibson advisesSchiller, ""I think you are just spitting in the wind, and you know whatthey say about spitting in the wind.  It may blow back in your face.""       The chemistry between the two leads is quite good.  I thinkLaurence Fishburne is a great talent, and it showed here.  Without him,I don't think they would of had a show, but they do have him and so forme it worked.       Which scene did the audience like the least?  Baldwin's lovemaking scene! It is so overdone and with such cliches, i.e., done infront of a roaring fire, that they were laughing at it, and it is notsupposed to be funny.  When the Piper and his girlfriend, Cora, wellplayed by Salma Hayek, have an erotic bread kneading scene, it worksmuch better.       Let me not dwell on this implausibility thing, and rather than getinto the intricate conspiracy maze, let me give two small examples.  Ifyou were being chased by people with big guns and helicopters while youwere chained to a large man who was running with you, would you keeptrying to knock him out and thereby run the risk of having to run whiledragging him?  Also, why is all the key data stored one little floppyand without any duplicate?  I could go on, but I will not.  I was ableto put my brain in neutral so perhaps you will be able to as well, andthis stuff not bother you.       FLED runs a little over an hour and a half.  It will certainly bean R for sex, nudity, and most of all gory violence of the type wheremany people die with large bullet holes and blood spurting everywhere.It would be probably be okay for teenagers if they are mature.  I hatedthe story, but I had a good time, laughed some, and liked the acting,except for pathetic overacting by Schiller and the whole Cuban Mafiacrowd, so I am giving it a thumbs up and rating it ** 1/2. ",Fled,R,1996,2.5
342,"Hey, if George Lucas can do a ""Star Wars"" prequel, why notThe Flintstones?  This prehistoric, live-action prequel goes back tothe bachelor days of Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy) and Barney Rubble(Stephen Baldwin), showing how they court and marry Wilma Slaghoople(Kristen Johnston) and her room-mate, Betty O'Shale (Jane Krakowski),respectively. It turns out that curvaceous Wilma's the daughter ofdoddering Col. Slaghoople (Harvey Korman) and snooty, snobbish PearlSlaghoople (Joan Collins) who want her to marry Chip Rockefeller(Thomas Gibson), the suave, sneaky scion of a respectable old-moneyfamily who wants to use the Slaghoople fortune to pay off a mobdebt. But Wilma loves blue-collar Fred, who has just secured a job atthe rock quarry in Bedrock. Chip invites everyone, including Fred andBarney, to be his guests at the opening of a new resort hotel in RockVegas.  Based on the animated Hanna-Barbera TV series, thecollaborative screenplay, credited to four writers, utilizes everyknown prehistoric cliche, while Brian Levant's direction desperatelyunderscores each sight gag and pun. Alan Cumming plays two roles: TheGreat Gazoo, a tiny, wisecracking alien who was sent to Earth toobserve the mating rituals of humans, and Mick Jagged, one of Betty'ssuitors, while Ann-Margret warbles on the soundtrack.  Problem is:it's too talky for kids - they get really restless - and too tacky foradults. At 90 minutes, it seems excruciatingly long. On the GrangerMovie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" is anexaggerated, frantic, cornball 3.

343,"These days, we are witnessing the deluge of films based onold, cult TV shows. Most of the times, the fans of theseshows shudder thinking what could Hollywood hacks of thepresent do with the memories of their past. But, some fiveor six years ago, there weren't that many movies and thetrend didn't look that depressing. So, the people who, likethe author of this review, grew up watching FLINTSTONES,popular 1960s animated series about ""modern Stone Age""family, weren't particularly worried when the word cameabout live action remake. After all, the producer behind theproject was Steven Spielberg and, if anything else, at leastthe special effects would be good.  The plot revolves about Flintstones, family set in fictiousStone Age ""town"" of Bedrock, whose members enjoy thelifestyle of 1950s middle class America. Fred Flinstone(John Goodman) works in the quarry, and one day he helps hisbest friend and neighbour Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) andhis wife Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) to adopt a baby. To returnthe favour, Barney switches his results of aptitude testwith Fred, and, based on that, Fred gets well-paid job inmanagement. But, of course, this is just a sham - corruptofficial Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and his sultrysecretary Sharon Stone (Halle Berry) need a scapegoat fortheir embezzlement scheme. In the meantime, Fred's wifeWilma (Elizabeth Perkins) must face her mother (ElizabethTaylor) who can't stand Fred.  On the superficial level, THE FLINTSTONES did the excellentjob in bringing the animated series to life. Computereffects are flawless, and the costumes, settings and otherdetails are authentic for all the fans of the show.Unfortunately, problems with this film start with inadequatecasting - Rick Moranis is too thin for the role of Barney,while the cartoon Betty used to be much skinnier than RosieO'Donnell. But the greatest problem of all is plot, or to beprecise, the lack of plot. Some thirty six screenwritersmade sure that the plot of the film is lame, originalcharacters one-dimensional, and many elements of the story,like embezzlement and inter-office politics, totallyincomprehensible for the little children, the main targetedaudience of this film. Result is almost unwatchable mess,occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting (ElizabethPerkins was right on mark as Wilma) and one of the classicexample of mortal Hollywood disease known as ""high concept"".After great hype, movie quickly sank into oblivion and thefans of the show returned to the animated version. All inall, film isn't that bad, but only the hard core fans andnostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it. ","Flintstones, The",PG,1994,1
344,"      FLIRTING WITH DISASTER is a movie that constants flirts withdisaster.  It plays like a low budget experimental comedy wherescreenwriter and director David O. Russell throws everything he caninto the script as if this is his only chance ever to make a comedy.You may remember him from his only other film, SPANKING THE MONKEY,which he wrote and directed.  That film is a serious, moving, andshockingly frank look at incest, and is also a much better movie.  Some people incorrectly labelled that picture as a comedy.  It wasn't.       All of the above notwithstanding, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER hadenough big laughs that I did like it.  When people ask me how I manageto take such great photographs, I tell them my secret is compositionand quantity.  Russell used my later technique.  If you put enoughjokes in and you are raunchy and experimental enough, some are bound tohit the mark.  A lot of the movie is in bad taste; some jokes fall likea stone; but, the ones that work are great.       The movie is about Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) embarking on a journeyto find his real parents since he feels he can not name his four monthold son until he meets his real parents.  He is accompanied on the tripby his beautiful wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette) and an even morebeautiful doctor-in-training from his adoption agency, Tina Kalb (TeaLeoni).  His adoptive parents are played by Mary Tyler Moore and GeorgeSegal.       As an example of the crudeness of the script, the movie startswith Nancy having sex with Mel while he protests since he is holdingtheir baby.  In an embarrassing scene, Mary Tyler Moore raises herblouse to show a living room full of people how a strong bra is hertrick to keeping a good figure.  There are other examples that are hardto describe in a G rated review of an R rated movie.       The mother can not understand Mel's motivation so she asks, ""Whydoes he have to do the Roots thing?  Aren't we good enough parents?""The running joke in the movie is that they go on a series of wild goosechases where they find people who turn out not to be Mel's real parentsafterall.  The first jaunt is to take them to San Diego, but they arewarned by Mel's adoptive father that, ""San Diego has a big carjackingproblem.  They bump you, and when you stop, they mutilate you.""  Hisfirst ""real"" mom, Valerie Swaney, is sweet but strange and full ofstrange little homilies.  She tells Mel when he breaks her prizedpossession that, ""All children break things.  All children areforgiven.  It's a gift from God.""       His first ""real"" dad tries to teach him how to drive a big rig.Mel manages to smash a small post office with the truck.  Two gayagents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms show up.  AgentTony (Josh Brolin) is bisexual and an old high school boyfriend ofNancy's.  The sterner Agent Paul (Richard Jenkins) tells Mel, ""You doknow it is a federal offense to destroy a United States Post Office?""       Most of the show has the five of them, Mel, Nancy, Tina, Paul, andTony on a road trip to find Mel's actual real parents played by LilyTomlin and Alan Alda along with his brother played by Glenn Fitzgerald.At the start they rent two cars and as they try to find their cars in asea of identical Budget rental cars, Nancy reflects, ""Does anybodyactually own a white Taurus or are they all rentals?""  My favoritescene in the movie is an indescribable sight gag that happens after Meland Tina almost get it on at a B & B where they are all staying.       Poor Mary Tyler Moore is pathetic in the film and looks like sheis suffering from extreme sleep depravation.  George Seagal is not muchbetter, and they are both embarrassments.  The other actors andactresses do fine, but nothing special.  The relative success of thepicture rises and falls with the undulations of the script.  With lineslike Lily Tomlin's, ""We love you very much.  If you were JeffreyDahlmer, we would still love you"" or Tony's, ""Do you mind if I take alook at your armpits?  I think armpits are the prettiest part of awoman's body,"" the audience is in stitches.  I am sad to report that alot of the movie had me with my mouth hanging open going ""huh?"" as manyattempts were duds.       FLIRTING WITH DISASTER runs a fast 1:30.  It is rated R forfrequent sex, constant and very explicit sexual language, and an LSDdrug usage scene.  There is no nudity or violence.  I think the filmwould be okay for most teenagers, but no one younger.  I hate to sayit, but many parents in my audience brought kids from ages 4-10 yearsold.  This bizarre show is not for everyone, but I liked it and am gladI saw it.  If you like quirky sexual comedies, I recommend this film;otherwise, don't waste your time.  If you do go, stay through all ofthe credits and watch the even more bizarre outtakes.  I give thisfunny, but highly uneven film ** 1/2. ",Flirting With Disaster,R,1996,2.5
345,"Eyeglasses.  That's all it took to change Lawrence Newman's life, a new pairof round, black, horn rimmed eyeglasses with coke bottle lenses that madehis eyes look like fish eyes.  With these, he was instantly and incorrectlylabeled as Jewish in the mid-1940s when anti-Semitism was running rampant ina Norman Rockwell America. The problems and strengths of Neal Slavin's FOCUS are immediately obvious.The colorful sets and cinematography possess a PLEASANTVILLE-like lushness.The acting by William H. Macy as Lawrence and Laura Dern as Lawrence's wife,Gertrude, is superb, the directing is precise and the production isgorgeous.  Kendrew Lascelles's script, however, which is based on an ArthurMiller novel, feels rather like one long Sunday school lesson.  Make nomistake, the anti-racism theme is a good one, but the constantly moralizingstory could use some nuance.  The world in it is too neatly dichotomizedinto the prejudiced, which is just about everyone, and those few beingdiscriminated against. As the movie opens, Lawrence is working as the head of personnel at anoffice building.  He spends his days in a raised, windowed office thatoverlooks a sea of typists.  After he makes the mistake of choosing theglasses that supposedly make him look Jewish -- I think they make him lookintellectual -- he is demoted to the position of clerk, so he quits.Although he fights the discrimination tooth and nail by denying he's Jewish,he never considers a simple change of eyewear as an easy solution. Gertrude is a stunningly good looking blonde with a short, tight-fittingskirt and exaggerated sexy walk who comes to interview with Lawrence.Before they've even had their first date, she asks him to marry her.   Thescript always seems in a rush to get to the next morality lesson, leaving itlittle time for character development outside the main storyline. Lawrence's neighbor Fred (Meat Loaf Aday) alerts him to the trouble brewingin their neighborhood.  It seems that Jews are moving in.  Unless they stopit, it will be Jews today and blacks tomorrow.  ""It's our neighborhood,""Fred admonishes him sternly.  ""We've got to keep it that way."" Why FOCUS felt it had to be so didactic is a mystery.  It's a fine moviewith a good message, which partially self-destructs by constantly trying tobeat its message into our heads. FOCUS runs 1:48.  It is rated PG-13 for ""thematic material, violence andsome sexual content"" and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.",Focus,PG-13,2001,2.5
346,"Among the ranks of 50's science-fiction movies, FORBIDDEN PLANET is considered to be one of the best, which makes me more determined than ever to stay away from the other ones. You can tell from the first minute what quality entertainment the movie holds, as a giant pie-plate flying saucer on a string flies by and the narrator tells us that, by the year 2200, space colonization will have spread out to other solar systems.          That's where Captain Adams (Leslie Nielson) and his crew come in. They've been sent out to check on a mission that hasn't been heard from in twenty years. And when they get to the atmosphere of this coincidentally Earth-like planet, a voice on the radio warns them to stay away. They don't, of course, landing the pie plate to find a giant robot waddling toward them. It's Robbie the Robot (""As Himself,"" the opening credits inform us), who looks like a giant jukebox with human legs. ""Do you speak English?"" Robbie asks them. ""If not, I speak over 187 languages and their various dialects and subtexts."" A stone-faced Nielson replies, ""Colloquial English will do just fine, thank you.""          Robbie leads them to his master, the morbid Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), the only inhabitant of the planet. Or is he? Out walks his beautiful daughter, Alta (Anne Francis), who was born during the one year timeframe before some mysterious, unseen force killed off all the colonists except for Pidgeon, who was ""immune."" Now he and his daughter are living with the robot, who does all the housework, can create any substance and has the strength to topple a house.          No, he's not a dangerous monster that's going to terrorize the crew (that comes later), he has a ""built-in safety device"" that prevents him from killing people. Morbius demonstrates by asking Nielson if he can borrow ""that formidable-looking sidearm of yours"" and ordering Robbie to shoot Nielson with it, an order the robot cannot compute. Seems like an amazing piece of machinery, right? But, as Morbius tells Nielson and his space crew, ""Don't attribute feeling to him, gentlemen. Robbie is simply a tool."" With no men on the island for Alta to chase after, you have to wonder if that last phrase has more than one meaning.           Don't think me a pervert, because we're given more than ample evidence that Alta is sex-starved. When she sees Nielson's men, she announces seductively, ""You're lovely."" And the feeling is more than mutual, as the Lieutenant replies, ""From over here, the view looks like heaven,"" right in front of her father. (Lucky for him Morbius can't order the robot to shoot him with the formidable-looking sidearm.)          The subplot involving Alta's naivete involving men and the men's innate horniness involving her continues for a while, as the bad Lieutenant gets her to kiss him under the pretense that it's a healthy Earth custom, after which she says, ""There must be something seriously the matter with me because I haven't noticed the least bit of stimulation,"" quite an ego blow to the poor Lieutenant.          It's Nielson she has the hots for, which she realizes after he chews her out for putting all his men in such a sorry state. ""I am in command of eighteen competitively-selected, super-perfect physical specimens with an average age of 24.6 who have been locked up for 376 days,"" he bellows, ordering her to put on something a little less revealing. And apparently, it's not just the humans who are drawn to Alta. She has the wild animals under her control and even Robbie the Robot looks a little flustered after she calls him several times before he finally waddles in, apologizing for his tardiness by admitting, ""I was giving myself an oil job."" What a dipstick.          The movie continues with a predictable revelation -- the planet was once inhabited by an advanced race of people who perfected advanced technologies but were exterminated by that unseen force, which also attacks Nielson and his crew, who shoot back a few animated phasers at it. Throughout the movie, the music score buzzes with other-worldly music that makes even the cheapest Casio keyboards sound symphonic. The special effects are bad even for that time and you already know what the dialogue is like. Suffice it to say, the acting is just as laughable. Leslie Nielson is almost as funny in this serious role as SPY HARD and the NAKED GUN movies combined.  FORBIDDEN PLANET should be forbidden on this planet.",Forbidden Planet,G,1956,1.5
347," Sandra Bullock shines in this frenetic road comedy/love storyabout the shared adventures of two unlikely people thrown together ona cross-country trip. She plays a goofy, mischievous, free-spiritedlady who finds herself seated on a plane next to Ben Affleck, a stolidNew York-based copy-writer. She's going from New York to Savannah,Georgia, to sell a bagel shop and visit her 10 year-old son, whilehe's nervously en route to his wedding there. But, on take-off, theplane's engine inhales a seagull and they never get off theground. So, they have to find other means of transportation to theirshared destination. Think ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" but addbuses and on foot. Patterned on the old Preston Sturges screwballcomedies, the premise works because the characters are genuine andtheir emotional problems are identifiable. You empathize with theirdilemma and growing attraction to one another, even though the twostars definitely lack chemistry together. Director Bronwen Hughes(""Harriet the Spy"") captures the quirky charm of Marc Lawrence'sscript, often using MTV-inspired visuals.  It's too bad that beautifulMaura Tierney, playing Affleck's fiance, keeps losing her Southernaccent, and that the ending takes a detour that may cause somedisapproval.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Forces ofNature"" is an amusing, romantic 6.

348,"      FORGET PARIS is a Billy Crystal movie in the style of one of WoodyAllen's New York Jewish comedies.  Crystal is the lead actor, the producer, the director, and the lead writer (along with Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel).  He is even, briefly, the only singer in the movie.  I can not find the cinematographer's name so for all I know, Billy was behind the camera as well.       FORGET PARIS tells the story of a hard nosed NBA referee calledMickey (Billy Crystal).  He refers to himself as a ""vertically challenged"" individual, but he is not afraid of the redwood tree sized athletes of the NBA.  He looks right up to them and orders them around. In one classic scene, Mickey looses it, and throws every member and coach of both teams out on the game for technical fouls.  If you like the NBA, I don't, you can see all your favorite stars in cameos roles through out the movie although the basketball scenes take up less ten percent of the show.       Nothing intimidates Mickey until he has to go to Paris to bury hisfather and the French airline looses his father's body in baggage handling.  The French representatives of the airline do not care about his complaints.  He lives in the airport for two days complaining to them.  Finally, a middle manager at the airline, an American named Ellen (Debra Winger), takes over his case and awards him the honor of ""passenger of the month"" to make up for all of the troubles they have caused him.  He asks her to show him Paris and the on again, off again romance begins from there.       The whole story of their romance is told in a series of flashbacksby their friends (Julie Kavner, Joe Mantegna, Richard Masur, Cathy Moriarty, John Spencer, etc.) having dinner in New York.  The dinner party is actually quite interesting as well.  It provided the most humorous single line.  Joe Mantegna and his finance are telling how they met.  It seems he FAXed her by accident since he punched one digit wrong.  She then FAXed him back across the country and soon she said ""we were FAXing each other's brains out"".       By far the funniest sequence has to be all of the fertility clinicscenes.  The dialog is uproarious.  I had trouble controlling myself I was laughing so hard.  I got to worrying that I might be offensive to the rest of the audience I was laughing so loud.       All of the above having been said, I am sad to report that themovie was extremely uneven in quality.  Most of the time, it was like a flywheel that kept spinning but engaged only infrequently.  Crystal directed the actors so that they were like detached free agents. Moreover, the script only allocated them funny material at sporadic intervals.  When the scene's should have had strong male bonding, there was none.  The chemistry between Mickey and Ellen was never there so you did not care about them.  Since the movie tried to be both serious and comedic, having no believable relationships was a real problem.The comedy, when it was present, was excellent.  The serious part was non-engaging, dull, and lifeless.       FORGET PARIS runs a quick 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for thefertility clinic scene, but overall, it is a mild PG-13.  There is no nudity or violence, albeit a lot of discussion of sex.  FORGET PARIS, when it worked, made me laugh hard and long so I can easily recommend it to you.  On the other hand, the vast majority of the film had no value other than filling in time before the next joke came along, so I am only awarding it only ** 1/2. ",Forget Paris,PG-13,1995,2.5

Jackson) tones down the hype, telling his prospective buyersthat he has put together a drug made with legal ingredients that,in a combination whose formula is known only by him is fifty-onetimes better than coke, Ecstasy, and amphetamines.  ""Formula51,"" filmed on location in Liverpool, begins with what looks like aone-joke affair (Sam Jackson in a kilt which he wears throughoutthe story) but Mr. Yu melds scripter Stel Pavlou's drug dealers, anassassin, a millionaire businessman, an assortment of skinheadsand a cop on the take into a stunning whole, loaded with laugh-out-loud dialogue, the fast pace that we expect from a directorwhose specialty is martial arts fare, a particularly appealingperformance from Emily Mortimer, an Emily Watson kind of galacting against type, and some remarkable chemistry amongJackson, Robert Carlyle and the aforementioned Mortimer.   ""Formula 51"" has a car chase that reminds us of Jean Reno'sexhibition in ""Ronan"" as Jackson's character, not evenaccustomed to driving on the right side, does just fine pointing aJaguar against traffic.  His Elmo McElroy has the knowledge ofpharmacology to blow up rooms and to implode people's bodies,yielding one scene reminiscent of teen gross-out comedy andanother that transforms a room into a bloody mess.  Stick aroundduring the final credits and you'll find out just why Jackson wearsa kilt and how he uses his golf clubs not only for socking it toskins but for putting on the green. The story opens in 1971 as Elmo McElroy (Samuel L. Jackson),driving in California just after his certification as a pharmacist, isbusted for drug possession thereby losing his ability to practicehis trade.  Obsessed for the next thirty years with a desire to usehis chemical skills for making big bucks, he happens upon aformula for a blue pill that's so powerful that its users can expect apersonal visit from God.  Since the asking price for a mere pieceof paper carrying the formula is twenty mil, rivals compete for theaction, including a grossly evil ""Lizard"" (Meat Loaf) who hiresassassin Dakota Phillips (Emily Mortimer) to kill anyone standingin the way of delivering the pharmacist to him; a cop on the take,Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); and McElroy's personal escort, FelixDeSouza (Robert Carlyle), hired to take him to wacky drug kingpinIki (Rhys Ifans). The action moves so rapidly throughout, with several zoom-in,zoom-out shots by cinematographer Poon Hang Sang, that""Formula 51"" even squeezes in a hot affair between the assassinand the escort.  Characters are sharply drawn: you won't likelymistake one for another.  Emily Mortimer shines as the conflictedone, taking the job of professional killer only to pay off hergambling debts to Lizard, but secretly holding the torch for theboyfriend whose heart she broke two years earlier.  Obligatorydouble-crosses are followed by revelations, as Sam Jacksonultimately bares all.  Edge fun all around.",Formula 51,R,2002,2
350,"Well, I now have a better appreciation for what the Supreme CourtJustices must feel when they have to write a dissenting opinion in a8-1 case.  Everyone I know from my friends to Siskel and Ebert havegone bananas over FORREST GUMP.  I saw it, and I was extremelydisappointed.  From BIG to PHILADELPHIA, I have seen and loved almostall of Tom Hanks's movies.  In a nutshell, I found this one to be along bore.  I checked my watch frequently and got sleepy by the end ofthe movie although we went to the 5:30 showing.       FORREST GUMP is about a boy with a marginal IQ.  He discovers thathe is very athletic however, and he finds to his amazement that this isimportant in life.  Forrest lives his life not for this, but for hisfriends and for the central character in his life, Jenny, his childhoodsweetheart (Robin Wright).  Sally Field plays an almost minor role ashis mother.  Gary Sinise plays a Vietnam vet.       The good parts of the movie are all technical.  Gump managespersonally to see numerous presidents and other historical figures.You will be amazed at how well the special effects work.       The best, and only good performance in the movie, is Hanks.  Hisperformance was amazing, but at times it was too mechanical - almost anautomaton.       Sinise, who was brilliant in OF MICE AND MEN, overacts as a clicheof a burned out Vietnam vet.  Field is okay.  Wright was miscast as thegirlfriend.  This was the second central figure in the movie, andWright was a weak actress who gave no life to the part.       My main fault was with the director (Robert Zemeckis) and thescreen writers (Winston Groom and Eric Roth).  Why did they have tomake it so long (2:22)?  Why did they feel they had to have Forrestswitch to a totally different amazing feat every 10 minutes?  Why notdevelop some aspects more?  It was almost like it was written by acommittee and everybody got to write 10 minutes of the story.       Most of all, why didn't the director have people that were realand that you cared about more?  All were way too mechanical for mytaste.  I should point out that almost everyone disagrees with mealthough Janet Maslin of the N.  Y.  Times was not impress by the showso at least I am not totally alone.  There was lots of crying in thetheater hence one of the reasons it is making zillions at the boxoffice.       FORREST GUMP is rated PG-13 for violence, a little nudity,discussions of sexual incest, battle carnage, etc.  I saw many manygrade school kids in the audience.  Frankly, I think that was amistake.  Teenagers, fine, but this not a kids (preteen) stuff movie nomatter how cute the previews may look.  I give the film * 1/2 fortechnical merit and do not recommend it. ",Forrest Gump,PG-13,1994,1.5
351,"In the mid-1980s, following the splendid debut in HughHudson's GREYSTOKE and relative success of first HIGHLANDERfilm, it looked like Christopher Lambert's acting careermight go somewhere. But, it wasn't meant to be, which becameobvious following HIGHLANDER II. In this decade ChristopherLambert became associated with films with low budgets andeven lower quality. Very often such films were sciencefiction, which meant that the fans of that genre learned thehard way what to evade anything starring ChristopherLambert. Whether it was because of real lack of talent,terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - theend result was almost always horrible. The same can be saidfor FORTRESS, 1993 science fiction film directed by StuartGordon, director who created cult following with his 1980shorror gorefests like REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND.  The movie is set in 2018. For some undisclosed reason, USAintroduced strict population control and couples are barredfrom having more than one child. Jake (Christopher Lambert)and Karen Brennick (Lori Laughlin) broke that law and arecaught by authorities on the border. Sentenced to 31 yearsin prison, they are both thrown into Fortress, privatelyowned correctional facility, equiped with state-of-the-artfuturistic technology and run by computer called Zed.Although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect ofinmates' lives and make any escape impossible, prisonauthorities often use violence. Jake survives many ordealsand earns respect of some inmates which would help him whenhe begins planing the escape. Such escape should becomenecessity, because the warden Poe (Kurtwood Smith) beginsshowing unhealthy interest in Karen.  After rather intriguing beginning and some interestingspecial effects that depict the futuristic settings ofprison, this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity. Thereason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates intowhole series of prison movie clich_s and situations that arepainfully predictable. By the time Brennick begins hisescape from Fortress, those situations not only begin tolook predictable, but utterly implausible too. Of course,film never tried to explain why the country that lacksresources to support its present population happens to spendbucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology withsole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerousmembers of the society. The initially interesting plot isdone even more wrong by stereotyped characters, played bynot too interested or talented actors. Lori Laughlin,although physically attractive, shows the acting ability ofsequoia. Kurtwood Smith as prison warden is ratheruninspired, capable of solid, yet forgettable performance.Lambert's performance is also good, but even the biggertalent couldn't help this film, destined to end in oblivion. ",Fortress,R,1993,0.5
352,"Miramax Films and Paramount Pictures have been marketing ""The FourFeathers,"" director Shekhar Kapur's inauspicious follow-up to 1998'sOscar-nominated ""Elizabeth,"" as a sweeping historical war epic ""thattakes you across two continents."" What the ads dare not say is thatthe film itself plays like a chintzy, Cliffs Notes version of a wannabeepic and, save for the sumptuous overhead shots of the desert landscapealready seen in the trailer, the cinematography (by Robert Richardson)is flat and thoroughly forgettable work.  The cut-rate look of the picture is far from the only thing ""The FourFeathers"" is lacking. The young, acclaimed ensemble, while deliveringadequately workmanlike turns, seem to have been cast based on theirbox-office draw rather than their being the best choices for the roles.Heath Ledger (2001's ""A Knight's Tale"") and Wes Bentley (1999's ""AmericanBeauty"") are especially bland. The story, based on a novel by A.E.W.Mason, despite being worthy enough to have been adapted to film multipletimes before, lacks even rudimentary passion or urgency under thehelm of director Kapur. I was not as big of a fan of Kapur's ""Elizabeth""as some were, but this still marks a major step down for him.  Set in 1884 during the British Empire uprising, Harry Faversham (HeathLedger) and Jack Durrance (Wes Bentley) are best friends and fellowlieutenants of the British army. Harry is engaged to Ethne Eustace(Kate Hudson), a passionate woman whom Jack also silently longs forfrom afar. When word comes that Harry and Jack's regiment will besent to Sudan to protect the Empire's interest, Harry abruptly resignshis commission. Harry, who only joined the army to please his demandingfather, is not prepared to sacrifice his life and his love with Ethnefor something he didn't want to do in the first place. The resultof his resignation, however, is the arrival of three white feathersfrom his comrades, each signifying cowardice. When Ethne sends hima fourth feather and his father refuses to speak to him any longer,a shunned Harry leaves for Sudan by himself, posing as an Arab ina last-ditch attempt to look out for Jack and reclaim his lost dignity. At 125 long minutes, ""The Four Feathers"" moves at an interminablysluggish pace. Had there been any characters to grow attached to,this might not have been the case. As is, the only question the filmleaves you with is why you should care about anything that is takingplace on the screen. The middle 80 minutes, set in the Sudan desert,are deadeningly dull beyond belief, and the major battle sequence--meantto be the picture's leading action showcase--is poorly edited togetherand elicits nothing more than a yawn. The bookending sequences set back home in Britain are its best, mostlydue to the welcome appearance of Kate Hudson (2000's ""Almost Famous""),the sole bright spot in an otherwise dreary slog of a movie. Hudson'sEthne is the only central figure who has a believable character arc,as she immediately regrets her decision to send Harry a white featherand recognizes how shallow the gesture really was. Meanwhile, Harry'sdecision to go to Sudan after he firmly states his reasons for notgoing with his regiment goes against everything his character hasbelieved in up to that point, making the story development a purelynonsensical one and the main protagonist a hypocrite. ""The Four Feathers"" represents a cut-and-paste example of how notto make a historical drama. With little palpable emotion except ofthe hackneyed variety, an abandonment of human or story depth, novisual flair, and even less visceral charge than what was seen inthis week's awful ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"" this latest ""The FourFeathers"" is far from a high watermark in the annals of the classicnovel. In fact, it comes exceptionally close to simply drowning.","Four Feathers, The",PG-13,2002,2
353,"      FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is about a man (Hugh Grant fromSirens) and a woman (Andie MacDowell from Sex, Lies, and Videotape) whokeep running into each other at weddings (4) and funerals (1).  Adelightful plot.  Grant is in instant love with MacDowell.  She likeshim, but he is merely her ""32nd lover"".   The scene where she tells himhis number is priceless as is all of the witty script by RichardCurtis.       Grant on the other hand is scorned as ""a serial monogamist"" whohas, with MacDowell, fallen in serious love for the first time.  He hasnot had as many (8) lovers as MacDowell, and he has been unable tocommit to any of them.  There is a great scene where they seat him at atable with many of his  ex-girlfriends - a real dinner party from Hellas they recount old stories.  The direction by Mike Newell in this andmost other scenes is right on the mark.       The characters are all written as fairly shallow people, and theirlines have no subtle hidden meanings.  The writer was content with justmaking a very funny and light hearted comedy.  It really works.  Manylines are hilarious.  He has filled the script with more interestingcharacters that you can count.  The third string characters in hisscript are quite funny.       The major scene stealer is the brother (a newcomer named DavidBower).  He cannot speak, but there is more funny sign language than Ihave ever seen in a movie.  Bower is handsome and wise.  His scene atthe last wedding is the high point of the show.  The funniest scenehowever goes to Grant's speech as the Best Man at the first wedding.       Although this is not the sort of movie that you will think aboutnext year or even next month, you will have a very good time at it.FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL lasts 1:57, but it seems much shorter dueto careful editing (Jon Gregory).  It is rated R, but it is a lightweight R.  Teenagers should love this show as well as adults.  Take adate; it's great fun.  It made *** in my book and is certainly a thumbsup. ",Four Weddings and a Funeral,R,1994,3
354,"Walt Disney Pictures, a studio infamous for relying on adaptationsand remakes over original thought, does it again with ""Freaky Friday,""a present-day redux of 1976's body-switching Barbara Harris-JodieFoster comedy. However, under the helm of director Mark S. Waters(2001's ""Head Over Heels"") and screenwriters Heather Hach and LeslieDixon (2000's ""Pay It Forward""), this is one of Disney's brightestand most winning live-action efforts in some time, a definite stepup from 1998's long-winded and inferior remake of ""The Parent Trap.""The movie is not only the most consistently funny of the year, butit is wise, in its own way, and actually has something truthful tosay about parental and sibling relationships. Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and 15-year-old Anna Coleman (Lindsay Lohan)are a bickering mother and daughter who can't seem to see eye-to-eyeon anything. While Tess is receiving no support for her impendingmarriage to the patient Ryan (Mark Harmon), Anna is frustrated thather mother doesn't understand her school life or support her aspirationsas a musician. With the help of a nosey Asian waitress (Lucille Soong)and two magical fortune cookies from the night before, Tess and Annaare horrified to wake up on Friday morning stuck in each other's bodies.Suspecting the phenomenon may have something to do with the Chineserestaurant they ate at, but with no idea how to reverse the spell,Tess and Anna have no choice but to go through the day living theother person's life. It doesn't help that it is also the day of Tess'wedding rehearsal and Anna's band competition at the House of Blues. While the basic plot outline of ""Freaky Friday"" is easily predicted,with Anna and Tess discovering how difficult the other person's lifeis and learning to understand each other, the ways in which it ishandled is intelligent and sometimes even surprising. Anna's Englishteacher (Stephen Tobolowsky), for example, is constantly giving herF's for no reason, something Tess blames on her daughter until shemust sit in on the class herself (in Anna's body) and finds that theteacher is giving her low scores for no good reason. Meanwhile, Anna(in Tess' body) discovers--much to her surprise--that her bratty littlebrother, Harry (Ryan Malgarini), is always in her hair because heactually looks up to her. ""Freaky Friday"" may be just a family comedy,but director Mark S. Waters has the courage and talent to turn thingsserious, even while avoiding corny, melodramatic sentimentality. Lest it seem like the movie doesn't know how to have any fun, thereare more genuine laughs in any fifteen-minute section of ""Freaky Friday""than in the whole of ""Johnny English."" When Anna must sit in on aninterview about Tess' new book on psychology, despite having no ideawhat it is about, the sticky situation escalates into sheer hilarity.Meanwhile, Anna's crush, a motorcycle-driving classmate named Jake(Chad Murray), is surprised to see his hobbies and tastes connectingmore closely with Tess (who is really Anna on the inside). The implicationsof a possible teen-adult romance within a Disney picture might havegotten pretty uncomfortable in the wrong hands, but it remains innocent,soft-spoken, and charming. In literally one of the best roles she has ever played, Jamie LeeCurtis (2002's ""Halloween: Resurrection"") is sheer dynamite, provingwhat a criminally underrated and untapped resource she often is asan actor. Curtis is poignant as the put-upon Tess, and hilariouslydead-on in her portrayal of the teenage Anna. Obviously having a ballwith such a meaty part and a marvelous comic talent, to boot, Curtishas given one of the standout performances of the year. In the reverserole of moody Anna who is thrown into Tess' body, Lindsay Lohan (starof ""The Parent Trap"" remake) is nearly as strong, realistic in herscenes as Anna and scarily accurate at playing the adult Tess. Speakingof a recently untapped resource, it is great to see Mark Harmon (1998's""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") in such a high-profile role, evenif his part as Tess' fianc‰ leaves him mostly unchallenged. Aside from the unnecessary feelings that go along with remakes, ingeneral, it is hard to complain about much of anything in ""FreakyFriday."" The film is fast-paced, its comedy never once drags, andits drama is more subtle and believable than one usually expects froma PG-rated family flick. At its core is the relationship between Tessand Anna, brought beautifully to life by Jamie Lee Curtis and LindsayLohan. When, at the end, they look at each other and smile, it reallyfeels like a mother and daughter have bonded--not only by blood, butby a keen understanding of who the other person is, inside and out.""Freaky Friday"" is warm-hearted without being treacly, and a comicdelight without delving into cloying theatrics. It also happens tobe one of the summer's most refreshing cinematic delights.",Freaky Friday,PG,2003,3.5
355,"FREDDY GOT FINGERED, written and directed by its star, Tom Green, has theworst trailers that I've ever seen, and it has been called the worst movieever made by some critics.  ""How bad could it be?"" I asked myself.  WhereasI'm not quite ready to call it the worst movie ever, it is certain to be atthe absolute top of my worst of the year list for this year.  A movie whosecruelty knows no bounds, it makes the mistake of confusing shock with humor.When you break a guy's leg so horrendously that the bone sticks out, itisn't funny.  And having Green lick the blood off the bone only makes itmore repulsive rather than making it somehow perversely funny. I'm one of the few critics who thinks that Tom Green's last major outing,ROAD TRIP, was one of last year's best and most underappreciated comedies.Perhaps Green has suffered some kind of blow to the head since then that haschanged his ability to ascertain what is humorous and what isn't.  Actinglike he is Andy Kaufman's evil twin, Green insults his audience from thevery beginning of FREDDIE GOT FINGERED. Stopping his car when he sees ahorny horse, he runs over to masturbate it. In the story, Green plays Gord Brody, an infantile 28-year-old skateboarderwho lives in his parents' basement since he is perpetually unemployed.Well, he does get a job at the Hollywood Cheese Sandwich Factory, but itdoesn't last.  Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty, drawing their agents' shortstraws, are stuck playing Gord's parents.  Torn copes by overacting whileHagerty tries her best to blend into the woodwork, hoping that no one willnotice her presence. With the manic behavior of someone about to overdose on cocaine, Gord seemsabout to explode in every scene.  While at a hospital, Gord delivers a babyfrom a woman whom he has irritated into an early labor.  After yanking herbaby out, he swings the baby rapidly around his head by holding on to theumbilical cord.  He then proceeds to bite through the cord, spewing bloodeverywhere.  The scene manages to be even more disgusting that thisdescription. There are a few briefly bearable -- bearable, not funny -- moments in thefilm, but it is impossible to catch your breath them since you areperpetually on your guard for the story's next atrocity.  As bad as thetrailers are, they are masterpieces of comedy next to the abomination of themovie itself.  Whatever you do, don't flirt with the idea that any moviethis bad might be fun to see.  This is a film that you don't want to inflicton yourself, no matter how adventuresome a moviegoer you think you are.Trust me.  A root canal without anesthetics would be less painful thatFREDDIE GOT FINGERED. FREDDY GOT FINGERED runs 1:33 but feels like three eternities.  It is ratedR for crude sexual and bizarre humor, and for strong language.  Consider itas NC-17.  This is not a movie for adults and certainly not for kids.",Freddy Got Fingered,R,2001,1
356,"      Director Lawrence Kasdan's latest movie is a romantic comedycalled FRENCH KISS.  The trademark of Kasdan's films (GRAND CANYON, BIGCHILL, and BODY HEAT) are the people.  All of his actors have uniqueand compelling personalities.  Moreover, his projects (GRAND CANYON,WYATT EARP, and SILVERADO) frequently have an epic feel to them.  Thiswas one of his non-epic movies, but it certainly was populated withsome fascinating and quirky characters.  I want to confess up frontthat GRAND CANYON was number one on my list in 1991 and BIG CHILL wasin 1983 so I am huge fan of Kasdan's body of work.       FRENCH KISS tells the story of Kate (Meg Ryan) an American who isin the process of renouncing her American citizenship so that she canbecome a Canadian and marry her fiance, a Canadian doctor played byTimothy Hutton.  She is deadly afraid of flying.  In an initial,hilarious sequence, she fails a fear of flying school and refuses totravel with the doctor to a conference in Paris.  While there, he meetsJuliet (Susan Anbeh), a French ""goddess"", and tells Kate he is leavingher for Juliet.  Kate goes to Paris and on the plane sits next to Luc,a French thief, played in a tour de force performance by Kevin Klein.Most of the movie has Luc trying to help Kate get the doctor back.There is also a significant subplot involving a stolen necklace and thechase by a the policeman (Jean Reno) to get it back.       The writing by Adam Brooks was quite funny.  The interchangesbetween Kate and Luc were precious.  He was crude and she was innocent,and the dialog was filled with them exchanging great one liners in anatural fashion of a real conversation rather than that of two greatcomics.  Brooks did add one scene which was a long sight gag with Katefalling on a dessert cart and crawling on her knees to avoid being seenby the doctor.  This piece of slapstick was pathetic and belonged, ifanywhere, in another movie.  I have no idea why the editor left it in.       Kasdan's directing was in the style of the BIG CHILL but with morecomedy and less pretense about the need to deliver a message.  Granted,there was a message in the movie, but it was subtle and tertiary to theplot and the subplot.  My respect for Kasdan's craft continues.       I frequently will think more of the writer or the director thanthe actors in a movie because writers and directors are the unsungheroes who are the determinates of whether a picture moves you or boresyou.  In FRENCH KISS, as good as the writing and the directing was, itwas ultimately the incredible performance by Kevin Kline that made themovie.  He owned every scene he was in.  Every time he opened his mouthyou were wondering how he was going to deliver his next line and whathis body language would be.       Kline is a versatile actor who has made the screen come alive inmany other films.  My two recent favorite roles of his were in DAVE andin PRINCESS CARABOO - both of which I recommend highly.  [I got aletter to the editor of Fortune Magazine about DAVE published so itwill always have a special place in my memory.] Kline as Luc was at thetop of his form.  There is no role of his, including his Academy Awardwinning role in A FISH CALLED WANDA, that I liked better.  This filmhas to be rated a must see for all of you Kevin Kline fans.       I would go to see any film with Meg Ryan in it.  She is cute,captivating, and intelligent yet always child-like and vulnerable.>From her best film (WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN) to her funniest (WHENHARRY MET SALLY) she has always dominated any picture she is in.  Sheis like the sun and the other actors circle her.  In FRENCH KISS, sheis terrific and yet, her performance pales in comparison to Kline's.This is his movie.       In the year 1980, Timothy Hutton was brilliant in ORDINARY PEOPLE.It has been straight down hill for him ever since.  He has been so badin many recent films, e.g., MADE IN HEAVEN, that they made my worst ofthe year list.  He stays consistent and never bothers to act or showany emotion in FRENCH KISS.  This is no easy feat since he is beingactively pursued by someone as cute as Ryan and as drop down deadgorgeous as Anbeh.  Most men might suffer a major meltdown just beingin the same rooms with these two.  Hutton manages to be oblivious toboth.  Major control I suppose or ice water in his veins.       The acting by the minor characters is good.  Reno plays the copwith a fresh approach.  I especially liked the acting by Anbeh, whotakes a minor part with almost no lines, and manages to make the juststand there and look beautiful role interesting.       I wish I knew the names of the costume designers and the makeupartists since I think they deserve special mention.  The costumes,especially the evolution of the costumes and the makeup for the twowomen leads was a key to the success of the film.  Watch how they makeKate go from innocent and cute (sexiest belly button I have seen in along time) to gorgeous and how they take Juliet in just the oppositedirection.  You can see it in the clothes, the make up, and in Juliet'slater, stark hairdos.  Finally, notice the evolution of the doctor'sclothes.  They get more and more outrageous until he becomes acaricature of an American playboy on the continent.       The cinematography was striking without ever being traveloguesque.The outside glow against the shadow of the bodies in the hotel wasbeautiful.  If you notice the fade to black of the most of the scenes,it fades fast at first but then lingers until only a dark shadowagainst a black background remains reminiscent of a memory locked intoour subconsciousness.       As someone who grew up in the 50s and 60s, I liked the doublemeaning of the title.  When I was a young boy, a French Kiss was aproscribed activity that you giggled about in the schoolyard and yetanxiously and fervently awaited your first chance at it. ",French Kiss,PG-13,1995,3

But, then, if it works, the past isinexorably changed, so what happens to the present? That'sall I'mgoing to tell you about the plot. Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" this is nota movie you want to know too much about.  Toby Emmerich has writtenastunning, multi-layered thriller that's part murder mystery,involvinga serial killer, part family drama, revolving around theloving relationship of father and son. Science-fiction time-travelfantasy goes back to Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and Emmerich'simaginative contribution is cutting-edge. Credibility is maintainedand continuity matches, despite thecomplicated plot twists andmind-bending paradoxes involving temporal intersections with paralleluniverses. Director Gregory Hoblit (""Primal Fear"") keeps the actionfast-paced and the tension taut, shooting the ham radio scenes like alive, multi-camera TV show. What's on the screen is totallyentertaining, emotionally gripping, and so thought-provoking that youmay want to see it twice.

Julie Taymor's bio is in many ways a conventional one, first-rate in every way except one: though we leave the movie housewith a strong image of the kind of person that Frida is, wescarcely know why she is famous since Taymor does not putenough of her works on the screen for us to evaluate. Though Frida Kahlo is less known that the painter who becameher husband at least until now the fault does not lie with anydearth of information, since over one hundred books have beenpublished specifically about her relationship with Diego Rivera Unlike Vincent Van Gogh who voluntarily disfigured himself at aself-destructive moment,  Friday (Salma Kayek), born in 1907,was the victim at the age of eighteen of a terrible accident.  Atrolley car in which she was riding crashed into a building, lodginga metal rod into her body and causing her a lifetime of pain andcomplications years later that would cause her allegedly tocommit suicide at the age of forty-seven.  Bedridden for months,bitter that her life of amusement with the young men of her timemight be over, she took up painting when her father (Roger Rees)presented her with an easel and discovered that she wasenormously talented.  She called upon Diego Rivera (AlbertMolina) for an honest opinion, one which pleased her and ledshortly to their marriage despite his refusal to promise her fidelity. Rivera would ultimately go to New York to paint a muralcommissioned by Nelson Rockefeller (Edward Norton) one whichwas torn down because the painter refused to change thepresence of Lenin on the canvas and later, back in Mexico, Riverawould provide shelter for political refugee Leon Trotsky (GeoffreyRush).   One gets the impression that the bi-sexual Frida wanted tocompete with her husband in the numbers of affairs sheconducted included one with Trotsky himself and a few with otherwomen.  Her tango with photographer Tina Modotti (Ashley Judd)generates more heat than the same dance between Lola Janscoand Regina Lambert in Jonathan Demme's ""The Truth AboutCharlie. Costume designer Julie Weiss shines in decking Ms. Hayek outwith exquisite, body clinging Indian outfits, but the surreal images,particularly one that simulates the title character's final illness andultimate cremation, are eye-poppers.  Rodrigo Preito showsMexican cathedrals and quaint neighborhoods favorably, theatmosphere given a huge boost by mariachi music on ElliotGoldenthal's soundtrack.",Frida,R,2002,3
359,"Whatever merits the mysteriously popular ""Friday"" series might holdis utterly lost upon me. 1995's ""Friday"" was nothing more than twocharacters sitting around for 90 minutes smoking weed, and 2000's""Next Friday"" was the worst film of that respective year, a comedythat somehow managed to not hold a single even mildly funny or wittymoment from beginning to end. ""Friday After Next"" (what's next? ""TheLast Friday of the Month?"") holds the distinction of not being quiteas bad as the insufferable ""Next Friday,"" but it is still a cinematicatrocity for which the term, ""lowest-common-denominator,"" was invented for. As with the previous outings, Ice Cube (2002's much smarter, muchfunnier ""Barbershop"") stars in and has written the screenplay of thislatest outing, with first-time director Marcus Raboy taking over thedirectorial reigns. There is no plot to speak of, only the slightesthint of a narrative to push the characters forward. Set completelyon Christmas Eve in South Central, L.A., Craig Jones (Ice Cube) andDay-Day (Mike Epps) are feuding, yet tight-knit brothers who are nowworking as security guards at a trashy strip mall with such storesas ""Pimps and Ho's Fashions"" and ""Toys N the Hood."" When they arethe latest victims of a string of burglaries being committed in thearea by a black man dressed in a Santa Claus suit, they make it theirgoal to catch him before the day is out. Aside from every character being presented as a shallow player orwhore, perhaps the most irritating thing about ""Friday After Next,""and the ""Friday"" series in general, is its complete laziness on thewriting level. There is nothing sharp, nothing smart, nothing observant,and certainly nothing funny about the jokes on display. Ice Cube canbe a fine actor, and he has been in many respectable films, but somehowhis brain goes on autopilot every time he pens a ""Friday"" screenplay.The jokes are all too obvious and slack and what passes for characterdevelopment is almost insulting in its stereotypical mindset.  Because of the money they continue to make, there must be an audiencethat enjoys the ""Friday"" series, but I wouldn't be interested in knowingany of them personally. The makers wrongfully portray the African-Americancommunity to be nothing more than immature dimwits whose only interestsare in getting high and getting laid, and in the case of ""Friday AfterNext,"" set back the advancements of the homosexual population by atleast fifty years. It may be all in good fun, but no fun comes out of it. At 85 minutes, ""Friday After Next"" is short but not sweet, and thereis but one strong laugh to be found (involving an ""Extra Medium"" tagthe Santa thief finds on a shirt he plans to steal). Mostly, though,the film is a lugubrious, patience-testing slog through vacuous materialand without even a semblance of creative inspiration. The whole enterprisewould easily warrant questioning involving what the point of its existenceis, but the unlucky viewers sulking their way out of the theater afterwardslikely won't be able to muster up enough energy to even do that.",Friday After Next,R,2002,1
360,"For those living under a rock, ""From Justin to Kelly"" is the big-screenspin-off of TV's ""American Idol,"" a musical love story starring firstseason's winner Kelly Clarkson and frizzy-haired runner-up JustinGuarini. Although their characters share the same names as them, theydo not play themselves and the story they are in is entirely fictional.Fictional not only because what happens isn't true, but because everythingthat happens could never occur within the real world. Clarkson andGuarini's goal of making a modern-day version of ""Grease"" is firmlydashed by the time the first embarrassingly amateurish and forgettablemusical number occurs. ""Grease"" may have been nothing more than lightweightcheese, but at least it was watchable and knew how to carry a tune. Kelly (Kelly Clarkson) is a struggling singer in an underpopulatedTexas bar. Justin (Justin Guarini) is, well, not much of anything.Along with her friends, the vixenish Alexa (Katherine Bailess) andstarry-eyed Kaya (Anika Noni Rose), and his best pals, the aspiringhunk Brandon (Greg Siff) and nebbish Eddie (Brian Dietzen), Kellyand Justin travel to Miami for the ultimate spring break and almostinstantly share a moment on the beach. It seems Kelly and Justin aremeant to be together, and would be if not for the catty Alexa, whowants Justin all to herself. Directed without much aplomb or anything else by Robert Iscove (2000's""Boys and Girls""), ""From Justin to Kelly"" is about as terrible asmost audiences are probably expecting. Written by Kim Fuller, themastermind behind 1997's ""Spice World,"" the film is clearly nothingmore than a chintzy attempt to cash in on the success of ""AmericanIdol."" No attempt is made to develop characters, test the acting abilitiesof its would-be superstars, or even create a premise that makes muchsense. None of this would matter, of course, if the song and dancenumbers offered any sort of flighty entertainment value, which theydon't. The choreography is flat and lifeless; the pop songs are thoroughlydisposable, mass-produced trash; and the lip-synching and sound mixhave to be some of the worst ever for a big studio motion picture.Some of the musical numbers are so dull and asinine, in fact, thatthe film realizes it and cuts away from them almost before they getstarted. Others, such as a climactic beach-set cover of ""That's theWay (I Like It),"" never seem to end. Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson are the main human attractions,as the rest of the cast are no-names who will likely never be heardfrom again. Guarini is just plain creepy to look at, while Clarksonshows some star quality that may one day be put to use in a bettermovie (but don't count on it). Save for a sweet duet near the end,called ""Anytime,"" singers Guarini and Clarkson ironically seem morecomfortable when they are just speaking dialogue rather than whenthey are called upon to lip-synch yet another piece of pop drivel.Together, they fail to ignite even the faintest tinge of romantic chemistry. 2001's ""Moulin Rouge"" and 2002's ""Chicago"" may have helped to repopularizethe movie musical with modern audiences, but ""From Justin to Kelly""is so wretched it may pull the rising genre into an early retirement.The plot's conflict is stupid and condescending, the type that couldbe solved in five minutes if the characters were written with anysort of sense. They aren't, and so unlucky viewers are forced to endurealmost 90 minutes of inane, turgid hogwash. Even the title makes zerosense. ""From Justin to Kelly?"" ""From Big-Screen Bust to the FieryDepths of Hell"" would have been more fitting.",From Justin To Kelly,PG,2003,1
361,"Memo to Steven Soderbergh: Boring is boring, and ugly is ugly.  FULL FRONTAL, the self-indulgent new picture by Oscar winning directorSteven Soderbergh (TRAFFIC), features actors awkwardly deliveringincredibly boring lines in a failed attempt at realism.  It is oneof the worst movies of the year. The story uses the old movie within a movie setup.  Much of the movieis shot with an overexposed, extremely grainy, unfocused, shaky andindecipherable look that will remind you of some of your embarrassingvacation videos that you plan on taping over as soon as you can. Although the ugly cinematography was clearly designed to give themovie a heightened sense of realism, what it gives you instead isa headache, since its low quality images cause you to squint so often. If Soderbergh wanted to make a vanity piece with all of his friendsin it, he didn't have to release it to theaters, where, I suspect,it will incur the wrath of many viewers.  The large number who walkout will be just as enraged as those who waste their time by staying. The confusing story features a large number of characters, none ofwhom we really get to know.  The saving grace is that the movie offersus no reason to care about any of these remarkably shallow people. The large and accomplished cast, including Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood,David Hyde Pierce, Catherine Keener, Mary McCormack and David Duchovny,is completely wasted.   ""I just want this day to be over!"" Lee (Catherine Keener) complainsto her to husband Carl (David Hyde Pierce).  I felt the same way aboutthe film itself.  I couldn't wait for the picture to end.  Watching it was painful.    FULL FRONTAL runs 1:47.  It is rated R for ""language and some sexualcontent"" and would be acceptable for teenagers. I would include my son, Jeffrey's, comments here, except that he andmy wife wisely walked out.  ",Full Frontal,R,2002,1.5
362,"      ""Folks don't laugh [at you] when you have a grand in your backpocket,"" reckons Gaz, a working-class bloke living on the dole inYorkshire.  He has a scheme, and what a scheme, that should raiseseveral thousand for himself and his unemployed buddies.       British audiences may know the term ""full monty,"" but Americansprobably will not.  The closest American slang might be ""buck naked,""and where either term comes from remains a mystery.  The film's title,THE FULL MONTY, refers to Gaz's crazy idea.  After a group ofChippendales comes to their mining town and cleans up, Gaz decides thathe and his friends could summon the courage for one night and outdo theChippendales.  His group will take it all off and not stop atG-strings.  There is, however, a slight problem of talent and looks.The local men being anything but buff.       The result is a typically zany British comedy dripping with pathosfor the workers.  One can reasonably view the film as a social satire,but that would be taking director Peter Cattaneo's comedy way tooseriously.  Still, one of the show failings is that sometimes it cannotfigure out what it wants to be and lets it morose aspects dominate atinappropriate moments.  First-time screenwriter Simon Beaufoy's scripthas rough edges that need working out, but the overall feel is of awriter with much promise.       The film opens with arguably the funniest scene in the picture.We are treated to a hokey but real documentary short promotingSheffield, ""a city on the move.""  Taken 25 years ago, it shows aprosperous Sheffield with booming industry and a good environment forraising a family.  The music is so relentlessly upbeat that I thoughtwe were going to see a pseudo-documentary a la the much more hilariousWAITING FOR GUFFMAN.       As soon as the opening credits end, we skip to the present whereGaz, his son, and one of his friends are trying to steal an iron girderfrom a derelict warehouse.  We soon learn that Gaz and all of hisfriends spend their days at the unemployment office where they wileaway their time smoking under the ""no smoking"" sign and doing all theycan to avoid even looking for a job.  Only Gaz's ex-foreman Gerald (TomWilkinson), who has not even told his wife he was laid off 6 monthsago, is actually trying hard to find a position.  And when he gets hisonly interview, his ""friends"" screw it up.  Tragic scenes like thiswork but only to the detriment of the film's comedic effect, and theywould have been better placed in a more serious film.       Gaz is played with resoluteness by Robert Carlyle from PRIEST andTRAINSPOTTING.  Although it is an ensemble cast, Carlyle's role is socentral that without his strong but vulnerable portrayal, the picturecould easily have sunk.       Once Gaz concocts his idea for a momentary ticket out of poverty,he needs two things, a guide and a cast.  He steals a copy ofFLASHDANCE for their instructional video, and they conduct auditionsfor cast members.  These auditions are among the show's funniestsequences.  Some guys are overweight and others are painfully skinny.One guy shows up who can't sing or dance, but who does have anincredible large male organ -- which is stared at in disbelief but notshown.  He is hired on the spot along with a fiftyish black guy, whocan actually dance, albeit only routines from the 60s.       In another beautiful scene, the guys have just about given up andare back in the unemployment line to collect their checks when one oftheir dance numbers comes on the loudspeakers overhead.  Slowly theystart dancing to the rhythm until each of them realizes they mustfollow through on their big plan.       Until the very end, it is still not clear if some, all, or none ofthem will actually bare it all.  You may even find the ending a bit ofa surprise.  With a subtext of desperation and anti-Thatcherism, thefilm tries too hard to deliver a message, but it remains quite funnynevertheless.       THE FULL MONTY runs a breezy 1:30.  It is in English so thick withYorkshire accents and slang that American audiences are doomed to missparts of it but not enough to detract from the film's comedic punch.The movie is rated R for one scene of male nudity and for someprofanity, and it would be fine for teenagers.  I recommend thissometimes too bittersweet comedy to you and give it ***. ","Full Monty, The",R,1997,3
363,"Do you long for the good old days when New York newspapersand post cards were a penny, seltzer was two cents, when youcould smoke in restaurants and be free from the harassments ofpolice who ticket you for a blown-out back light on your twelve-year-old VW?  Would you want to live in Manhattan when monthlyrents were in two figures, being at the crossroads of the nation'sculture without maxing out on your MasterCard?  Then set yourtime machine back to when different ethnic groups lived togetherharmoniously, when you could walk the streets at night whilekeeping your head on your shoulders, and where you couldbreathe pure air and glorious sunshine free from the pollutants ofautomobiles, planes and cell phone indulgences.  Oops...youmade a mistake.  You went back to the 1860's only to findyourself in a city enmeshed in such violence and corruption thattoday's Manhattan looks remarkably like Plato's Republic.  ToTrent Lott's dismay, slavery is breathing its last gasp, butinsidious forces of class and culture are ripping the core from theBig Apple.     What would you find in those glorious days of yesteryear? According to Martin Scorsese, a devotee of films of intelligence,visual beauty, verbal style and feverish imagination, you'd witnessthings that teacher never told you about our Great Nation, but thenagain the revisionists who diss Abraham Lincoln for not reallycaring whether slavery existed or not and downgrade Columbus fornot really discovering America and for bringing nothing but diseaseand death to the natives, would not be at all surprised.     If you lived in the middle of the 19th century in the area nowinhabited by Manhattan's Federal Courthouse just blocksnortheast of City Hall, you'd in the center of a storm.  This was theneighborhood that would make Hell's Kitchen, the scene for ""WestSide Story,"" look like Dorothy's Kansas.  At the crossroads of fivelarge avenues centered on Paradise Road was the a sectioncalled Five Points where sordid things were going down.Boss Tweed ruled Tammany Hall, responsible for getting votes forhis party especially from the immigrants who lurched forth fromboats, eager to avoid the famine and general poverty of Ireland. As Tweed (Jim Broadbent) states in the film, it's not the ballotsthe win elections: it's the counters.  Tweed was not at alldisturbed to have his henchmen drag workers away from whateveractivity they considered more important.  Women of the nightworked the 'hood, some moonlighting as pickpockets such as theprettiest redhead in the city, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz)who might have introduced current pliers of the trade with themethod often used, bump and pick.  (When Jenny wouldaccidentally trip over you, you mind was not on your wallet for themoment.)     Cops were corrupt, of course, the neighborhood covered byHappy Jack (John C. Reilly).  The film's center, however, is theconflicted relationship between Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewisperforming in the role of the meat-cutter who actually existed atthe time), and a second-generation Irish-American who had beenin the country all his life, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio). Amsterdam at the age of about six witnesses a small warin 1846 between the so-called Nativists who believe themselvesto be the True Americans and were led by Bill the Butcher, andthe newer settlers, the Irish, led by Amsterdam's dad, PriestVallon (Liam Neeson).  Weapons, shown to us in the audienceclose up, include axes, sticks, knives and bricks, and it is herethat the forces believing that too much violence in the moviesspills over into audience action would be tempted to leave thetheater as the cobblestone streets are painted blood-red.     When Scorsese moves forward by sixteen years to1863-3, the Civil War is in progress, men are being draftedalthough the rich fellows who had $300 could buy their way out,and Amsterdam strangely becomes a best buddy of Billpresumably because as an orphan Amsterdam looks to his dad'skiller as a powerful father figure while for his part the childless Bill""adopts"" the young man not knowing his real identity.  Thenucleus of the drama is the ironic relationship between the twocourageous men, Bill teaching Amsterdam how to kill by havinghim practice on a pig (whose organs are most similar to those ofhuman beings).  Ultimately Amsterdam's identity becomesknown, leading to a final face-off in July 1863 between the forcesthat Amsterdam has rallied to his side and the Nativists led byBill.  To add to the fireworks, to the obligatory finale, the UnionArmy has come to New York, rifles blazing, in its mandate to putdown the Draft Riots the worst in American history as hundredsof New Yorkers too poor to buy their way out smash and loot thehomes of the rich (like the Schermerhorns) and the draft boarditself.     While ""Gangs of New York"" brilliantly recreates the battlescenes both in 1846 and 1863 filmed by Michael Balhaus not inthe Big Apple but rather in Rome's Cinecitta massive studios the film is less successful in conveying the psychology of theparticipants.  At one point, a man shouts, ""The Irish are takingaway the jobs of the real Americans,"" but since that cry fadesquickly we wonder whether that argument, at least somewhatbased in rationality, was a principal cause of the ethnic cleansing.Still another offers that the new immigrants owe their allegiance tothe pope in Rome and not to the American idea.   More likely wecan assume that the central cause is hatred, pure and simple thefear of people who are different in culture.  Maybe there'ssomething hardwired into human beings that give rise to suchanimosity.  After all, do people not sometimes say when thefighting is done that they feel exhilarated?       As actors Daniel Day-Lewis overshadows Leonardo DiCaprio,who this year feels more at home in the great Spielberg comedy,""Catch Me If You Can.""  Day-Lewis, performing in the role of aman without moral restraints, is mesmerizing, making us questionwhether Mayor Michael Bloomberg could succeed in enforcing hisno-smoking rules against Bill the Butcher and his coterie ofslaughterers. ",Gangs of New York,R,2002,3

""Garden State""packs an awful lot of information into one zany weekend in astory which, broadly outlined, informs us that Andrew Largeman(Zach Braff) has been on the outs with his psychiatrist dad,Gideon Largeman (Ian Holm) during the entire time that Zach isaway. In a few precious days of fun, solemnity and most of alllove, he realizes that life back east just may be so good that allthe jokes that New Yorkers love to tell about New Jersey simplyhave no relevance. On second thought the Jersey gags do have some truth, giventhe ensemble of characters that call the garden state their home,people who are known by Zach and some whom he meets_butall contribute to the fellow's realization that life is a strange andwonderful abyss, so we may as well stay away from the rim andlearn from its sad moments and zany times as well. And what a cast of characters!  No sooner does he arrive forhis mother's funeral than he runs into a funky group of oddballs,particularly his best friend from way back, Mark (PeterSarsgaard), who has not become a brain surgeon or rocketscientist but a stoner employed in a dead-end job (so to speak):a grave digger, who happens to toss the dirt over Zach's mother. Others include Mark's hip and equally stoned mom, Carol (JeanSmart) who despite her predilection for the weed loves to nag herson to make something of himself.   Zach's somewhat late coming-of-age, call it a revitalization,involves his metamorphosis from a zonked-out, emotionallynumb young man strung out on lithium and an entire medicinecabinet of anti-depressant drugs prescribed by his well-meaningbut tragically wrong-headed psychiatrist father. His dad hasnever stopped blaming his boy for Zach's involvement in anaccident that caused the boy's mother to become paralyzed fromthe waist down. He emerges from the apathy brought out by themedication when he meets the quirky Samantha (NataliePortman), a pixie-ish woman in her early twenties who claimsright off that she often lies and who, despite her high energy andgood-sport nature is a girl who is troubled in her own way. Neuroses attract. While ""Garden State"" is above all a romantic comedy that isthankfully not in the vein of the insipid love stories that pass forreality in Hollywood, Braff populates his indie-budget story, shotin just 25 days during a break in his career with NBC's sitcom""Scrubs,"" with a flurry of vignettes that are sometimes off-the-wallfunny and, when not, are distinctly amusing. His visit to aneurologist, Dr. Cohen (Ron Leibman), is a gem in itself, withLeibman acting to type as a hail-fellow doc whose way of creatingrapport is to crack a joke, then move from his desk to sit besidehis patient_who had been complaining of headaches, and whocan blame him with all the junk he's swallowing per his father'sadvice? Shortly thereafter, Mark introduces him during a pouringrain to a man and woman and their baby_all of whom live in anbiblical-style ark overlooking a chasm of natural beauty, a kind ofGrand Canyon, over which develops have talked of destroying tomake way for a mall. Not a scene is wasted, from an opener showing this emotionallynumb Largeman as a waiter in an L.A. restaurant who seems tobe in his own world, insisting to a customer that hisestablishment does not have bread because ""it's Vietnamese."" This is an assured work filled with oddball humor, a slice of lifethat sometimes lags during the writer-director's scenes withNatalie Portman (who can become annoying with her too-obviousquirkiness) but which on the whole show what can be done with asmall budget and a limited number of days, making multipletakes of scenes out of the question.",Garden State,R,2004,3.5
365,"What if the world somehow found a way to make discrimination into ascience?  That is the provocative question presented by Gattaca, theintriguing and atmospheric debut of writer-director Andrew Niccol. Those looking for a more effects-laden science fiction film will bedisappointed by Gattaca, which centers more on drama than on priceypyrotechnics.  Set in ""the not-too distant future,"" the film is set in asociety where one's station in life is determined solely by genetics.Advances in genetic engineering have made natural breeding obsolete; toensure a promising future for their children, prospective parents turn togeneticists to create their babies in a lab, where they take the mostdesirable genetic traits of the parents--and weed out their mostundesirable--to create a ""perfect"" child.  This genetic elite, called""Valid,"" are given all the golden opportunities in life--jobs,wealth--while the ""In-valids,"" those created from natural breeding, make upthe poor lower class. One of these ""faith children,"" as they are called, is Vincent Freeman(Ethan Hawke), a precocious young man who dreams of flying to the stars.Even though his genetic makeup makes it impossible for him to realize hisdream, he does so anyway--by dealing with a black market DNA broker (TonyShalhoub), who arranges Vincent to swap places with Jerome Morrow (playedwith scene-stealing gusto by Jude Law), a valid whose genes are of no useafter being paralyzed from the waist down.  As Jerome, Vincent builds asuccessful career at the aeronautics corporation Gattaca and is all set tofly on a mission to Titan, one of Saturn's moons.  But after the directorof Gattaca is murdered, and an In-valid eyelash is found in the ensuinginvestigation, it seems like only a matter of time before ""Jerome"" is exposed. Much of this material harkens back to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, butI must give credit to Niccol, who paints a vivid, funny, yet disturbingportrait of this future society.  The best moments come from the littledetails in the script.  For example, when Vincent is born, the doctors canimmediately determine his lifespan and what illnesses he is likely tosuffer from; In-valids are sometimes referred to by the slur""de-gene-erate""; and some rather curious dating rituals: when Vincentexpresses interest in Valid but slightly imperfect colleague Irene (astrangely uninteresting Uma Thurman, in a thankless role), she offers him astrand of her hair for a DNA check and says, ""Let me know if you're stillinterested.""  Niccol's fascinating vision also extends to the strikingcinematography, production and costume design by Slawomir Idziak, JanRoelfs, and Colleen Atwood, respectively.  They obviously did not have asubstantially large budget to work with, but they succeed in creating anotherworldly look through minimalism.  Buildings are shiny and smooth;people dress up in nice suits; and color is all but absent--everythingseems constantly bathed in some shade of grey or silver, perfectlyconveying the sense of coldness and lack of passion that dominates thisglacial society. Niccol's attention to detail does not extend, however, to Gattaca's basicplot mechanics, which are rather contrived.  The murder mystery plot turnsout to be little more than a device to put Vincent in danger of beingdiscovered and does not reach a satisfying conclusion on its own.  Asupposed plot twist involving one of the murder's investigators (LorenDean) is predictable and uninspired, and a sibling rivalry subplot exploredearly in the film between Vincent and his genetically engineered youngerbrother is revisited later to very little effect; it just serves as anextraneous, redundant underscoring of the point that genetics are noteverything.  The one relationship that is supposed to lend some warmth tothe proceedings, the romance between Vincent and Irene, fails to ignite;Hawke and Thurman may have generated sparks off camera, but very little, ifany, of that rapport is displayed onscreen. When I first saw the trailer for Gattaca, I and a few other peoplesnickered at the terribly banal tagline ""There is no gene for the humanspirit.""  As cornball as it is, that simple statement quite effectivelysums up the true nature of the film.  For all of its big Hollywood sci-fitrappings, Gattaca is essentially an intimate human story, and anunexpectedly moving and inspiring one at that.  By the time it is over, onemay just find oneself with (somewhat) renewed faith in the human race. ",Gattaca,PG-13,1997,3
366," Let's start by clearing up one point.  First-time writer/director David Gordon Green's GEORGE WASHINGTON is not about the father of our country.  In fact, the movie isn't about much of anything, which you will find out if you can manage to stay awake.  With its minimal plot and acting, there aren't any characters worth caring much about even though the director tries hard to pull on our heart-strings with some contrived tragedies.  Although one can assume that the production had a written script, it feels like something from a junior college improvisational group.     Set in a graffiti-filled, rural South that looks like an inner city ghetto, the story wants badly to be the next STAND BY ME.  As the story's enigmatic lead, 12-year-old George, Donald Holden delivers an exceptionally bland performance.  George has a baby-like head, so he wears a football helmet since an accidental blow to the head might kill him.    The central and only substantial incident occurs in a bathroom where one of the kids slips and cracks his skull during some innocent horseplay.  Incongruously, the other kids just stare at him.  They don't appear upset, and they don't take him for medical help.  Eventually, they decide to move the dead body but do a terrible job of hiding it.  This is all so unbelievably written and acted that it is almost impossible to have much sympathy or concern for the kids, even the dead one.  Watching it is like observing some little children play acting on the street.  The movie's saving grace, to the extent that it has one, is Tim Orr's vibrant, rust-colored cinematography.  At its best, it evokes the lush sort of images found in THE THIN RED LINE.  Declining an offer to come to a girl's house, George tells her, ""I just ain't got nothing to say.""

It even has MONTY PYTHON regular JohnCleese supplying the voice of George's intellectual sidekick, the apenamed ""Ape.""       Brendan Fraser, who has been in a long string of silly movies(including ENCINO MAN) and a few serious ones (the best being SCHOOLTIES) hams it up as George.  Everyone in the show knows that they havesigned up to do a farce so they milk the slapstick as hard they can.Depending on your point of view, this film is either truly awful or sobad it is good.  In either case, be warned that a little of thisrepetitive movie can go a long way.       The show starts with Ursula Stanhope (played by Leslie Mann fromTHE CABLE GUY), a rich heiress from ""Frisco"", and her snooty fiance,Lyle Vandergroot (Thomas Haden Church), on a safari in darkest Africa.They are there to see apes, and while in camp, they hear of theexistence of a white ape.       Ursula, a ditzy blonde with the brainpower of a church mouse,seems well matched to her intended.  Lyle, with his ascot and hisdesire for a latte in the jungle, has an intelligence equal to hisfiancee's.  He is also a major coward and a liar.  Both Mann and Churchplay their characters as pure camp.       The best actor in the show is never seen.  Keith Scott, with avoice like Robin Leach from ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"" is thefilm's all-knowing narrator.  When Lyle, on a lark, causes one of hisguides to fall several thousand feet into the river canyon, thenarrator reassures the kiddies in the audience.  ""Don't worry,"" hetells them.  ""Nobody dies in this story.  They just get really bigboo-boos.""  And when George gets shot point blank in the head, thenarrator reasons with us, ""George can't die because he's the star.""       After the narrator, the next best parts of the film are the fewspecial effects.  Most of us never seen a full grown elephant thatjumps around and has all the mannerisms of a dog.  George has just sucha hybrid, and the elephant is the largest and most unusual version ofman's best friend you are ever likely to see.  Imagine an elephantplaying fetch.       Of course, George's raison d'etre is his proclivity to crash intoeverything, especially trees.  (""Watch out for that tree!"" is theshow's mantra.)  Fraser has the muscular body and the ridiculous smilethat makes him well chosen for the part.  George's costume consistssolely of what he refers to as a ""mud flap,"" and his home is a SwissFamily Robinson-style tree house, complete with an elevator.       After way too many flatulence jokes, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE finallyruns out of gas and ends.  But don't leave yet.  There's a funnyepilogue set in Las Vegas.       And then it does end, well sort of.  The film's theme song isguaranteed to remain firmly planted in your brain for months.  You'llbe singing it at the office, driving your coworkers crazy.  (""George,George, George of the jungle, watch out for that treeeeee!"" Aargh, I'mdoing it again.)       GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE runs 1:32, which is longer than it sounds.The movie is rated PG, but consider it a G and fine for kids of anyage.  My son Jeffrey, age 8, thought it was ""great!""  His favorite partwas when George's doggish elephant loaded his trunk up like a cannonand shot a bad guy in the rear with a toucan.  I give the picture amild thumbs up and ** 1/2. ",George of the Jungle,PG,1997,1
368,"If you're a guy, have you ever been so desperately lost that you broke downand in an unmanly show of cowardice asked a woman for directions?  If so, you'llunderstand how Gerry felt when leaving the car, taking a hike on a wildernesstrail that led to a desert with sands as far as the eye can see, and thoughtthey were going to die.  The ""they"" is not a typo.  The two people are unnamedin what is essentially a two-character experimental piece by Gus Van Sant:hardly a picture to die for.  They call each other Gerry because they're goodfriends and ""Gerry"" is a code word meaning something else, something related tothe idea of ""screw-up.""  So if one dude calls the other Gerry and is calledGerry in return, what they both mean is ""Hey, screw-up...""  In fact what MattDamon and Casey Affleck, friends in real life as well as in this picture, arebringing out is that people who know each other for a long time, who hang outregularly with one another, may talk in such a code that outsiders would have tohire the folks who broke the Enigma to understand what they are saying.     Not that they have anything of importance to say in this film.  The dialogueis spare and shorn of wit (written by the two actors as though a vanity piece,and it shows), the landscape is flat for the most part, the piano keys ofcomposer Arvo Part no competition for those of Chopin of Mozart.  Even Thoreauhad grass around his Walden cabin and a nice pond to wade into and even use fordrinking.  These two are stripped.  They take a walk without a compass, withouta cell phone, without water, and Van Sant wants to show us not only what lifecould be like without the material goodies that we Americans are addicted to butmore important, what a film is like when it's stripped to the bone.  This""Gerry"" is as anti-Hollywood as a movie can get: no car chases, no wiseassdialogue, no explosions, little exposition, unmotivated action, little editing. This is Gus Van Sant's rebellion against MTV that recalls Andy Warhol's ""Sleep""and ""Empire"" (a camera focusing on a man sleeping and on New York's tallestbuilding respectively). There's a touch of ""The Blair Witch Project"" as well,except that what awaits the two is not some Golem or Gollum that appearssuddenly in a cave but the horror of sheer nothingness.     What's the story?  Two friends who call each other Gerry (Matt Damon andCasey Affleck) leave their cars somewhere in Utah or New Mexico or California'sDeath Valleywho knows?  the production notes do not reveal this informationandstart walking in the woods.  When Damon, the alpha male, suggests that theyavoid ""tourists"" (two other people who are walking in the same direction) bytaking an undiscovered path, they lose their bearings, and as the hours and daysroll on they speak to each other even less than they did in the opening scenefeaturing the friends in a car driving and driving, and driving and drivingwithin speed limits though there's nothing around them for 50 miles.  As theyget hungry and thirsty and, at night, cold, they begin to see mirages.  In theone comic scene, Affleck finds himself on top of a rock some forty feet from theground (how he got there nobody knows) while Damon paces around like a doglooking for a good spot to dig a crevice in the sand with his shoes so that hisfriend can jump.  There are some images that could be used by the tourist boardof Utah or New Mexico or California or wherever this mysterious place is, butaside from that, the film's interest is strictly in the concept that this sortof thing hasn't been done for ages.      So we get a rebellion against the current slam-bang Hollywood style offilmmaking.  Is that a good thing?  Sure, it's a big plus when a filmmakereschews Vin-Diesel-like formulaic action, but going to the other extreme is notthe answer.  What ""Gerry"" does for us in the audience as we watch these twofellas trudge for days without even the material comforts that the Taliban wouldallow is give us the impression we are sprouting calluses on our feet.  Oh,ditto on our behindsfrom shifting about in our seats. ",Gerry,R,2003,1.5
369," Generic brands have revolutionized consumer products from drugs to cigarettes, so why not movies?  Maybe the multiplexes of the future will dispense with marquee titles in favor of generic packaging labels like Comedy, Romance and Action.   If so, GET CARTER would appear to be a trend setter, as you couldn't find a more generic action thriller than GET CARTER.  Its dialog is superfluous.  What little impact the movie has is due solely to its clich_d images.  The problem with this line of reasoning is that movies like GET CARTER, starring pricey stars like Sylvester Stallone, can't be made on a pittance, so the tickets have to be full price if there is ever to be any hope of recouping the financial backers' investments.  And, if moviegoers are required to pay about nine bucks a ticket for a bad movie like GET CARTER, why wouldn't they choose instead a great one, like ALMOST FAMOUS, for the same price?  GET CARTER, as you may know, is a remake of perhaps the best known film of director Mike Hodges (CROUPIER).  The original in 1971 starred Michael Caine as Jack Carter.  Caine, replaced by Sylvester Stallone, gets a cameo part in this version, which is directed by Stephen T. Kay (the writer of THE MOD SQUAD remake) and written by David McKenna (BODY SHOTS).  The recent r_sum_s alone of the director and writer should give you pause.  As the story opens, Carter is attending the funeral of his estranged brother, who died under mysterious circumstances.  As a fossilized action hero, Stallone just stares and broods when he's not hitting someone.    Mickey Rourke, an actor whose mere presence in a movie immediately raises a big red flag in my mind, plays Carter's nemesis, Cyrus Paice.  Cyrus, with his ubiquitous dark sunglasses framed in iridescent green, shares a trait with Carter.  With their aging muscles and bulging veins, they look like a couple of old lifeguards who are about to OD from too many late nights at the gym.  The women are all given throw away parts, Miranda Richardson as Carter's sister-in-law, Rachael Leigh Cook as his niece and Gretchen Mol as Carter's love interest.  The important roles go to the boys with their toys, who get to chase in fast cars, shoot noisy guns and fight with big fists.    The movie is set, incongruously, in that hotbed of crime, that notorious underworld city of latte lovers and dot-com darlings -- Seattle!  As a wiry and flagrantly wealthy software geek, Alan Cumming modestly informs Carter that ""I'm the all powerful ruler of time and space.""  See what excessive caffeine will do to your brain.  Before annihilating the first guy to get in his way, Carter tells him, ""You really don't want to know me.""  I completely agree.  You don't want to waste your time and money getting to know Jack Carter, especially when the movie in the next screen would have to be better.  GET CARTER runs a long 1:55.  It is rated R for violence, language, some sexuality and drug content and would be acceptable for older teenagers. ",Get Carter,R,2000,1.5
370,"GET OVER IT, by director Tommy O'Haver (BILLY HOLLYWOOD'S SCREEN KISS) andwriter R. Lee Fleming, Jr. (SHE'S ALL THAT), suffers from a bad case of thetwo-movies-in-one syndrome.  One movie is a promising, albeit unoriginal,teen romance in which Berke (Ben Foster) loves Allison (Melissa Sagemiller),who has broken up with him in order to date a more popular kid, Striker(Shane West), a former member of a boy band.  All the while, Berke staysgood friends with Kelly (Kirsten Dunst, BRING IT ON), who would be a muchbetter choice for him if he would just realize it. The second movie is a traditional crude teen comedy complete with a horsewho urinates profusely on a guy's face and a dog who has sex with everyinanimate object he passes.  A bad Martin Short -- Is there any otherlately? -- chews up the scenery as an obnoxious high school play directorwho looks like Bobby Darren dressed as the devil.  He says things like, ""Methinks thou better not botch it,"" to his cast.  This second movie feelsalmost like an afterthought in order to obtain studio funding.  The firstmovie doesn't deserve this crude level of humor. Containing several imaginative dream sequences and a cute ending with amusical adaptation of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" GET OVER ITcould have been a sweet little movie.  Instead, we end up feeling sorry forthe two likable leads, Foster and Dunst, who have to endure all of thestory's failed attempts at making recycled bathroom humor funny. GET OVER IT runs 1:25.  It is rated PG-13 for some crude/sexual humor, teendrinking and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.  ",Get Over It,PG-13,2001,2
371,"      Always imaginative director Spike Lee turns his attention to areal event in his fictionalized account of last year's October 16thMillion Man March.  His vision of the events is called GET ON THE BUS,and it takes the perspectives of one busload of black men from SouthCentral Los Angeles headed to Washington for the big march.       The show is a rich tapestry of subjects and contrasting opinions.Just about every type of African American male gets on the bus.  Wehave well off ones (Andre Braugher as up and coming actor Flip) andpoor ones (Ossie Davis as downsized employee Jeremiah), cops (RogerGuenveur Smith as ghetto cop Gary) and reformed killers (GabrielCasseus as ex-gang-banger Jamal), homosexuals (Isaiah Washington andHarry J. Lennix as lovers Kyle and Randall) and heterosexuals (therest), promiscuous ones (notably Flip) and abstainers (Jamal),Christians and Muslims, religious believers and atheists, and mostsurprising of all, they even let a black Republican car dealer (WendellPierce as Wendell) on the bus.  This faux piece of inclusionarypolitics is soon eradicated by having the Republican painted as such anenormous bigot that they declare him to be an ""Uncle Tom"" and quicklyand physically throw him off of the bus.       Also on the bus is a father, Evan Thomas Sr. (Thomas JeffersonByrd), and his teenage son Junior (DeAundre Bonds), who have beenshackled together by a court order.  The driver of the bus, George, isplayed in a rock of Gibraltar roll by Charles Dutton.  George tries tomake Evan Sr. feel better by telling him, ""Teenagers mess up.  You knowman, that's what they do best.""       Hill Harper is UCLA film student X, short for Xavier.  There is atoken white - a Jewish person named Rick (Richard Belzer) who is thealternate bus driver for a while until all of the discussions, pro andcon, about Louis Farrakhan become too much for him.  His parting wordsto George are, ""I wouldn't expect you to drive to a Ku Klux Klanrally.""       Perhaps the best part of the film is the lack of conclusions.Other than the one sided view of Republicans, other issues areintroduced and pondered, but the film does not attempt to lead theviewer to any particular point of view.  The script by Reggie RockBythewood seems happy just to be able to bring all of the subjects up.       When the show starts, Gary's girlfriend Shelly (Kristin Wilson) isdropping him off in her fancy convertible.  She complains about themale only march that, ""this thing is exclusionary.""  He listenspolitely, but gets on the bus anyway.  He is half white, and the colorof his skin makes him an easy and frequent target on the bus for themore prejudiced.       ""Father God, we come to you on a pilgrimage that is bound forglory,"" intones Jeremiah on the bus before they embark.  Soon they areoff to the loud and rhythmic music of James Brown.  As in most SpikeLee movies, there is a lot of music and singing.  It reminded me of thebus on the way to the football games in high school where all of theplayers sang.  Their Washington journey starts off full of high energyand fun.       Along the way they spend their time on the bus gabbing about theirlives back home and arguing issues.  There is even the obligatoryfistfight, which I could have done without.       Sometimes they do take a break as they do at a rest stop whereever on the make Flip tries his moves on a couple of female strangers.His come on line is, ""I've always heard that Dallas has the finesthoneys on the planet.""  He sees this as natural male behavior whethersingle or married and argues with his fellow men, ""You tell me what menwho like women wouldn't want a little something on the side?""       This is film with so many people in it, it is easy to lose track.Even Randy Quaid drops by in one scene playing the cliched racistsouthern police officer.       Most of the show is a talkfest heading no place in particular.Only the bus has a direction.  In a meandering show, toward the finishit takes a dramatic and unexpected turn.  This is quite well done, butSpike Lee then throws on several extra endings which are onlyredundant.       There is one serious problem with the show.  The prints of ElliotDavis's cinematography have major color problems.  There are two longsequences, one lasting ten minutes where the color is so far off thatyou would refuse to pay for the processing if some lab did this to yourfilm.  It is my understanding that this is not some problem with justthe print that I saw, but that it is a general problem and an artifactof rushing the show to the theaters in time for the march'sanniversary. ",Get on the Bus,R,1996,2.5
372,"An epic, sweeping and fact-faithful vision of the turning point of America'sappalling 4-year Civil War.  Far from being a one-sided affair where theeconomically superior Federals crushed a rebellion by the impoverishedSouthern states, this film demonstrates exactly how close General RobertE Lee's forces came to victory, and altering the whole course of history.  This is a drawn out affair - originally shown on US television in episodes.The duration allows the stage to be realized atmospherically, and thevarious commanding officers introduced.  When battle does commence, tactics remain lodged at the Napoleonic stage:mass infantry charges across open ground.  Defensive firepower, however,has improved considerably: Gettysburg becomes the resting place for tensof thousands of young Americans. The leading players are well cast, and some even bear striking resemblancesto their historical models.  Lee was the dynamic and forthright Southerncommander.  Martin Shaw captures the essence of the leader: a painstakingbeliever in duty, but a man who personally feels the desperate infantrycasualties, and who understands that he went through military academywith many of his opposite numbers.Tom Berenger is gruffly solid as General Longstreet, the brilliantConfederate tactician who urges caution, even as Lee plans outright victory.On the Northern side, Jeff Daniels gives his schoolteacher-turned-officercalm dignity, coupled with a daring streak.   Actual events are presented in dramatized form.  While everyone knows theNorth prevailed on the day, the attention to detail and the characterizationgive the story its dramatic purpose and drive.  The main Confederate assaultsignaling the final day of hostilities is a stirring picture of the nobilityand, ultimately, pointlessness of war. In every aspect - scenery, uniforms, campsite layouts, equipment, drillingof thousands-strong ranks of men, right down to how individuals on eitherside view their situations - Gettysburg is a vivid portrayal of ahistory-forging battle. By dwelling on the hopes and despair of the officers who have close friendsand relations in the enemy ranks, the nightmare of a Civil War is rammedhome with depth and poignancy. While all the lead characters are based on actual officers, we get no insightinto the mindset of the actual foot soldiers facing musket balls acrossopen country.Saving Private Ryan has created a whole new blueprint for the visceralsavagery of war.  Somehow a direct artillery hit causing a few men tostumble to the ground becomes quaintly anachronistic.   The combination of strong characters and attention to period detail createsa visually stunning portrait of a defining moment in American history.",Gettysburg,PG,1993,3.5

374,"     Unless you're familiar with Daniel Clowes' adult comic books, youmight think this black comedy is about the supernatural. It isn't. It's aboutthose plain, often-unnoticed folk who function out-of-the-mainstream. ThoraBirch (""American Beauty"") stars as Enid, a recent high-school grad who's decidedto skip college, find a job and get an apartment with her best-friend, Rebecca(Scarlett Johansson). But when she discovers she has to take a summer remedialart course to get her diploma, Enid's plans get derailed. The chaos begins whenthe girls wickedly fake a response to a personals ad and lure a lonely losernamed Seymour to a diner, thinking he's going to meet the girl of his dreams.Since he knows he can't relate to 99% of humanity, Seymour shows no outwardindignation, sipping a vanilla milkshake, patiently waiting. Peering throughhorned-rimmed glasses, utterly intrigued, Enid stalks him. ""He's such a cluelessdork, he's almost cool,"" she muses. She discovers he's obsessed with collectingvintage 78 rpm records and, significantly, that they have a lot in common. Atthe same time, her single father decides to move his girl-friend in, herrelationship with Rebecca deteriorates, her ""racist"" art class project turnsinto a local scandal, and she's deeply conflicted about her strange feelings forthirtysomething Seymour. Co-written by Daniel Clowes and director Terry Zwigoff(""Crumb""), the poignant, pessimistic cynicism fairly drips off the screen asThora Birch glides into the kind of rebellious role that Christina Ricci hasvacated. As the hypersensitive dork, Steve Buscemi is perfect, as is IlleanaDouglas, Scarlett Johansson, Bob Balaban and Brad Renfro. On the Granger MovieGauge of 1 to 10, ""Ghost World"" is a weird, satirical 8. It's an intriguingcoming-of-age story that haunts. ",Ghost World,R,2001,3
375," Throughout the running of Peter Webber's film ""Girl With aPearl Earring,"" no typically cultured member of the audiencecould avoid thinking of the words of Hamlet's famous soliloquy,""'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.""  This time,however, the consummation is not the gruesome one of deathbut of its opposite love a passion that simply cannot be fulfilled. ""The year's most painterly film, broadly shows what life musthave been like in the urban Holland of the mid-17th Century butmore specifically deals with both the ingredients that go into afine painting and, more important, a relationship that in aHollywood movie would climax in, well, climax, but in thisappropriately restrained treatment simply simmers.  A worldly,33-year-old married man of some artistic repute with a dozen orso kids in his Catholic family would hardly be expected to carryout a seduction with a seventeen-year-old who is illiterate,terminally shy and provincial, but the very impossibility of theirunion gives the film its frissons.     Webber, using Tracy Chevalier's 1998 novel adapted for thescreen by Olivia Hetreed who to her credit avoids using voice-overs that such a novel would ordinarily require performs atribute to the Dutch master, Johannes Vermeer by ensuring thathis photographer, Eduardo Serra, casts particularly the outdoorscenes as though they were themselves paintings executed byVermeer.     If you stroll through a museum, New York's Metropolitan,Madrid's Prado or The Hague's Maurithsuls and wonder  whatthe artists were thinking as they went about their creativeprofessions, you're not likely to come up with much that can beconfirmed historically.  This is rather the task of the novelist andfilm-maker: to employ imagination to convey possibilities. Forexample, in the titled work ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" whosefame arises largely from Vermeer's characterization of a youngwoman who projects sadness and happiness at the same time,we want to know particularly what is going through the mind ofthe subject who is sitting for the artistic creation.  This filmsuggests that very background.     ""Girl"" opens on Griet (Scarlett Johansson), plunged at the ageof 17 into what is for practical purposes an alien culture whenher father, a painter of tiles, goes blind.  Lacking education, shemust make her way as a maid, putting her into the Vermeerhousehold, a tumultuous residence whose noise levels,furnished by a large numbers of children (think of Shawn Levy'smovie ""Cheaper by the Dozen""), requires the man of the houseto isolate himself in his studio to concentrate on his work.  Timidto the point of looking away from people who address her,pursued by Pieter (Cillian Murphy), the son of the local butcherand later lusted after by the rich patron of the arts, Van Ruijven(Tom Wilkerson), Griet (pronounced Greet) unwittingly causesrampant jealousies when the painter's wife, the neuroticallybawling Catharina (Essie Davis), correctly assesses the eroticpower the teen has over her husband.  When Catharina isultimately betrayed by her own mother, the severe Maria Thins(Judy Parfitt), the largely sedate film comes to a maddeningclimax.     ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is filmed alternately with green andyellow filters as Webber opens us to the surroundings: thewoods, the filthy canal, the teeming marketplace populated bychickens, pigs, ducks, and one lovable dog.  In fact absent theanimals, the marketplace could be one in Amsterdam today,selling herrings, or the cheese market in the town of Gouda.Picturesque as olde Holland may be, this is not the kind of placethat most comfortable Westerners would choose tospend a week's vacation, given the odors carried by the canal ina place that has scant ideas of human sanitation.  A maid's lifein such a locale is not a happy one, particularly given thehostility a pretty young woman would inevitably arouse by hermere presence, her smooth-faced looks and callow charmarousing the attentions of Vermeer and his wealthy patron, theenmity of the painter's wife and twelve-year-old daughter, andthe surprising turnaround of the severe mother-in-law with herElizabethan collar and her perverse encouragement of theJohannes-Griet bond.     Scarlett Johansson is carving out a place for herself as aperformer who has already matched up to the comedic skills ofBill Murray in one my top ten picks this year, ""Lost inTranslation,"" while Colin Firth does a surprising turn as aconflicted artist who is unable to let loose with his usual,assertively romantic style.  Alexandre Desplat's John-Cage-likemusic adds to the baroque ambiance of the piece. ",Girl With a Pearl Earring,PG-13,2004,3.5
376,"Back in the '60s, 17 year-old Susanna Kaysen wound up inClaymoore, an upscale psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts, for morethan a year and used that experience to write a novel which fascinateddoe-eyed actress Winona Ryder enough to option it and make it intothis movie - in which she, of course, plays the dour, dreamy titlerole. It's an episodic memoir, at best, showcasing the acting acumenof Ms. Ryder as the passive, indecisive Susanna and, even more,Angelina Jolie as a ferociously vicious sociopath, along with CleaDuVall as a pathological liar, Elizabeth Moss as a severely scarredburn victim, and Brittany Murphy as a pampered, rich girl with aneating disorder and an overly attentive father. Vanessa Redgrave isimpressive as the chief psychiatrist. Problem is, Susanna Kaysen'sconfused mental state, diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder,is much like that of a lot of female adolescents - confused about herself-image, uncertain about her long-term goals, and struggling tomake sense of a rapidly changing world around her. Directed by JamesMangold (Heavy, Cop Land) from a script co-written by him, Lisa Loomerand Anna Hamilton Phelan, the implausibly detached, humorlessnarrative examines the boundaries between confinement and freedom,friendship and betrayal, madness and sanity, evolving into a femaleversion of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with no group dynamic.

The press kit proudly proclaims that itwon one of the many awards at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival.       GIRLS TOWN is also McKay's shot to earn a spot in the GuinnessBook of World Records.  By my estimate, approximately ninety-eightpercent of the sentences include the F word, and on several he was ableto make it be every other word in the sentence.  Certainly a recordalbeit perhaps not an enviable one.  Take out the F words and theparsimonious script just about vanishes.       Angela (Bruklin Harris), Emma (Anna Grace), and Patti (LiliTaylor) are three close friends who are about to graduate from an innercity high school.  Angela and Emma will be going to college, and Pattiwill stay home and raise her toddler.  Emma is so bright she will begoing to Columbia, but I did not catch where Angela is going.       One of their friends commits suicide, but it happens so suddenlythat any effect on the audience is muted.  Most of the time the girlsjust hang out together and make small talk, small filthy talk that is.It seems they despise just about everyone in their lives except eachother.  They carry markers, spray paint, and screwdrivers with them sothey can vandalize places wherever they go.  In the film they destroy acar and steal from an apartment, but the script attempts to justifytheir actions.       The girls are fond of cavorting in the school bathroom where theywrite graffiti on the walls while they talk.  If they are typicalcollege material, then no wonder the SAT scores keep dropping in ourcountry.       In one of the few good and poignant scenes in the show, Emma talksabout her experience with date rape.  Patti puts her down with acomment about that being typical so what is she complaining about.       The credits describe the film as ""a collaborative process.""  Thescript is credited to the actresses and the director.  It sounds likethere was no written script, and they ad-libbed most of the lines.  Toobad it didn't have some directing.  The actresses demonstrate littleenergy and almost no talent.  This is not to say they do not havetalent, but that there is little in evidence in this film.  The filmwanders around aimlessly like a ship without a rudder or a captain.       Parents and boyfriends hardly appear at all in the show and whenthey do, it is clear that they don't get it.  The girls are extremelyhostile to them.  When Angela gets expelled, her mom (Stephanie Berry)tells her, ""This is your life Angela.""  Angela sarcastically retorts,""Exactly.  My life.""       When Emma's boyfriend tries to talk to her and reason with her,she puts him down with, ""It's not what you say, it's what you think.""Kind of hard to win against that Orwellian logic.       Angela is also a poet.  One of her poems ends with, ""What you seeis what you get.  It ain't cheap.  It ain't free, but it's undeniablyme.""  As the ending credits roll, she says, ""I'd just like to get outof here.""  My sentiments exactly.       One final comment on the use of the F word in films.  I asked oneof the other critics at the screening about the plethora of F words init, and he said it did not bother him since that is how teenagers inNew York City talk.  True perhaps, but not enough justification for me.I love PULP FICTION and gave it my highest rating.  Other films likeGLENGARRY GLEN ROSS I also praised highly.  Both of these pictures arefull of the use of the F word, but in them the script was strong andthe F words were appropriate in the context.  Here, there is nothingbut cussing.  Take it away, and you have almost nothing left.       GIRLS TOWN runs 1:30.  It is rated R.  There is incessant foullanguage including a surfeit of F words.  There is some drug use, a lotof vandalism, but no sex or nudity.  I think it gives a horriblemessage to our teenagers so I hope as few as possible of them will eversee it.  I hated the film, and I give it 1/2 of a star only because Ihave seen worse. ",Girls Town,R,1996,0.5

Certainlythere hasn't been this kind of awesome sword-and-sandals spectaclesince ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Cleopatra.""  Set in 180 A.D., Croweplays Maximus, a Roman general who promises his aging mentor, CaesarMarcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) that, as his appointed successor, hewill return power to the Senate, thus restoring the Republic. Thatinfuriates Caesar's evil, envious son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), whobecomes Emperor and orders Maximus' execution. But Maximus escapes,becomes a slave and learns from an entrepreneur (Oliver Reed) howgladiators can fight their way to freedom and vengeance. That's whenthe excitement ignites. For years, Hollywood believed that historicalepics were too expensive; now, high-tech computer wizards candigitally revive that classic genre. Ridley Scott has cleverlyrecreated a mythic form in defiantly modern terms under the raw,realistic influence of ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" meaningthere's lots of gruesome, bloody carnage, plus surreal, dreamlikeglimpses of Elysium. What's most impressive is the gloriously detailedworld Scott creates on-screen, inhabited by characters whose emotionalmotivations come from a contemporary mentality. These are real peoplecoping with real problems in a brutal, superheroic setting. But thereare weaknesses in David Franzoni's story - like alluding to anunexplained affair between Maximus and Commodus's sister (ConnieNielsen) - and the overt, almost comic villainy of Joaquin Phoenix,whose power-hungry demeanor suggests a demented ""Richard III.""

379," This is a depressing film, and story.   But if you can get by all that, youought to appreciate some dynamite acting, the type that you hope to catch ona stage at least ONCE in your lifetime.  Like the play, to which this is faithful almost to the last letter, thispiece is one of David Mamet's best known pieces of work.  And while it isnot a fancy piece, or a Broadway piece of shlock, this is what the theatreloves to have around, as a chance to blow audiences all over, and allow theactors a chance to shine.  Glengarry Glen Ross is about just that.  It is the story of a few down and out real estate salesmen that are in oneoffice, who are at the end of their ropes.  Their selling abilities are nowmoved into a new style of hype and slickness, that underlies all thecharacters.  Only that these guys have not updated their game to the newways and styles.  It seems that this particular office is now relegated tothe junk departments, or to the lists that are left overs, and to try andsell some property to tenants that have been targeted for years, but havenever given in.  Downtown, all the salesmen are getting all the new leads.But here, they never see a new lead, because none of these guys has thetalent to sell them, or they have not sold anything in so long that theyhave forgotten how to sell.  And the characters panic, scream, talk, lie, and do what they can to bookthe client that might just get them a chance to try and sell one of theprime pieces of properties around, which are the new dwellings in GlengarryGlen.  And to this extent, one, two, or three, it is never really clear, ofthe salesmen, conspire to rob the office and steal the list of new leads,with the hope of getting a chance to sell one or two of those properties.  And the rest of the play is a series of moments trying to find out whoexactly did it, because the two who seemed to have planned it, may not havebeen involved in it at all.  The two acting jobs that stand out are Jack Lemmon ( Oscar Nomination ) andAl Pacino, the two aging selling superstars, now trying so hard to close yetanother deal which might save their job.  Accolades regarding their ability,and their smoothness, is just about impossible... there are not enough wordsto describe acting in this level.  The weakest part in this film, believe it or not, is the directing. As aplay, this is ready for ""movement"", and the lines has quite a bit of it, andthe characters use it very well.  The director is afraid to keep his camerastill, and many times gets caught off guard by the charging actor.  Theangularity with which David Mamet loves to work with, is not at all clearhere in this film, something which is readily visible on stage.  It moves insmallconcentric circles from this space to the next.  We might have been able toenjoy this better if we had just placed these actors in a building, toredown the fourth wall, and just turned the  camera on ... and watch them killthemselves trying so hard.  To make a close up, for emotionality's sakes, isun-necessary, and a bit of film idiom, that is wasted here.  But this film, despite a flaw that is questionable by this reviewer, stillis about the one thing that we need so much in this country. Live theatre...this is IT, at its finest.  If you ever wonder where these people learnedtheir craft, take a good look. ",Glengarry Glen Ross,R,1992,3
380," One of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director Sidney Lumet's ""Gloria,"" a remake of the 1980 John Cassavetes film, had absolutely no effect on me occurred when I was driving home from the theatre. Suddenly, I realized that since I had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before, I had not thought once about the film I had just invested nearly two hours of my life in. When a movie is over, aren't we supposed to think about it for a while, and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with? I thought so, but, for one, I saw this particular picture by myself, and #2, even if I had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place.  To be sure, ""Gloria"" begins with a stirring, rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters, in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it. Right before the men broke in, of course, his father gave him the disc to escape with. Eventually, the boy, named Nicky Nunez (Jean-Luke Figueroa), is caught by the mobsters, and taken back to their apartment.Meanwhile, Gloria (Sharon Stone) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend (Jeremy Northam) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime. When he refuses to give it to her, and then hears the group of men talking about killing Nicky, she leaves with him in order to save his life, but not before holding the men at gunpoint, stealing all of their money, and forcing them to strip nude. Gloria is the type of fast-talking, smart-mouthed New Yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people, and she never expected to be stuck with a kid, but she has a heart of gold (don't they always in this type of movie) and is only trying to protect the boy, whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with.  The previous incarnation of ""Gloria"" by Cassavetes and starring the luminous Gena Rowlands, remains unseen by me, but was no doubt superior, even though I can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one, regardless of the director or stars. There is no doubt in my mind that director Lumet has stuck closely to the original, but the film itself is simply lifeless, with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch. I liked, for example, a very funny climactic sequence where Gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at, and keeps turning the car around, then driving a little ways, then slamming on the brakes and turning around again. These bright moments, however, appear long and far between, and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between Nicky and Gloria, which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers. Throughout, my mind was repeatedly asking the question, ""who really cares?""  As Gloria, Sharon Stone has adopted an over-the-top Brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all. In the beginning, in fact, I was amazed at how amateurish Stone's performance was, but as the film progressed she got better. Although not one of her better turns, Stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored. Jean-Luke Figeroa was fine as Nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag. All other actors who appeared were considerably wasted, none more than Cathy Moriarty, an entertaining actress in her own right, who is billed fourth and has all of one scene, as Gloria's friend whom she turns to for help.   Sony, the studio that released ""Gloria,"" obviously does not have any faith in the film, and I don't blame them. They declined to screen the picture for critics, which is never a good sign, particularly with the high-profile people involved. Although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is (just look at the spectacular ""In Dreams,"" which failed to even make the Top 10 last week), I have a suspicion ""Gloria"" is going to vanish from theaters faster than ""Ishtar,"" judging from the opening night 7:00 p.m. showing I saw it at, where there were about ten to fifteen people present, counting myself. Although Stone can be an impressive actress (just watch her in 1995's ""Casino"" or 1996's ""Last Dance"" if you don't believe me) and Sidney Lumet can be a respectable director, there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of ""Gloria"" was worth remaking or, for that matter, why Columbia Pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful. ",Gloria,R,1999,1.5
381,"Running close to four hours, including intermission, this landmark epicof the Civil War is, basically, a television mini-series released as a featurefilm. Adapted from Jeff Shaara's best-selling novel and prequel to ""Gettysburg,""it covers early 1861 through 1863, detailing with precision how the earlybattles between the citizen-soldiers unfolded. While the story begins withGeneral Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) being forced to choose between allegianceto his country and loyalty to his home state of Virginia, the narrative revolvesaround Lee's devoutly religious Confederate colleague, General Thomas""Stonewall"" Jackson (Stephen Lang), who was wounded by his own men atChancellorsville and died of pneumonia. On the Union side, there's ColonelJoshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels), a professor at Bowdoin College inMaine. Admittedly, this is historical fiction but the realities of combat arevividly shown.     Writer/director Ronald Maxwell steers his actors into abandoning the20th century naturalistic method to which we're accustomed and returning to anearlier technique of declaiming their lines. As a result, the military leadersoften sound as if they're delivering a formal oration, rather than conversing.Mia Dillon is notable as Jane Beale whose family is caught in the Battle ofFredericksburg, while Kali Rocha is Jackson's wife and Mira Sorvino is lessconvincing as Chamberlain's wife. Tycoon Ted Turner does a cameo as a jovialofficer at a Confederate camp show - and credit goes to more than 7,500enthusiastic Civil War ""re-enactors"" who lend authenticity. On the Granger MovieGauge of 1 to 10, ""Gods and Generals"" is a robust yet exhausting 6. Wait for itstelevision debut - and watch history come to life. ",Gods and Generals,PG-13,2003,1.5
382," James ""Jimmy"" Whale, once appropriately given the sobriquet of ""the fatherof horror,"" launched the monster movie craze in the early 1930s withFRANKENSTEIN, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and THE INVISIBLE MAN.  GOD ANDMONSTERS, set in the 1950s, tells the story of the last period of his life.  Alternatively witty, poignant, insightful and surprising, the film relatesthe story of a man's life by focusing on its ending, while keeping theflashbacks to a minimum.  Whale, played with an Oscar caliber performance byIan McKellen, was an eccentric and a loner.  An avowed homosexual, at a timewhen few admitted it publicly, Whale dropped out of the active Hollywoodscene.  Living in an uncommonly modest house by Hollywood standards, he kepthimself busy painting amazingly accurate copies of great masterpieces.  Cast opposite McKellen, who was last seen in APT PUPIL as a retired Nazi, isBrendan Fraser, last seen crashing into trees in GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.Although the choice of Fraser to go opposite Sir Ian may seem a bit odd, itworks.  Comedic actor Fraser, who has played serious parts before, as inSCHOOL TIES, makes us expect much less than we get.  He gives his charactercharisma and a subtle complexity.  Fraser plays Clayton Boone, Jimmy's big oaf of a gardener.  Clayton, who hasthe rippling muscles of a Greek god, lives in an old trailer and drives abeat-up truck.  He's an ex-marine who has a big, patriotic tattoo to remindhimself of his time in the service.  An avowed heterosexual, Clayton feels uneasy but yet drawn to Jimmy, whotells him fascinating inside stories about the making of movies.  He says,for example, that Boris Karloff was a proper English actor but wasdreadfully dull.  And he tells much more controversial stories too, like theinside scoop on George Cukor and his sex-with-young-boys scandal.  Even with his reservations, Clayton becomes both Jimmy's friend and artistmodel.  The natural chemistry between them doesn't follow conventionalpatterns.  Besides the obvious physical attraction, Jimmy is also drawn toClayton because of their similar childhood economic status.  Jimmy grew up in a large family where they lived four to a bed and with aprivy out back.  They used ""drippings,"" i.e., congealed beef juices thatthey kept in a jar, to put on toast instead of butter.  His father, whom heloathed, made him work in the factories at hard labor from an early age.""Hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive,"" Jimmy says of hisfather, who treated him badly.  Jimmy served in the foxholes in World War I, and he was as scarredemotionally by this as much as his childhood.  Both of these parts of hislife keep flashing into in his mind.  The movie contains old film footage of Jimmy's classic movies as well asreconstructions of their shootings.  Although these form the heart of GODAND MONSTERS, there are many wonderfully little odd ball incidents as well.Typical of these is the obviously gay reporter who doesn't have much respectfor Jimmy's talents but has come for a pro forma interview of him.  Jimmy,who finds his trivial questions boring, decides to make a game of theinterview.  Jimmy tells him that he will answer any questions whatsoeverthat the reporter poses so long as the reporter takes off a piece ofclothing for every question.  As a character out of left field, Lynn Redgrave, with a thick EasternEuropean accent, plays Jimmy's disapproving maid.  Although she loves Jimmy,she is full of ""tsk, tsk, tsk"" for his behavior.  She's sure he's going torot in hell for his proclivities.  Based on Christopher Bram's novel, written and lovingly directed by BillCondon, the film touches us with its honest and poignant portrayal of afascinating individual.  ""Alone, bad; friend, good"" Frankenstein says at the end of his movie.Jimmy, a loner, didn't have many friends, but he certainly cherished the fewhe did have.  And Clayton was glad to be counted among them.  GODS AND MONSTERS runs 1:45.  It is not rated but would be an R for sex,profanity and mature subject matter and would be fine for older and matureteenagers. ",Gods and Monsters,R,1998,3.5
383," I hate assigning star ratings to movies. The underlying implication, that filmgoers are too lazy to actually read a review, is insulting and besides that, assigning stars is a pain. When a film is clearly and consistently good (""The Truman Show"") or an obvious dud (""Meet The Deedles"") the process is easy. It's those in-between films, the ones with both great and dreadful moments, that really make the process difficult. Which brings us to ""Godzilla.""  After being subjected to a staggering amount of hype for over a year, it's easy to forget that ""Godzilla"" is, after all,  just a monster movie. Although the genre has produced a few undeniable classics, such as ""King Kong"" and ""Jaws,"" for the most part, monster movies remain guilty pleasures. You enter the theater prepared to suffer through long stretches of dull plotting and silly dialogue in exchange for a few really cool fight scenes with a big, bad-ass monster. Although I haven't seen the original ""Godzilla,"" an Americanized version of the 1954 Japanese film ""Gojira,"" since my childhood, I clearly remember how thrilling the monster was, and that the rest of the film was as ponderous as Raymond Burr during his ""Ironside"" days.   The new ""Godzilla"" is a lot like that. In the hands of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the team responsible for ""Independence Day,"" ""Godzilla"" is an absolute hoot when the creature is onscreen, and pretty bad when it isn't. The film's slogan is ""Size Does Matter."" Wrong. Devlin and Emmerich's sloppy, sprawling film reinforces another old axiom, that size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts. The boys have whipped up a great looking monster and the battle scenes are terrific, but they don't have a clue when it comes to plotting, pacing and logic. Of course, despite the film's many flaws, I still plan to see it again as soon as possible. That's how nifty the creature effects are.  The story is very simple. Godzilla appears. A lot of movie archetypes with conflicting motives chase him. New York gets trashed as the military battles the monster. Just when you think it's over, something else happens. Just when you think it's over again, something else happens. The end. Well, until the sequel.  Over the course of Godzilla's long career, the monster changed from villain to hero and the movies became incredibly campy. Thankfully, Devlin and Emmerich avoid the cheese factor, playing things straight in terms of the creature. The film's humor, both intentional and unintentional, comes from the humans, not Godzilla. Neither hero nor villain, Godzilla simply behaves like an animal. A very, very large animal.  As for the look, forget about stunt men in rubber suits. This Godzilla actually looks like a giant lizard, thanks to some killer special effects. Lithe and agile, Godzilla moves convincingly, with a real sense of weight, bulk and power. It travels so quickly that firing military troops keep missing, inadvertently destroying almost as much of New York as the monster. Scenes of the creature racing through the city are great fun, a reward for all the phony looking monsters we've endured in past films.  Unfortunately, endurance is still a factor. In order to see Godzilla in all of it's glory, we have to suffer through long stretches of inane filler material, with a talented cast forced to spout a lot of hokey dialogue. Matthew Broderick is the idealistic young scientist in the center of things. Maria Pitillo annoys as a conniving reporter (in movies, is there any other kind?) and Broderick's ex-girlfriend, weighing the film down with a time-consuming, totally unnecessary love story. Hank Azaria has his moments as a gonzo photographer, although his character is laden with relationship baggage as well. Actually, only two cast members really get a chance to shine. Jean Reno has a powerful presence as a French agent pursuing Godzilla, and ""NewsRadio's"" Vicki Lewis adds welcome bite to a minor role as a scientist.   The rest of the film is peopled with cartoons, a fat, reactionary mayor (named Ebert, the filmmakers' little thumbs down at the famed critic,) a self-absorbed TV anchorman, a soldier in way over his head, etc., etc. If Devlin and Emmerich want to truly become masters of ""event"" movies, they need to learn how to focus on the event instead of tired subplots and clich_d, superfluous characters. A little more attention to internal logic wouldn't hurt either. For example, the impact of an exciting chase scene is lessened by the ludicrous notion that a cab could outrun Godzilla.    Ultimately, your tolerance of all the crap in ""Godzilla"" will depend on how much of a monster fan you are.  As for me, despite it's lumbering storyline, terrible pacing and disposable characters, I still had fun. Now how do you assign stars to that? ",Godzilla,PG-13,1998,2
384,"In Takao Okawara's GODZILLA 2000, Godzilla may have met his match insomething that looks like a flying piece of fossilized dino dung in theshape of the Millennium Falcon.  But since this is the 23rd Japanese filmabout Godzilla, the smart money is on Godzilla to win again. When we first see Godzilla in his millennium edition, he is on his usualpower trip, knocking over electrical lines left and right.  After noshing onmetal delicacies like ships and bridges, he is ready to fight all comers.The Japanese army has developed a special metal piercing missile that theyfigure is certain to take down their old nemesis, but the bombs aren't evenstrong enough to give the thick-skinned monster a case of heartburn. Yes sirree, after being bored with Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA, prepared withzillions of dollars' worth of computer generated images, we are back tobasics with this Japanese version of a guy in a rubber suit.  The Englishdubbing is so unsynchronized that it appears that they intended it tomismatch as another way to generate laughs.   When our two mega-villains square off in the obligatory, ending battle tothe death, their weapons of choice are classic.  Against Godzilla's dinosaurbreath, his competition resorts to the evil eye.   The biggest problem with GODZILLA 2000 is that it is just not cheesy enough.And we waste a lot of time waiting for Godzilla to get back on stage.  Howmany breaks does a man in a rubber suit need? Although the humans in the story mainly hang around gawking or shooting atthe monster, sometimes their hokey dialog does add some zest to the story'scampy ambiance.  ""Are you sure you've still got film in the camera?"" asksscientist Yuji Shinoda (Takehiro Murata) to his female companion, as theyare hot on Godzilla's trail.  ""Oh, bite me!"" she shoots back.   The problem with GODZILLA 2000 is that, like wasabi, a little goes a longway.  Thirty minutes would have been plenty for me. GODZILLA 2000 runs 1:30.

That may be why I had a perverse curiosity about thisnew Jerry Bruckheimer action/thriller. Written by Scott Rosenberg(""Con Air"") and directed by TV-commercial veteran Dominic Sena(""Kalifornia""), it stars Nicolas Cage as ""Memphis"" Raines, a mastercar thief. Back in his heyday, there was no vehicle he couldn't heistin 60 seconds. He's ostensibly retired until his kid brother Kip,played by Giovanni Ribisi, is in mortal danger. That brings him backinto the grim world of crime and fear for one last, intensehigh-stakes heist. He and his hastily re-assembled gang of seasonedexperts, teamed up with Kip's younger crowd, must steal 50 prized cars- as Robert Duvall does the tally. Angelina Jolie plays a tough,Ferrari-loving mechanic who was romantically involved withMemphis. Delroy Lindo is the L.A. police auto-theft detective who'sdetermined to arrest Memphis, while Christopher Eccleston is thevicious villain. The inventive car chases with expert stunt driversare amazing, particularly on the bridge linking Long Beach and SanPedro. Car thieves give their prey girl's names so the mythical staris ""Eleanor,"" a pewt er 1967 Shelby Mustang GT 500 with blackstripes.

With the twostars from Nickelodeon's TV series ""All That,"" the film provokesconstant laughter.  Although the adults may be somewhat surprised, andperhaps a bit embarrassed, at how hard they laugh at the story'sridiculous humor, the six to eleven year old target audience will haveno such reservations.       ""Welcome to the Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, can I takeyour order?"" chirps the extremely likable guy with the ""I'm Ed"" button.Ed, whose IQ might be too low to measure, is played with a sweetcharisma by Kel Mitchell.  The other half of the ""All That"" series,Kenan Thompson, plays the somewhat brighter kid named Dexter.  WhereasEd is so dedicated to his fast-food position that he sleeps and evenshowers in his Good Burger pen stripe uniform and hat, Dexter is justthere to make enough money to pay off the damages he caused to the carof his teacher, Mr. Wheat.       Sinbad clearly enjoys playing the minor role of Mr. Wheat.  Withthe world's worst Afro hair and outfits with sequined, foot longlapels, Mr. Wheat remains firmly stuck in the 70s.       Ed's stupidity borders on legendary status.  (""If you ask me, theguy's a few tacos short of a combination plate,"" is how one characterso aptly puts it.)  When a customer complains that the hamburger heordered ""with nothing on it"" was just a bun, he yells at Ed, ""I'mreporting your name to the manager!""  Ed, with his raspy BillPaxton-style voice, incongruously explains, ""The manager already knowsmy name.""       Later in the film when Ed is threatened with, ""You better watchyour butt!"", he spins around trying.  ""I give up,"" he finallyconcludes.  ""There is no way a guy can watch his own butt.""       The heart of the film is the war between Good Burger and the newcompetition across the street, Mondo Burger. Mondo Burger is run by thenefarious Kurt, played by Jan Schweiterman as a cross between a Naziand a cult leader.       Steven Jordan's candy-colored design for Mondo Burger is exactlyhow Disney might redesign a Planet Hollywood to bulk it up and make itmore playful.  Natasha Landau's costumes include shiny plasticjumpsuits with big zippers for the Mondo Burger staff.  The resultinglook reminds one of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.       First-time screen writers Kevin Kopelow and Dan Schneider went fora completely outlandish comedy without a hint of social relevance, andthey succeeded.  People all around us were laughing hard and often,albeit not as much in the second half when the show begins to run outof fresh gags and falls back a few times on that perennial favorite ofslapstick, food fights.  But even then, director Brian Robbins managesto find new ways to stage them.       This terminally silly film has an undeniable charm.

387,"We hear stories all the time about young people who aredepressed, who try suicide, whose raging hormones give themno peace and who can't wait to grow up more and becomenormal.  My own experience with men and women in theclassroom and out on the ball field is that most are regular guys,fairly rational, and are eager to plan their futures like anyone tenyears older.  Nonetheless there are some who are taken by J.D.Salinger's classic ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" about this HoldenCaulfield preppie who has contempt for the world, who isexcessively judgmental, who doesn't fit in and winds upinstitutionalized.  This is not the kind of person you want toemulate and you may not think much of the author's own lifestyle, but then happy, adjusted people don't usually make fordeep domestic drama while the characters in ""The Good Girl""do.  And Mike White, who is quite talented as both a writer andactor (his offbeat gem ""Chuck and Buck,"" made for just a half amil two years back, was directed by the same fellow whohelmed ""The Good Girl""), provides witty, sincere, believabledialogue for his small-town Texas characters this time aroundas well. ""The Good Girl"" is about the fatal attraction that Tom ""Holden""Worther (Jake Gyllenhaal) has for a co-worker, Justine Last(Jennifer Aniston) who rides the cash register a few metersaway from his own in The Retail Rodeo a clone of Woolworth'sthat dominates the generic mall of the town.  Worther is theessential hero of Salinger's novel, which he reads and re-readswhen the cash registers are not singing. He insists on beingcalled Holden and has an I.D. tag to establish his truer self.  Atjust the right moment that both he and Justine realize that theyare leading lives of quiet desperation and itch to get out of theirrut, they take their lunchtime talks up a few notches to the localmotel.  Trouble is that  is married for the last seven years to apothead house painter, Phil (John C. Reilly) and has to put upeach night with her man's vapid conversations with his bestfriend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).  As the conflicted  preparesto bolt her life with a guy eight years her junior a young manwho is no Tadpole but rather a drunk, a college dropout, aloser the coils of a Greek-style tragedy tighten. But unlike Greek tragedy, ""The Good Girl"" is down-to-earth,with Miguel Arteta coaching comic vignettes from his mostlysympathetic characters.  Mike White's dialogue is spot on forside characters like Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel), the heavilymade-up but sardonic and creative announcer of sales at theRodeo's microphone; like Corny (Mike White), a security guardwho tries to persuade Justine to join his weekly Bible studygroup; like Tim Blake Nelson as Phil's best friend with morethan platonic interest in Justine; and John C. Reilly, a housepainter who looks content smoking pot but gives away his realfeelings when during a heavy rainstorm he states that he wishesfor a deluge so that he would never have to paint again. Jennifer Aniston is best of all in a role playing more or lessagainst character.  Not here do we find her in the superficiallyamusing roles that he inhabited in Edward Burns's ""She's theOne"" and in Mike Judge's hilarious 1999 movie ""Office Space."" With her hair in a bun that proclaims her girl-next-door goodlooks and her eyes gazing into yet another daydream of anescape from the banality of small-town life, she holds up as awoman who could be the object of any sensitive guy's affection;a good girl whose lust combines with her disaffection to causeserious trouble in her marriage and in the lives of no smallnumber of people in the neighborhood.","Good Girl, The",R,2002,3.5
388,"Long time ago the author of this review has fallen in lovewith Australian cinema. This was due to the group of verytalented Australian film directors that made plenty ofextraordinary films in relatively short period of time frommid 1970s to early 1980s. Many of those directors latercontinued their respective careers in Hollywood, usuallyfailing to reach the high standards that they had set whileworking in their native country. One of them was BruceBeresford and, although he had been somewhat more successfulthan the rest of his countrymen, he had his share offailures and disappointments. One of them is GOOD MAN INAFRICA, 1994 screen adaptation of satirical novel by WilliamBoyd.  Protagonist of the film is Morgan Leaffy (played by ColinFliers), low-level British diplomat recently assigned to thepost in newly independent African state of Kinjaja. For himthe mission in African hellhole is equal to punishment, buthis problems are only starting when he receives an importanttask from his ambitious boss Arthur Fenshawe (played by JohnLithgowe). He must convince country's Professor Adenkule(played by Louis Gossett Jr.), country's most powerfulpolitician, to give lucrative oil-drilling rights to Britishcompany. Another problem is local superstition that riskscreate major diplomatic scandal. Leaffy's efforts to solvethose problems are hindered by his own womanising habits andsome really embarrassing health issues. The only person whomight aid Leaffy is Dr. Alex Murray (played by SeanConnery), altruistic Scottish physician.  Despite having truly impressive international cast andnovel's author William Boyd working on the screenplay, GOODMAN IN AFRICA is a big disappointment. It seems that someoneor something sucked out entire satirical edge out of theoriginal novel. What remained is the bunch of dislikeablecharacters with whom the audience can't sympathise. Thatincludes even Sean Connery, who, despite playing the mostnoble of the characters, never had less likeable screenpersonality. The only remarkable thing about this isBeresford's colour-blindness in such approach - the samemisanthropic vitriol in which he painted British as formercolonial masters is reserved for their subjects, portrayedeither as superstitious savages or shrewd cleptocrats. Thequality of humour in the film leaves much to be desired, andthe ending is especially disappointing. All in all, GOOD MANIN AFRICA is a film bearable to watch, but hardly anythingabove it. ","Good Man In Africa, A",R,1994,1
389," Coming-of-age stories are almost always about men and there's a good reason for that. Despite all the hype about how far men have evolved from the old days, the truth is that most of us haven't. We've read about how contemporary men express their emotions instead of bottling everything up, but we don't quite know how to do that. So we still try to be tough, yet accessible; stoic and cool. We strive to live up to some vague male ideal that probably never existed, and we feel like frauds. Coming-of-age films are invaluable because they give us a chance to vicariously grow up all over again.   Which brings us to ""Good Will Hunting,"" a rich, rewarding coming-of-age tale starring Will Damon and Robin Williams. The screenplay, written by Damon and his co-star and boyhood friend Ben Affleck (""Chasing Amy,"" ""Going All The Way"",) is reminiscent of other male-bonding films, notably ""Ordinary People"" and ""Dead Poets Society,"" but quite emotionally satisfying in its own right. Their portrait of a lost young man whose unresolved pain triggers explosive outbursts, and the two father figures who battle over his soul, hits all the right notes. Under the assured hand of director Gus Van Sant (""My Own Private Idaho,"" ""Drugstore Cowboys"") even the maudlin parts of the story retain an emotional clarity. Like ""Hoosiers,"" ""Good Will Hunting"" takes a well-worn theme and makes it seem fresh, thanks to exceptional acting and solid, three-dimensional storytelling.    Will Hunting (Damon) is a scrappy young tough from South Boston's Irish ghetto who works as a janitor at a prestigious university. A mathematical genius with a photographic memory, Hunting has no direction, spending his time pounding beer and exchanging mock insults with his buddies, particularly his best friend Chuckie (Affleck.) When MIT Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard from ""Breaking The Waves"") spots the boy casually solving an advanced math problem, he pursues Hunting, only to find him jailed for assaulting a police officer. Lambeau arranges to take the troubled kid under his wing, with two conditions. Hunting must do math work with the professor and agree to participate in therapy for his antisocial behaviors. Following several disastrous attempts to match the boy with a therapist, Lambeau finally turns to Sean McGuire (Williams,) a psychology professor at a small community college. McGuire, who grew up in the same neighborhood as Hunting, tries to help the boy confront his inner demons, only to find his own painful memories stirred up as well. Further complicating matters is Hunting's awkward courtship of Skylar (Minnie Driver,) a wealthy Harvard senior preparing for medical school.  For men seeking to vicariously relive their adolescence, Will Hunting is the perfect flawed hero. Rakishly handsome and as fast with his tongue as he is with his fists, Hunting has limitless potential, if he can only break through his own emotional barriers. To make the wish-fulfillment scenario complete, he is surrounded by a support system most people only dream of; a group of loving, encouraging pals, a smart, charming girlfriend, and two, count 'em, two father figures trying to help the kid better himself. In lesser hands, this material could have been unbearably mawkish, but thankfully, Damon and Affleck's script balances the angst with loads of earthy humor to keep the proceedings grounded. That, coupled with Van Sant's confident direction and some powerhouse acting, helps ""Good Will Hunting"" to pay off in grand fashion.   Matt Damon, who made quite an impression in ""The Rainmaker,"" gives a breakthrough performance here. Possessed with tousled good looks and a killer smile, the charismatic actor is utterly convincing as a super-intellect, while maintaining the character's working-class sensibilities. He's really quite remarkable here. Robin Williams does admirable work as well, showing what a fine actor he can be when he restrains himself. As the wounded professor, Williams projects great strength and defiance, tempered by a gentle, caring nature. The chemistry that slowly builds between him and Damon is electrifying.  As Skylar, Minnie Driver has an earthy charm that comes from her willingness to completely let down her guard. Whether telling a dirty joke to the guys at a bar, or breaking into tears in the darkness, she possesses a bracing sense of honesty. It's easy to understand why Hunting is drawn to her.  Also good are Skarsgard as the driven math professor and Affleck as Hunting's closest friend. In fact, there isn't a bad performance to be found in the film. The strong acting, along with Van Sant's ability to make the South Boston setting feel authentic, allows ""Good Will Hunting"" to triumph over its occasional moments of excess sentimentality. Cynics may dismiss the film as an overly effusive festival of male-bonding, but for the rest of us, this is just the catharsis we need. ",Good Will Hunting,R,1997,3.5
390,"Who hasn't speculated about the link between news and gossip?At least, that's the premise for a college journalism class assignmentproposed by ""professor"" Eric Bogosian.  And three students - JamesMarsden, Lena Headley, and Norman Reedus - decide to test histheories. One night at a drunken, off-campus party, Marsden sees abeautiful, wealthy, virginal freshman, played by Kate Hudson (GoldieHawn's real-life daughter), making out on a bed with JoshuaJackson. Hudson calls it quits before she passes out, but Marsdendecides to start an ""experimental"" rumor that she's ""put out"" forJackson. It's kind of like ""Cruel Intentions"" goes to college. Theslanderous story spreads quickly throughout the university, soonacquiring salacious details, including a black rubber bra. But then itturns ugly, implicating that Jackson took advantage of Hudson aftershe passed out, not before, which leads to his subsequentarrest. Working from a taut, tension-filled screenplay by GregoryPoirier and Theresa Rebeck, ""NYPD Blue,"" ""ER"" director DavidGuggenheim explores and exploits the date rape concept, bringing inSharon Lawrence as an angry cop and Edward James Olmos as a homicidedetective. It's an intriguing, dangerous premise but the executionlacks believability. Why wouldn't any suspected rape victim undergo amedical examination? What accredited college would allow Bogosian torant and rave in class? Which students can live in such anextravagantly hip loft? And why would these distraught people talk andbehave in such an incomprehensible way?  On the Granger Movie Gauge of1 to 10, ""Gossip"" is nasty, tawdry, inept 3.

391,"""The Governess"" is writer-director Sandra Goldbacher'sBritish answer to Agnes Merlet's Italian-centered ""Artemisia."" While ""Artemisia"" deals with the first woman who made aliving by painting in Italy, ""The Governess"" is a (fictionalized)interpretation of Britain's first female career photographer. Wielding vivid but realistic color when Ashley Rowe's camerafocuses on an almost subterranean society in London, thelens takes on a cold, harsh conviction when it travels to theremote and uncharitable Scottish island of Arran, a piece ofgodforsaken territory that must seem alien even to its lifelongresidents.     ""The Governess,"" which takes place in the 1840's, is thestory of Rosina Da Silva (Minnie Driver), a woman of greatEnglish patience who grows up in the Sephardic Jewishcommunity of London, where she enjoys a happy andprosperous life amid a people generally shunned by theAnglican majority.   She jokes readily with her conventionalsister.  In one scene, the two young women ponder thepossible taste of semolina, a dessert enjoyed by Gentiles,which they agree looks somewhat like semen.  ""I'd like to seesemen but not as a drink,"" Rosina announces to her sib, whois shocked even that Rosina had once kissed her boyfriendBenjamin though they are ""not married.""  When Rosina'sloving father is murdered, we understand that the estate is indebt.  To support her mother and sister, Rosina must findemployment, but in an anti-Semitic Britain, what will she do? As she is educated, she takes the job of governess, aprestigious profession which, along with prostitution, was oneof the few careers open to women.  But to acquire andmaintain the position, she must pose as a Gentile (not difficultfor one who aspires to the stage), and even then, she mustre-locate to a manor on the bleak Scottish island of Skye.     As she puts it, writer-director Goldbacher, herself a productof an Italian Jewish father and a mother from the Isle of Skye,is interested primarily in taking ""a character out of one reallystrongly defined, close-knit, vivid culture into another world,and look at what it would be like for her to fall in love withsomeone from this other culture, while also denying her ownidentity.""  From the looks of things, Rosina--now known by thename Mary Blackchurch--has quite a conflict on her hands. On the one hand she finds it difficult to accept the exoticculture of non-Jews whose remoteness keeps her feeling anoutlander.  On the other hand, she enjoys her first sexualrelationship, one which both destroys her stereotype ofGentiles as a distant people and reconfirms her expectationsof them.  Striking a feminist attitude, one which projects bothstrength of character and vulnerability to hurt, Minnie Drivergives an Oscar-caliber performance as a woman who takes adeep interest in the traditionally masculine profession ofchemistry as she becomes involved in the experimentation ofher employer, Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson), one ofEngland's first photographers.  With no background in thefield, the clever Rosina impresses Cavendish by providing theclue he needs to fix the camera's images on paper while atthe same time freeing the repressed gentleman from hissexual limitations.  Much of the humor comes from Ms.Driver's thoughts, which provide some narration to the tale, aswhen she assesses the patronizing Mrs. Cavendish (HarrietWalter) as a woman who ""seems as though she has a lemonup her posterior.""  Florence Hoath turns in a cuteperformance as Clementina, the thirteen-year-old spoiled bratwho is tamed by her governess while Tom Wilkinson showshis flexibility this year by playing both an enraged homophobein ""Wilde"" and a tormented, obsessed scientist in ""TheGoverness.""     Urban audiences will be pleased by Goldbacher's view ofcountry estates, in which wealthy patrons allegedly enjoy theirlives in quiet and splendor.  Mrs. Cavendish is, after all, boredout of her mind; their son Henry (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) isdisturbed enough to be thrown out of college; and Mr.Cavendish is oppressed by the surroundings.  Even whenreturning to her cholera-embattled digs in London, Rosina--who has lost her mother to a disease that is ravishing the city--realizes that there's no place like home.  Minnie Driver finallyhas the role of her career; one that utilizes her considerableacting talent and the dark Mediterranean features which haveallowed performers like Joe Mantegna (in ""Homicide"") andJohn Turturro (in ""The Truce"") to achieve splendid turns asJews.  The sound track of Sephardic songs is mesmerizing,as is the rest of the picture.",Governess,R,1998,2
392,"      I have no doubt that GRAND CANYON will be my best movie of 1991.This was a movie about how the chance happenings in your life canfundamentally alter your life forever.  It especially dealt with thechance meeting of people who might become inseparable to you.       What is the plot of GRAND CANYON?  Hard to say.  It is about a lotof things.  There is a mugging, a rescue, a lost baby, a found baby,getting involved with gangs, getting away from gangs, falling out oflove with your wife, falling into love with your wife, being scared ofsomeone of other race, becoming bosom buddies with someone of anotherrace, and so and so forth.  In short it is about life.  GRAND CANYON isset in LA, but it could have been set anywhere.  The movie's titlecomes from a wish of one of the characters played by Danny Glover.       It was most of all a film full of wonderful characters that youwould like personally to meet.  The dialog (Lawrence Kasdan and MegKasdan) was always incredible.  I hope the writers get the Oscar forit.  The directing is super.  It was done by Lawrence Kasdan who didTHE BIG CHILL, and you can think of it as a much more serious and heavyBIG CHILL.  Alternatively, you can view it as updated BIG CHILL for the90s.       GRAND CANYON is full of characters and full of events that makeyou think of real life and not movies.  Where else could you have along scene about the absolute fear of teaching a young boy to drive.Imagine a left turn against heavy traffic that is really scary andrealistic and not the laugh track version you have come to expect.       This is also a quite scary movie with a fair amount of fear andblood.  A subtheme is the violence in society in general and in LA inparticular.  As parents who are trying without much luck to have  asecond child, the episode of finding the baby and keeping it was reallytouching.  Yet this was a life affirming and fundamentally happy moviethat made you want to immediately give your spouse (and children andfriends) a big hug.       The actors (Danny Glover as Simon, Kevin Kline as Mack, SteveMartin as Davis, Mary McDonnell as Claire, Mary-Louise Parker as Dee,and Alfre Woodard as Jane) are in top form.  I had no idea Steve Martincould be an articulate and serious character.  There is one very badside to the show: It ends! The ending is fine and not abrupt yet Iwanted to go on for hours.  I love these people.       GRAND CANYON runs 2:15 which might be too long in a lessorpicture, but here I wish the editor Carol Littleton had included evenmore footage.  Moreover, I hope that someday the producers (MichaelGrillo, Lawrence Kasdan, Charles Okun) will do a GRAND CANYON IIbecause I need to know how these new friends of mine from this movieare doing.  GRAND CANYON is rated R for some reason and I guess it isthe fear and the bad language.  Certainly it would be fine for anyteenager.  I recommend this film strongly to everyone over the age of12 and award it my top rating of ****. ",Grand Canyon,R,1992,4
393,"Every now and then Hollywood studio executives realise that the audiences get tired of old formulas and want something different. This is the conclusion drawn by one of the protagonists of THE GREAT WHITE HYPE, 1996 satire directed by Reginald Hudlin. Reveredn Frank Sultan (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is flamboyant promoter for James ""The Grim Reaper"" Roper (played by Damon Wayans), unbeaten boxing champion. Roper was so effective in disposing of contenders that the audiences and television revenue began to vanish. Sultan concludes that the main reason is in public being bored with one black man knocking out another black man in twenty seconds. His solution to this problem is in a contender who happens to be white. Perfect candidate Terry Conklin (played by Peter Berg), lead singer for obscure Cleveland hard rock band. Ten years ago Conklin managed to beat Roper in amateur fight. Conklin has long forgotten boxing but Sultan appeals to his idealism and care about the world's homeless. In exchange for 10 million US$ Conklin agrees to become a contender and later watches as Sultan shamelessly panders to lowest racist sentiments in order to attract crowds.  The plot of THE GREAT WHITE HYPE touches some potentially stingy issues like the race relations in contemporary America and some plot elements and characters have a striking resemblance to some real life personalities and situations (Don King, Mike Tyson). The movie therefore had the potential of being a serious exploration of the subject or truly devastating satire. It had more potential in the form of Ron Shelton, screenwriter who had used his inside knowledge of US professional sports to make some remarkable films in the past. Unfortunately, he was paired by not-so-talented co-writer Tony Hendra and the script was given to Reginald Hudlin, director whose skills in making comedy could recently be seen in SERVING SARA. Not even such charismatic actors like Samuel L. Jackson can rescue a film which is populated by dislikeable characters the audience couldn't care less about. The promising premise is ruined by humour that panders to the racist stereotypes. Most of the jokes aren't particularly funny and the biggest one happens in the end. When the film abruptly ends the audience would feel just like those boxing fans who had expected spectacle and saw twenty seconds of one-sided ""fight"". Then they would realise that the biggest joke in THE GREAT WHITE HYPE was on them. ","Great White Hype, The",R,1996,1
394," Expectations have been running so high for Frank Darabont's adaptation of the Stephen King serial novel, ""The Green Mile,"" that many film industrialites prematurely labeled it ""The Best Film of 1999,"" even before it was finished filming. 'Premature' is the correct adjective because, while ""The Green Mile"" is a very fine, intimately made drama on its own, it does not come close to standing up to its lofty presumptions. This is not a criticism of the film itself, but simply a negative observation about how hype is more often than not highly unnecessary, and ends up doing more damage than good.  Aside from the 3-hour-plus running time, ""The Green Mile"" occasionally bears a slight resemblance to 1997's ""Titanic,"" particularly in the wraparound story in which we meet a very old man named Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer), who lives at a nursing home and breaks down crying one afternoon when he happens to see Fred Astaire singing ""Cheek to Cheek"" in an old movie. When confidante Elaine (a fabulous Eve Brent) shows her concern and goes to see what is the matter, Paul decides to tell her a story that took place sixty years before, and that he has never discussed until now.  Switch back to the year of 1935 in Louisiana, a much-younger Paul (Tom Hanks) works as a prison guard at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary, where the convicted criminals on death row are sent. Currently suffering a painful bladder infection, but with a lovely, supportive wife (Bonnie Hunt), Paul's whole perspective on life gradually changes with the appearance of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a 7-foot-tall, 350-LB. black man who has been convicted of raping and murdering two young girls. Like a giant kid himself, John instantly does not seem like the type who would hurt a fly, as he even requests that the lights stay on at night, ""'cuz I'm scared of the dark.""  Other inmates are met and also focused on, including Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene), a highly spiritual Native American; William ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), a psychopath as crazy as a crap-house rat; and Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix (Michael Jeter), a kindhearted man who befriends Mr. Jingles, a mouse that roams The Green Mile, called that because the floors are painted green as they lead the inmates to their executions. Complicating matters is the arrival of a new, young prison guard hotshot named Percy (Doug Hutchison), a truly despicable human being who gets his kicks out of humiliating and deliberately hurting others. As time passes, we watch as some of the inmates are taken to their deaths, people that we have grown to care about, and all the while Paul grows a close friendship with John Coffey, who, through supernatural plot developments that will not be divulged here, he becomes convinced is innocent of the crimes which will inevitably send him to his wrongful execution.  Frank Darabont, whose previous film was the similar Stephen King-adapted ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" has returned back to the setting of a prison for the second time in a row, and it cannot be denied that he has a definite flare for this sort of storyline. While ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was that rare case in which it bombed in movie theaters, but gained an overwhelmingly positive following on video, I was not one of its strongest supporters. At close to 2 1/2 hours, the picture was an effective, but severely flawed drama that had (to me) several long, dry stretches in the middle that could have easily been cut out. In comparison, ""The Green Mile"" is over 3 hours in length, but never once overstays its welcome, nor does it even feel like a movie of such great length. This is because, while deliberately paced, it also has been tightly edited by Richard Francis-Bruce, with not one scene that should have been thrown on the cutting room floor; every second of screen time has a clear purpose, even when the developments themselves begin to grow strained by the finale.  One of the most powerful attributes of the film is its depiction of time passing within the penitentiary, as certain intimately drawn characters come and go through death row, just to end up as nothing more than memories within the walls of the building. This subject matter is superbly handled under the helming of writer-director Darabont, as are the occasional sequences of execution by electric chair. Credit must go to Darabont again for not turning his back on these harsh moments, as he graphically depicts the death scenes, which are tough to take not only for what they shows, but also because the victims are people we have grown to like and respect, whether they are guilty or not of their convicted crimes. One particular execution sequence is just about as stirring and devastatingly inhumane as anything I have ever seen on film before.  The ensemble cast of ""The Green Mile"" is first-rate across the board, headlined by star Tom Hanks, whose exact, naturalistic turn as Paul Edgecomb could very well be his most impressive since 1993's ""Philadelphia"" or 1994's ""Forrest Gump."" A perfect balance of personalities and casting, newcomer Michael Clarke Duncan is genuinely effective as the magical, honest John Coffey, all the more striking because it is his feature film debut.   Supporting players all make an impression, no one more so than Michael Jeter, who is outstanding as inmate Del, a terminally lonely but giving person who finds joy in his life through the sort of loyal partnership he forms with Mr. Jingles. Heartbreaking and not easy to forget, Jeter gives one of the strongest supporting performances of the year. As cruel and heartless as a movie character can be without heading in cartoonish territory is Doug Hutchison, as Percy, a man without one redeeming quality who strives on the pain he causes others. While never rising above two dimensions, Hutchison still makes quite an impact. Sam Rockwell, a chameleon who has proven in recent years to be able to play a wide spectrum of characters (1997's ""Box of Moonlight,"" 1998's ""Lawn Dogs""), is downright creepy as William Wharton, a maniac that John Coffey senses is downright evil. The underrated Bonnie Hunt also turns in fine work as Paul's wife, despite not having much to do.   While thoroughly effective and well-made, one major misstep the film takes is in its final fifteen minutes which, at first, abruptly switches gears into more mainstream territory, complete with a climactic scene that feels overly calculated and tough to swallow. This moment is so disappointing because it is purposefully treated to be a scene that gets audiences to cry, rather than one that is more truthful to the situation. Accordingly, when the wraparound story comes back into play in the end, the film takes another turn for the worst. Instead of being merely downbeat, the conclusion is inappropriately depressing and uncalled-for, and left me feeling more revolted than emotionally satisfied. [Side note: Riding home with my brother afterwards, we got into a brief argument spurred from me making a sarcastic comment at him, because the movie had put me in a very bad mood].   The ending may have come as a major letdown, but that, ultimately, cannot take away from the first 165 minutes of ""The Green Mile,"" which are consistently engrossing and perceptive. Darabont is a master of writing and populating his films with memorable, solid supporting characters, and he has struck gold with his cast this time around. It's just too bad, then, that the finale could not have been stronger. It downgrades a potentially great film to being, at most, a very good one. ","Green Mile, The",R,1999,3.5
395,"In Alan J. Pakula's 1982 film ""Sophie's Choice,"" the titlecharacter played by Meryl Streep (in an Oscar-winningperformance) must live down the decision she was forced to makewhile a prisoner of the Nazis.  The Germans, gifted at inventingthe most gruesome games, made her pick which of her two youngchildren will be saved while the other is executed.  Tim BlakeNelson's illustrates another choice in his new movie ""The GreyZone,"" adapted from a 1996 off-off-Broadway play and based on atrue story.  Some Jews were selected to be Sonderkommandos inthe Birkenau death camp in 1944.  The S.S. forces at the campoffered them life for a maximum of four additional months if theywould provide important aid to the Nazis butchers by gaining thetrust of other Jews who were shipped regularly into the camps forimmediate liquidation.  Their role was to keep the machineryrunning smoothly by lying to the new prisoners: telling them tohang their clothes on hooks, to remember the numbers adjacentto their coats, and to walk into the shower to be cleaned beforebeing reunited with their families.  When the JewishSonderkommandos shut the door, the prisoners found that gas,not water, was emitted from the showerheads.  In twenty minutesall were dead.  The Sonderkommandos would then line up thebodies and send them into the ovens.  Theoretically the Germanscould have done the job without help.  In fact, however, the Jewswho volunteered for the detail made the operation run smoothlyand in return the Sonderkommandos were not only spared for upto four months (after which they too were sent to the ovens) butalso received good food, liquor and cigarettes.     What would you have done?  No doubt you could ""answer"" thisexistential question now in the comfort of your home.  What youwould do when literally under the gun, however, is a matter ofspeculation.  According to sources such as a memoir written byDr. Mikos Nyiszli who figures largely in this film, some chosesuicide rather than submit to what they considered an immoralact.  We could only guess that most prisoners offered the choicesold out to their Nazi captors by aiding them in their unearthlytask.     In looking at the ghastly work done each day by theseSonderkommandos, writer-director Tim Blake Nelson (""O"",""Eye ofGod"") is didactic in that he reaches out to his audience as thoughto say, ""I want to educate you about one phase of the Holocaust."" The story is nonetheless a gripping one, not commercial likeSteven Spielberg's marvelous ""Schindler's List"" and while comicslike Steve Buscemi and David Arquette have roles, they are a farcry from Roberto Benigni.  There's no humor in this work, whichevokes the deadly monotony, fear and inhumanity that probablyfigured even larger in real life than in Nelson's script, however cold and bitter the environment that the director creates.  The entirework is filmed by Russell Lee Fine twenty miles from Bulgaria'scapital city of Sofia.       Nelson effectively shows the infighting among theSonderkommandos that makes a near-mockery of thinking thatthey formed ""a Jewish community.""   A major source of disgust byall is the figure of the Hungarian Jewish Dr. Mikos Nyiszli, who notonly survived the war but spent his incarceration living as well ashis captors, even wearing a dark suit and tie as he worked side byside with the notorious Dr. Mengele.  Because of the theatricalnature of the movie, Nelson gives the impression that Nyiszlisimply looked under his microscope, investigation gallstones andthe like much like the Ben Kingsley character doing accountingfor Schindler.  In truth he took part in the most abominablemedical experiments dreamed up by Mengele, who by the way didmake a few breakthroughs in medical science as a result of historture of some Jewish prisoners raised yet another moralquestion of whether these discoveries should be utilized bydoctors today to help their patients.       The daily grind takes on tension as the Hungarian Jews, playedby David Arquette (Hoffman), Daniel Benzali (Schlerner) and SteveBuscemi (Abramowicz) plan a rebellion using powder smuggledinto the camp by women working in a nearby munitions plant. Women are tortured by the Germans, who had heard of theupcoming rebellion and are eager to find the powder.  As somekey women prisoners refuse to talk, the other women are shot oneby one.  The uprising comes by accident rather than by carefulplanning and does succeed in killing a few S.S. officers andblowing up some of the crematoria before being brutally put down. In the one segment that evokes some individuality, a fourteen-year-old girl is found by the Sonderkommandos alive and scarcelybreathing, having miraculously survived the gas chamber. The mendecide to hide her and to try to keep her alive though this couldimperil the rebellion.     The dialogue is the most theatrical aspect of the film.  The Jewsspeak rapidly with clipped sentences, often interrupted inmidstream by others, freely using expletives that make us realizethat the forties for these unfortunate men were no different fromtoday's times except that these people had good reason to usethe four-letter words.  So crisp is the talk that one can't helpbelieving that David Mamet had a hand in fashioning it (which hedid not).  Harvey Keitel comes off best, speaking English with aGerman accent, learned by careful study with a dialect coach: infact the major drawback of the entire work is that everyone elsespeaks American-style English when compelling us to imaginethat they are speaking Hungarian and German.  In one segment,someone speaks English while another corrects him: ""Don't youknow that she doesn't understand Hungarian?""  This could havebeen a great film if Nelson chose Hungarians and Germans for theroles, using English subtitles.     Despite the absurd claims of Holocaust deniers, a great deal isknown about the events of 1941-1945, partly from memoirs of theJews themselves such as that written by Dr. Nyiszli, mostly fromthe obsessive record-keeping of the Nazis.  ""The Grey Zone,"" thetitle representing the ambiguous morality of theSonderkommandos, takes its place proudly among the plethora ofHolocaust films, a valuable addition because of its originality, itslack of sentimentality, its refusal to become slick andcommercial.  We see these Jews as doing what most of us wouldhave done under the same circumstances, not heroic even whencarrying out the rebellion which is borne of desperation rather thanhope.  In that sense they are not like the brave men aboard theUnited Airlines play that was diverted last year from a primeterrorist target, who may have saved the White House fromdestruction by giving up their lives.  The Sonderkommandos weresimply not going to go gentle into that dark night but must haverealized from the beginning that their plan would be onlymoderately successful, that nothing of importance would besaved. ","Grey Zone, The",R,2002,2.5

""I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork.""Going back to your tenth high school reunion is hard, particularly forthose with difficult-to-explain professions.       Poor Martin tries the truth on the people, but they will not takehim seriously.  ""I'm a professional killer,"" he tells David, hisex-classmate and now real estate salesmen.  ""Do you have to dopost-graduate work for that?"" asks David.  When Mr. Newberry, hisex-girlfriend's dad, asks ""What have you been doing with yourself?"" heretorts, ""Uh, professional killer.""  Beaming, the dad compliments him,""Good for you -- growth industry.""       After a while Martin gives up and starts inventing occupations.When a soused ex-classmate named Amy (his sister Ann Cusack) asks himthe canonical, ""What do you do?"", he flippantly tells her, ""I work atKentucky Fried Chicken.  I sell biscuits all over the Southlands.""       As you can see, the strength of the new film GROSSE POINTE BLANKlies in its intelligent and funny script by John Cusack and TomJankiewicz, which they based on a story by Jankiewicz.  Equally good isthe casting, the acting, and the directing.  Director George Armitage,who last did the excellent, but underappreciated, MIAMI BLUES, brings aperfect sense of comedic timing and an ability to orchestrate actionsequences perfectly to blend in with the humor.  The ending montage,for example, is pure spaghetti Western, but Armitage's approach isfresh and funny.  Although the film has a surfeit of cartoonishviolence, it remains good spirited and charming throughout.       John Cusack sets the comedic pace for the film by approaching hisposition of hired gun with total sincerity.  Complementing him is hissecretary Marcella, played by his sister Joan Cusack.  Marcella, whostays on the phone in most of her scenes, alternates between orderingmajor weapons caches and giving culinary advice.  She is the one whoencourages Martin to go to his reunion although she warns him thateveryone looked ""swelled"" at hers.       A great subplot has a rival killer named Grocer (Dan Aykroyd)trying to get Martin to join an assassins' union, which Martin rejectsbecause he hates meetings.  (Don't we all.)  The casting of Aykroyd asa paid killer is so unlikely that it ends up being a perfect choice.       In a scene that starts off like the bar scene in STAR WARS, therival murderers go with hidden guns into a coffee shop.  ""Whoa ChattyCathy!"" Grocer tells Martin as Martin starts to talk.  ""Clip yourstring.""       The scene quickly changes to a homage to the classic scene fromFIVE EASY PIECES.  ""What do you want in your omelet?""  the incessantlyperky waitress demands.  ""Nothing,"" replies a tense Martin.  ""Well,that's not technically an omelet,"" corrects the waitress.       The film bursts at the seams with great minor characters,including the security guard with not much upstairs who scares thepeople he is hired to protect and the drunk car dealer who sounds likemister tough guy but is actually a poetry-reciting Pillsbury Dough Boylook-alike.  The oddest choice is Alan Arkin as a doctor named Oatmanwho is Martin's reluctant therapist.  (""Don't kill anybody for a fewdays,"" advises the doctor.  ""See what it feels like.""  Martin assureshim, ""I'll give it a shot.""  But the doctor corrects him, ""No, don'tshoot anybody."")       I have left out one of my favorite actresses, Minnie Driver, whoplays  Debi Newberry, the high school flame whom Martin stood up tenyears ago for the prom.  They rekindle their romance in the film, andit almost works, but gets lost in the direction.  Armitage can notdecide if he wants to go for the romantic angle or the comedic with theresult that neither is fully satisfying.  He should have approached itwith complete earnestness as he did the whole assassin part.       There is only one part of the story where our hero Martin isfrightened, the reunion.  The people at it are so weird that he becomesthe sanest person there.  As someone who has been to all of my highschool reunions, I can vouch for the fact that some strange people doshow up.  One of my favorite films, SOMETHING WILD, also deals with thehigh school reunion venue.   (At the Grosse Pointe reunion, one couldquibble with hairdos from 60s and 70s being on women who went to highschool in the mid-80s, but in the context of a reunion spoof it wasfunny.)       A film with several big laughs, but my best time was with all ofthe inventive, smaller snippets of dialog.  An unapologetically funnyfilm that was happy to have no message other than laughter and nointention other than making a well deserved profit -- just like Martin.(""You're a psychopath,"" said Debi.  ""No, psychopaths do it for noreason,"" said Martin.  ""I do it for money."") ",Grosse Pointe Blank,R,1997,2
397,"At first glance, GROUNDHOG DAY looks like a film thatepitomises the worst in today's Hollywood - the lack oforiginality and total reliance on ""high concept"". The plotis ""borrowed"" from a short SF story by Richard A. Lupoff,then turned into TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, short film byJonathan Heap and, finally, passable but forgettable TVthriller by Jack Sholder. But this 1993 comedy, directed by noted SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE comedian Harold Ramis isactually something very rare in today's Hollywood - a filmthat is in the same time very funny and very humane,thought-provoking yet entertaining. Because of that theauthors of GROUNDHOG DAY should be forgiven for their use ofnot so original idea.  The film begins in Pittsburgh television station, whereweatherman Phil Conners (played by Bill Murray) receives yetanother routine and boring assignment - he must go to smalltown of Punxsutawney and cover Groundhog Day, thetraditional event where a local mascot, groundhog namedPhil, indicates the length of remaining winter day. Conners,self- centred misanthropic, is so disgusted with the taskthat he decides to make life miserable for his producer Rita(played by Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (ChrisElliott). To make things even worse for him, the unexpectedblizzard grounds the crew in the small town. When he wakesup the next day, he suddenly realises that the people aresaying the same lines, using the same gestures and that thesame events are happening all over again. He is stuck in thetime loop and he is forced to relive Groundhog Day again andagain for, its seems, all eternity. Stuck in somethingresembling personal hell, Phil must find a way to adapt tothe new situation.  Supernatural comedy as a sub-genre more often than notproduced weak, mediocre and formulaic movies in modernHollywood. Humour in such comedies was lame, storylinescliched and predictable, and it usually degenerated intoself-serving special effects bonanza. But, it wasn't thecase with the GROUNDHOG DAY, mostly because the movie hademployed the talents already experienced in such areas. Thedirector and co-screenwriter Harold Ramis had already provedhimself by writing a screenplay for GHOSTBUSTERS, a similar,although more spectacular product of that genre. For thisfilm, he was joined by Danny Rubin and the result was veryintelligent and tight script. The best thing two of them didwas to get rid of any scientific, para-scientific or magicalexplanations for the personal time warp - which wouldprobably look corny and unconvincing. Instead theyconcentrated on the practical matters and explored the waysan average man like Phil would cope with the situation. Andit was done superbly. Movie that covers the same situationsand dialogues over and over again was in great danger ofbeing repetitive. But the script prevented this - afterbeing introduced to the main storyline in first, ""normal"",segment, we see how even the smallest of details couldbranch a whole new and interesting chain of events.  What makes this film especially funny is the great talent ofBill Murray, one of the best comedians in modern Hollywood.The entire movie rested on his shoulders. While all otheractors had rather simple roles to repeat, his character wasthe only one being the aware the utter repetitiveness of hisexistence and thus the only one who was changing through theentire movie. It was really fine to see the different wayshe reacted to the situation - anger, disbelief, despair andfinal acceptance - all that through the subtle gestures orone-liners. What makes his character even more humane andlikeable, despite his more than obvious flaws, is a factthat the he is faced with perpetual dilemmas and that hetakes different courses of actions, many of them the sameones some of us would take in his place. And, finally, wesee him change and change for the better, which, of coursewould reward both him and the audience with a happy ending.  The other actors and their performances were, as someoneshould expect, shadowed by Bill Murray's role and reduced tobit parts. Andie MacDowell as his attractive producer Ritawas, of course, good in her role, but the chemistry betweenMurray and her wasn't particularly engaging, making theirromantic subplot somewhat too formulaic. And the editing inthis very well directed film should have been better -Phil's mood change from manic to suicidal seems a little bittoo sudden. But, despite those minor flaws, GROUNDHOG DAYdeserved its reputation of a surprisingly good film,reputation that gives it a serious potential to be regardedas 1990s classic by future filmophiles. ",Groundhog Day,PG,1993,3

This seems likeone of the adages taught by Confucius or Lao-Tze, or maybe evenone of the those Indian gurus former waiters, perhaps, who comeover to the States to make their fortune by convincing us that theEast has all the answers to the problems of the West.  This maynot be the philosophy held dear by President Bush but there areenough rich people in America who are about to become a lotricher thanks to the president's tax cut who are, despiteeverything, unhappy.  If spending money on furs and diamondsdoes not bring a big smile, why not hand your money over to anexotic guy with a turban?        What inspires Ramu (Jimi Mistry), the titled guru of Universal'srollicking sex comedy, is not at first the astonishing wealth thatsome fortune-cookie dealers like the Maharishi Mahesh Yogiaccumulated by preying on the fashionably discontent.  After all,his aim from the start is to leave his native Delhi and come overhere to become a movie actor.  (Why he chose to settle in NewYork rather than the left coast is another story, but there's enoughof a story crammed into this plot to distract us from that and allother logical concerns.)      Daisy von Scherler Mayer opens Tracey Jackson's story on ayoung boy watching one of the interminable Bollywoodproductions, inhabiting the only seat in a theater of broadlysmiling faces to be dismayed the lad's squirming.

Winding up in a New York porn productiondirected by Dwain (Michael McKean who was off-the-wall hilariousin Christopher Guest's ""Best in Show""), he is (so to speak) unableto work hard enough, is tutored by his would-be co-star Sharrona(Heather Graham), and steals the sexual secrets she reveals toput the sex in spirituality for New York's passion-challengedsociety people, particularly the trendy but unfocused Lexi (MarisaTomei).     ""The Guru"" both plays homage to and sends up the terminallyopulent movies churned out by Bombay, movies that seem asdesigned to take the average Indian out of his dreary, poverty-stricken world as the glitzy American Depression movies of thethirties served for us.  More important, though, ""The Guru"" mocksnot simply the trust that trendy Americans to this day put in so-called spiritualists from anywhere but the States but America'snaively optimistic belief that somewhere Out There is The Answerto our unhappy condition whether that be found withpsychotherapists, fortune tellers, astrologers, or trips to Vegasand Disneyland.       ""The Guru"" finds its genre not far from the more or lessadolescent vulgar productions from the Farrelly Brothers' ""There'sSomething About Mary,"" Paul Weitz's ""American Pie,"" ToddPhillips' ""Road Trip"" and most recently director Phillips' ""OldSchool.""  The obligatory nude scene finds all the members ofLexi's circle sitting down to dinner in the birthday suits, newlyliberated and clothed only with expressions such as ""God wantsus to have sex.""

400,"""A Guy Thing,"" directed by Chris Koch (2000's ""Snow Day""), benefitsfrom being released only one week after ""Just Married."" Both filmsare romantic comedies targeting the teen and twentysomething demographic,but the difference in quality is telling when they are placed sideby side. While much of the humor in ""Just Married"" seemed tired andfell flat, and the meanspirited script made way for a central relationshipnot worth caring about, ""A Guy Thing"" flows more smoothly on all counts. The screenplay, extraneously credited to four writers (Greg Glienna,Pete Schwaba, Matt Tarses, and Bill Wrubel), is an admittedly unoriginalone that has recycled many ideas from other movies, but its screwballcomedy sensibilities fetchingly pay off more often than not. The proceedingsare aided immeasurably by a game cast of bright faces, with JasonLee (2002's ""Stealing Harvard""), Julia Stiles (2001's ""O""), and SelmaBlair (2002's ""The Sweetest Thing"") charismatically leading the way. ""A Guy Thing,"" which acquires its name from one of the more unlikelygood running jokes in the piece, opens at the bachelor party of niceguy Paul Morse (Jason Lee), who is to marry the organized and well-to-doKaren (Selma Blair) in less than a week. After having a few too manydrinks, Paul wakes up the next morning in bed beside Becky (JuliaStiles), one of the Tiki girls hired to entertain the night before.Paul has no recollection of what happened, while Becky assures himthat they merely slept next to each other. As the countdown to thewedding continues, Paul finds himself spiraling down a road of lies,not helped by the revelation that Becky is Karen's cousin and Maidof Honor. And worst of all, Paul starts to find the freespirited nature Becky holds as a more attractive option than his pre-planned life of normalcy with Karen. A lightweight, but undeniable, entertainment, ""A Guy Thing"" worksmore successfully as a comedy than a romance, if only because moretime is attributed to the former. A few scenes are gems in the waythey are performed and edited for maximum comic effect, includingan episode in which Paul fakes bowel troubles in order to avoid comingin contact with Becky, and another dealing with Paul's horrific discoverythat he has contacted crabs while in a business meeting with his soon-to-befather-in-law (James Brolin). Meanwhile, the potential romance thatblossoms between Paul and Becky works because they are both wonderfullylikable and intelligent individuals, but not enough time is spentdeveloping the relationship for the predictable climax to have thedesired satisfying payoff. The actors are easily the picture's highlight, most of which wouldbe fun to watch even if they were simply reading the phone book. Followingup his lead role in the throwaway ""Stealing Harvard,"" Jason Lee hasbetter writing and flashier chances to show off his comedic abilitieshere, even if the part of Paul isn't significantly different. JuliaStiles, never known to give a weak performance, is luminous as theslightly wild and always charming Becky. While Stiles isn't onscreennearly as much as you might expect, when she is she steals the showand makes it instantly easy to see why Paul would be smitten withher. In the somewhat thankless part of fiancee Karen, Selma Blairis blessed by the kind of smart writing that avoids turning her intoa bitchy caricature and, instead, chooses to present her as a sympatheticpresence. In supporting roles, Shawn Hatosy (2002's ""John Q""), asPaul's best friend Jim, and the always-reliable but lately underusedJulie Hagerty (2001's ""Fred! dy Got Fingered""), as Paul's mom, are most memorable. Had Paul and Becky's relationship been given a few extra scenes, hiseventual choice in being with the person that will make him happiest(Becky) over the person who is safer (Karen) would have had a morestimulating effect. Still, ""A Guy Thing"" is a charmer when it wantsto be, if only because the characters on display are ones we enjoyspending time with. They are infinitely more mature, and their escapadesgenuinely funnier and heartfelt, than anything that is offered in ""Just Married."" ","Guy Thing, A",PG-13,2003,2.5

HACKERSmakes you leave the theater angry at everyone associated with the showfor stealing your money and your time with a movie that insults theaudience's intelligence with complete garbage.  HACKERS was directed byIain Softley and produced by Michael Peyser, Ralph Winter, and JanetGraham.  I would suggest writing these names down and avoiding anythingthey are ever associated with.  HACKERS is a an MTV style movie thatburst your ear drums with loud rock music and attempts to dazzle youreyes with flashing images and machine gun style cuts by cinematographerAndrzej Sekula.       The movie starts off with a SWAT team the size of a small armybreaking down the door of a modest suburban home with a battering ram.The police army does not announce its presence since they have to sneakup on a grade school hacker about 4 feet tall.  We then switch rapidlyto a scene where he is being sentence by a stern judge to never use ""acomputer or a touch tone telephone"" until he is an adult.  Seems he hascrashed all of Wall Street and hundreds of other places.  Sure.       Next we get to see our hero, Dade known by the handle of CrashOverride (Jonny Lee Miller), in high school.  He is older now, but heis still hacking on those computers regardless of what the judge said.His mom is played as an absolute idiot.  She yells at him and appearsoblivious to what he is doing in his room.  In one of the many tritelines by first time and lets us hope last time screenwriter RafaelMoreu, his mom tells Dade she wants him to ""stop playing with thecomputer and start playing with girls.""       Well at school, Crash Override does meet a strange girl named Katewhose handle is Acid Burn (Angelina Jolie), but their relationship isnot exactly the traditional boy/girl thing.  Acid Burn starts off therelationship by tricking him to get locked out on the roof in arainstorm.  Later, Crash Override reprograms all of the sprinklersystems in the building to come on and get everyone else wet.  Whatwonderful teenagers these kids are.       The costumes by Roger Burton are particularly ridiculous.  CrashOverride always hacks on his computer with black color sun glasses on,and the room is usually light.  Try looking at a computer screensomeday with black glasses on and see what you can see.       I have liked some of the hacker movies.  I thought THE NET wasfairly good and WAR GAMES was great.  But here, the technical advisor(Nick Jarecki) was AWOL.  In the first series of scenes as we see CrashOverride hacking away, he types continually, but all that is on thescreens is four columns of blurry images, not text, moving in oppositedirections of each other.  Frequently his screen flashes images of oldmovies one after another while he is programming.  In one scene, hetakes control of a television station through an implausible scenario.Next he has to wrestle with another hacker who is hacking him forcontrol of the robotic video tape machine that directs what the TVstation is showing its audience.  Right.       When Crash Override sees people, his mind sees the old movies thatare always flashing on his computer screen.  Do you have the problemthat old movies flash on your screen a lot while you are programming?So do I, and tiny green men frequently run of my floppy drive and danceon my keyboard as well.       One of the ""stars"" of the show is Cereal Killer (Matthew Lillard).Let me not describe him other than to give you his first line.  Moreuhas him say to Crash Override, ""All great artists have asphyxiated ontheir own vomit."" One of the other hackers declares in another scenethat ""I need to get a handle.  If I don't, I don't have an identity.""       HACKERS runs on forever at 1:45.  It is rated PG-13, but trust meyou do not want your kids to pollute their minds by seeing this drivel.I hated this show so much it took me several hours to calm down afterseeing it.  I have always had a consistent rating system that goes fromzero to four stars, and I rarely give out the rating on either end ofthe scale.  For this movie, I seriously considered giving it a minusone, but for consistency I will most generously award it zero stars. ",Hackers,PG-13,1995,1

A movie that should have gone directly to video, it is beingreleased theatrically as counter programming to the HARRY POTTER onslaught. Most of the action takes place on a dark and stormy night on ""NewAlcatraz,"" where Sascha and his fellow prisoners are incarcerated. An infamous prisoner is about to be executed.  In one of the mostpreposterous plot points in recent memory, the movie has the SupremeCourt Justice who had sentenced the criminal stopping by to have afew last words with him and to watch his execution.  This is all doneunder incredibly tight security, which, of course, isn't tight enough. When all hell breaks loose, Sascha leads a rag-tag group of convictsto fight the well-armed baddies who have stormed the island.  Castagainst type, Morris Chestnut plays the chief villain.  Hopefully,he'll stick to romantic comedies in the future.   Although the movie is very loud and the guns are very big, the movieis slackly paced with more fat than you'd find in a Weight Watchers'session.

Thesame goes for ""Halloween: Resurrection,"" the eighth chapter in thehorror saga, even if it is, unfortunately, at the bottom rung of the series' entries.  After a provocative prologue in which Jamie Lee Curtis (1978's ""Halloween,""1981's ""Halloween II,"" and 1998's ""Halloween: H20"") reprises her tragicrole of Laurie Strode and, in the process, finally concludes the arcof her eternally suffering character, the main story gets underway.At Haddonfield University College, six graduate students have beenchosen by cable show entrepreneur Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) toact as the subjects of a live Halloween Internet webcast set insidethe childhood home of serial killer Michael Myers (Brad Loree). Whatthe college kids do not plan on is the surprise appearance of Michaelhimself, who apparently is not amused by trespassers on his property. From beginning to end, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is a strictly hit-or-missaffair. While director Rick Rosenthal (who also helmed ""HalloweenII"" over twenty years ago) injects a certain slickness and energyto the proceedings, his expertise as a filmmaker seems to have regressed,rather than flourished, with the passing years. Rosenthal misguidedlydoes not trust the intelligence of his viewers, convinced that spellingeverything out rather than going for subtlety and veritable suspenseis the correct way to go. He has also disregarded the occasional onscreentitle cards that have been one of the distinguishing postmarks ofevery ""Halloween"" film up until now. Their disappearance in this installmentmay seem like a minor point, but it lessens the general atmosphereand feeling of the holiday. Also missing from ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is a solid screenplayor any strong heroes or heroines that we can identify with and rootfor. Written by Larry Brand and Sean Hood, the movie too often devolvesinto a stream of throwaway pop-culture references (from ""The Osbournes""to ""Survivor"") that will be out-of-date in just a few years. Brandand Hood also have trouble finding the humanity in a line of one-notecharacters who are little more than obligatory chopping blocks forthe unstoppable Michael Myers. The lead potential victim, taking over the reigns for Laurie Strode,is Psych major Sara Moyer. Not only is she never even remotely fleshedout as a fully sympathetic figure, but actress Bianca Kajlich (2000's""Bring It On"") is no Jamie Lee Curtis. If Kajlich is a thoroughlyuncharismatic heroine, Busta Rhymes (2000's ""Shaft""), as motormouthFreddie Harris, overacts to such a degree that his every appearance(of which there is many) is worth nothing but a loud groan from anyserious-minded fan of the series. Showing a bit more promise, consideringwhat she had to work with, is Katee Sackhoff (2001's ""My First Mister""),as Sara's best friend, Jenna, who dreams of a career in the Hollywoodspotlight. Sackhoff is energetic and fun in a way that Kajlich never is. Lest it seem like ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is a complete washout,the film does come through in some vital departments. While the ""Halloween""theme music is not played as much as it should have been, its reinterpretationand the new music score (by Danny Lux) is creepy and appropriatelyoff-kilter. Brad Loree, as Michael Myers, has perfected the movementsand actions of the original Shape in a way that no other actor hasdone since 1978. The reality-show webcams are effectively intercutwith a conventional film style that adds an extra layer to the storytellingand must have been a creative nightmare to pull off. Finally, thelast half-hour is tautly paced and exciting enough to become a trulyinvolving and visceral experience. If the movie is never particularlyscary, due to the replacement of gore over tightly wound tension,it does manage to thrill once it gets going. Predictably, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" concludes with a ""surprise""ending that leaves the door open for another sequel. One hopes, however,that before ""Halloween 9"" is given a greenlight, executive producerMoustapha Akkad realizes what made 1978's ""Halloween"" such an unforgettableand groundbreaking experience. A reliance on true-to-life charactersin true-to-life settings put face-to-face with pure evil, and carriedout with carefully handled suspense, tight editing, and originality.As much fun as it is to see a person's decapitated head roll aroundin the washer and another's skull crushed to a bloody pulp, leavethat sort of gory behavior to Jason Vorhees in the low-rent ""Fridaythe 13th"" series. I, for one, hope to never see such things againin a motion picture involving Michael Myers. With such a respectablepedigree, this series really does deserve better than what ""Halloween:Resurrection"" ultimately has to offer.",Halloween: Resurrection,R,2002,2
405,"The Uber Hamlet has hit the big screen. Kenneth Branagh's four hour production of Shakespeare's classic, the first full-text version ever filmed, is the King Kong of tragedies. As a play, Hamlet deals with everything: murder, passion, politics, betrayal, madness, love, death, and the very meaning of existence. Branagh tackles it all with a vengeance; he's not only going to illuminate every facet of Shakespeare's epic, he's going to do it in such a vigorous, grand fashion that contemporary audiences will embrace the often difficult work. His vision and chutzpah is boundless and the film virtually bursts with energy. There are many magnificent moments in Hamlet, and quite a few painful ones.  Filmed in wide screen 70mm, the movie was made on massive sets in London. For the exterior shots the handsome Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire stands in for Elsinore. Visually, the interior scenes are a feast, brimming with rich details and spacious beauty. The outdoor scenes are a mixed bag. Some shots, particularly those of advancing troops, have a real sense of grandeur. Unfortunately, many scenes are undermined by surprisingly bad set dressings (check out the tons of fake snow) and chintzy special effects. A nighttime shot early in the film attempts to capture an ominous, spooky feel, but the overuse of dry ice, coupled with very cheesy shots of the earth cracking open, make the whole scene look more like an amateur haunted house.  But enough about the dressings, let's look at the performances. Branagh states ""This production is cast color-blind, nationality-blind, accent-blind. I wanted to work with people I had admired for a number of years and who I thought would be very good for the parts."" Some of his choices are inspired. Despite a spiky blond hairdo and look reminiscent of the royalty in David Lynch's ""Dune,"" Derek Jacobi is magnificent as Claudius, Hamlet's murderous uncle. Jacobi's performance captures the treachery of the man, but also his fear, guilt and remorse. Without minimizing the evil of Claudius' deeds, Jacobi makes him much more of a human being.   Nicholas Farrell gives a hearty, utterly credible performance as Horatio, and Kate Winslet's turn as Ophelia is both lovely and heartbreaking. Charlton Heston is a commanding presence as the Player King, a part often minimized in other productions of the play, and Billy Crystal does a surprisingly good job as a wry gravedigger.   Alas, some of the other actors don't fare as well. Julie Christie, as Queen Gertrude, is passive, displaying little of the character's depth. As the devoted Marcellus, Jack Lemmon delivers his lines in a shaky, tentative fashion. He's hard to watch. And Robin Williams, playing the boorish Osric, seems cartoonish and wildly out of step.  As Hamlet, Branagh's performance is all over the place. In some scenes, notably the ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy, he is sublime, adding new layers to Shakespeare's extraordinary dialogue. But all too often, in his zeal to portray Hamlet as a vital, robust man, he leaps about exsessively, shouting his lines at breakneck speed in bombastic fashion. In most versions of the play, one of the enduring mysteries is whether Hamlet simply feigns madness or actually crosses the line into insanity. Not so here _ Branagh does everything but wink at the audience, leaving little doubt about the mentality beneath the Dane's behavior.  During the intermission, which divides the film's 158 minute first portion from the 84 minute conclusion, I confessed to my companions that much of the archaic dialogue, delivered at lightning fast speed, was flying way over my head. My friends laughed and said they both feared they were the only people in the theater that felt that way. Despite Branagh's noble intentions, the rushed, often hard to understand dialogue makes it clear why the play is usually cut.   The second portion of Hamlet, structurally shaky even in the short form, is particularly confusing and inconsistent here, though it does wraps up with a spectacular, if stagy, sword fight. Despite its problems, Branagh's Hamlet is well worth your time. His reach extends his grasp and the film stumbles along the way, but Branagh's audacious vision, coupled with Shakespeare's dazzling prose, delivers many substantial rewards.  ",Hamlet,PG-13,1996,3
406,"  ""Meg Ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood!,"" screams the television ads for ""Hanging Up,"" disastrously written by real-life sisters Delia and Nora Ephron and sloppily directed by Diane Keaton. Make me laugh again! Not only is ""Hanging Up"" misadvertised, since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister Meg Ryan and gives her two co-stars, Lisa Kudrow and Diane Keaton, little more than extended cameos, but they don't actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes. And we are supposed to believe their strong bond, and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship, despite them being apart for the majority of the running time? Excuse me, again, while I almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion.   Eve Marks (Meg Ryan) is the middle Mozzell sister, still living in the California town where she grew up, and with a husband (Adam Arkin) and pre-teen son (Jesse James). Her elderly, wisecracking father, Lou (Walter Matthau, in his brightest performance in years) has just recently been put into the hospital, in the final stages of what I assume is Alzheimer's (even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him). While Eve's relationship with her mother (Cloris Leachman) is nearly nonexistent, since she ran out on Lou and her children years ago, she has had her fair share of up's and down's with Lou, who used to be an alcoholic. Her older sister is Georgia (Diane Keaton), an editor for the self-titled magazine, ""Georgia,"" while Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) is the youngest, a soap opera actress. Interestingly, their professions are given, but we not once ever see them working at their jobs, or, for that matter, learn much of anything about them. Maddy, Georgia, and Eve do not see each other much anymore, their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart, but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another. And they talk. And talk. And talk...   In fact, the telephone is the major star of the film, even more so than Ryan, as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long. If you are able to get through the opening half-hour, in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them, you will surely survive the rest. The question is, who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating, self-involved pat-on-the-back?   How could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow, and Diane Keaton be so very bad in so many different ways? Issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up, but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner, and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood, it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought. Also, it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another, but no dynamic metamorphosizes. And when they do reunite in the finale, their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children. You can see the impending death coming a mile away, and it conveniently occurs in the next scene, so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves, and with each other. You think to yourself: ""The only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight,"" and like clockwork, it also occurs by the end credits.   Meg Ryan is a versatile actress (look no further than 1998's ""Hurlyburly"" or 1994's ""When a Man Loves a Woman""), despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies. With ""Hanging Up,"" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with Nora Ephron, a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in Hollywood again after this big-budget, high-profile debacle. Even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department, she nonetheless is very good, and the two scenes that work, flashbacks to Christmas 1988, when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother, and to Halloween 1993, when Lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken stupor, are effective because of the realism Ryan brings to the situations.  Diane Keaton, as Georgia, is better as an actress than a director here, but that is a wildly feeble compliment. What is more than a little far-fetched is that Keaton is distinctly older than Ryan and Kudrow, although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children, she is no more than five years Ryan's senior. Yeah, right.   Lastly, poor Lisa Kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture, after her even more thin role in 1999's ""Analyze This."" Kudrow isn't given enough time to create a full personality with Maddy, so it isn't her fault she doesn't register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue. If anything, though, Kudrow is a real talent, and I anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time, as in her brilliantly nuanced, Oscar-caliber work in 1998's ""The Opposite of Sex."" If you are a fan of Kudrow's (and who isn't?), do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to Kudrow in sixty seconds than ""Hanging Up"" does in its entirety.   As Eve's hardworking husband, Adam Arkin is, predictably, squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do, until a subplot reveals itself midway through, only to never be mentioned again. Cloris Leachman, as with Ryan and Matthau, makes a small, but noticeable impression with her, albeit, very brief appearance, while Edie McClurg, as a rosy-cheeked woman Lou had an affair with in the Christmas 1988 flashback, manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production.   Nearly all the emotions displayed within ""Hanging Up"" are patently manufactured, and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters, aside from Eve, why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats? If, for some bizarre, ""Twilight Zone""-type of reason, you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film, my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over. Saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions. ",Hanging Up,PG-13,2000,1
407," Despite becoming more commercial over the years, the SundanceFilm Festival still manages to showcase some of the best of Americanindependent cinema and unearth a few new talented directors.  HappyTexas was one of the surprise hits of the 1999 festival, and inspireda bidding war amongst some of the studios.  This delightfully off beat comedy is the first film fromwriter Ed Stone and director Mark Illsley, who crafted his skills asan assistant with Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, RapaNui, etc).  Happy Texas tells the story of two escaped convicts whohide out in a small town in Texas, and are mistaken for a pair of gaypageant directors hired to prepare the local school girls for aforthcoming beauty quest.  While the wonderfully named, barely literate car thief WayneWayne Wayne jr (Steve Zahn, from Out Of Sight, Bandwagon, etc) is leftwith eager teacher Ms Schaefer (Illeana Douglas) to help hone thetalents of his young charges, the more suave Harry Sawyer (JeremyNortham, largely cast against type) checks out the local bank, whichhe judges is ripe for the picking.  But Harry slowly falls in love with the beautiful bank manager(Profiler's Ally Walker), unaware that Chappy (William H Macy), thetown's lonely and closeted sheriff, has also secretly fallen for him -hard.  Further complications develop when another escaped convictshows up and forces Harry and Wayne to help him rob the bank.  Happy Texas follows on from those other recent comedies (In &Out, The Birdcage, Three To Tango, etc) that embrace complex issues ofmale sexuality and identity and milk the possibilities of the scenariofor laughs.  This charming and deftly written comedy also moves intomore familiar territory when it takes a non-judgmental look at themores and attitudes of small town America.  This is a town thatwelcomes a pair of gay pageant directors with open arms because theyare strangers passing through, but somehow forces the sheriff toconceal his sexuality because he has to live and work with thesepeople.  Happy Texas draws much of its genial humour from its look atlife in this small town and its quirky inhabitants, although there isnothing malicious in it.  Unfortunately this zesty and fast paced film seems to run outof puff before the final reel.  The film is let down slightly only bythe somewhat conventional nature of its very busy finale, whichincludes a chase and a shoot-out.  Illsley manages to strike a nicebalance between the slapstick and the poignant here, and he directswith surprising restraint, given his limited experience.  The solid cast throw themselves into their roles withenthusiasm, but the film is lifted somewhat by two standoutperformances.  The busy but always reliable Macy brings a nice touchof pathos to his wonderful performance as Chappy, the lovelornsheriff.  Zahn is superb and brings a nice manic energy and physicalquality to his boisterous role.  During the hectic film going holiday season you should make adetour via the multiplexes to check out Happy Texas.  It will put asmile on your face. ",Happy Texas,PG-13,1999,3
408,"Some people have misfortune to discover some facts about lifethey didn't want to know. One of them is protagonist of HARDTRUTH, 1994 thriller directed by Kristine Peterson. Jonah Mantz(played by Michael Rooker) is a policeman who has spent the bestyears of his life trying to save the public from the street scum. Yetafter the years of pain and sacrifice Mantz has realised that hisefforts would remain unappreciated and that he would spend hisold age as a poor man. Hamilton Nichols (played by Ray Baker) isa city official who had adopted somewhat more pragmatic view ofthe public service and the results of such practice are stashed inhis safe. Nichols' secretary Lisa Kantrell (played by LysetteAnthony) happens to be Mantz's girlfriend and the policemanwould use this in order to steal that money. Unfortunately, his planrequires extra hand so he hires Chandler Etheridge (played byEric Roberts), electronics expert and part-time burglar. ButEtheridge soon shows that he is interested in something more thanhis share of the loot.  Among many low budget thrillers that used to be made in mid1990s, THE HARD TRUTH stands out because of its faithfulnesstowards film noir principles. The tone of the film is pessimistic, theatmosphere is dark and the ending is rather unpredictable, atleast compared with the average example of this genre. Yet thebiggest asset of this film is Michael Rooker, character actor whowas very good choice for the role of disillusioned and world-wearyprotagonist. On the other hand, hard look of the film iscompromised with the overuse of erotic scenes that are oftendistracting and give THE HARD TRUTH unmistakable taste ofexploitation cinema. Yet, even with this flaw taken intoconsideration, Kristine Peterson's direction and Jonathan Tydor'smake this film much better than its title would indicate. ","Hard Truth, The",R,1994,2
409,"""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is low-brow, profane, and undeniablyirrelevant, but any comedy that finds a way to sneak in obscure jokesabout Katie Holmes' nude scene in 2000's ""The Gift"" and the infectiousbeats of Wilson Phillips' 1990 pop hit, ""Hold On,"" is far from stupid.This comes all the more as a surprise because of its superficial similaritiesto director Danny Leiner's last film, ""Dude, Where's My Car?,"" whichwas likewise about two stoner friends on the search for something.That 2000 effort was more frequently moronic than funny, and its incessantlynonsensical, thoroughly dull subplot about aliens in the second halfsunk whatever charm it might have otherwise had. By comparison, ""Haroldand Kumar Go to White Castle"" also veers all over the map, a seriesof sketches more than a tightly strewn plot, but its raunchy R-ratedsource o f comedy is of a richer and more fearless variety, and itstwo lead characters based squarely within the plains of reality. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are 22-year-old best friendsjust out of college trying to make it in the dreaded ""real world.""While Harold is a responsible investment banker, he is utterly boredby his job and used as an easy scapegoat so the rest of his coworkerscan slack off. Kumar, meanwhile, has a chance to study at a top medicalschool, but his half-hearted efforts are little more than a meansto satisfying his doctor father. With the weekend upon them, the uptightHarold and randy Kumar get together, smoke a bowl, and find themselveswith a mouth-watering craving for White Castle hamburgers. With noWhite Castle in their New Jersey town, the twosome innocently headoff into the night to reach the closest one in Cherry Hill. Theirjourney, to put it mildly, ends up becoming far more arduous and adventure-filledthan either could have expected. At first glance, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" appears tobe a dim-witted, trite waste of film stock, something of a distaff""Cheech and Chong"" remake, but first-time screenwriters Jon Hurwitzand Hayden Schlossberg cheerfully skewer expectations. When the palsfind themselves stuck in a bathroom stall surrounded on both sidesby young women with explosive bowel movements, the film puts its ownfresh spin on a desperate, time-worn gag that was last seen in ""WhiteChicks."" When Harold and Kumar hitch a ride with a scary tow-truckdriver littered with puss-filled boils on his face and are taken backto his house, the sexually comic outcome defies the predictable normof such a situation. And when the pair pick up former ""Doogie Howser""star Neil Patrick Harris (having grand fun at playing himself), trippingon Ecstasy and horny as all get-up, the way in which director DannyLeiner handles this kooky plot turn borders on virtuoso. Throw inan escaped cheetah who gets high and takes Harold and Kumar for areckless ride on its back; a delirious dream sequence that replacesa human wife for Kumar with a super-sized bag of weed; and a wrongfullyimprisoned, brainy black man (Gary Anthony Williams) who has cometo terms with his fate as a constant victim of racism, and what onehas at the end is a thin little comedy that is funnier and more savvy than most. In a gimmick that pays off, two bright actors usually stuck playingstereotypical supporting parts„Korean-American John Cho (best knownas the ""MILF"" guy from 1999's ""American Pie,"" 2001's ""American Pie2,"" and 2003's ""American Wedding"") and Indian-American Kal Penn (bestknown as Ryan Reynold's foreign exchange student sidekick in 2002's""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"")„have taken over the lead roles ofHarold and Kumar. Cho and Penn are a venerably offbeat team, whollywinning and ideal comic performers, and they bring a little extrato their roles by making Harold and Kumar smart, nice, real guys whosimply want to have a little fun. In a more subtle stunt that pays off, Reynolds and Eddie Kaye Thomas„thewhite male leads of ""Van Wilder"" and the ""American Pie"" trilogy„havebeen downgraded to supporting parts, with other memorable cameos comingfrom Jamie Kennedy (2003's ""Malibu's Most Wanted""), Ethan Embry (2003's""Timeline""), Anthony Anderson (2004's ""My Baby's Daddy""), and FredWillard (better-used in a single scene than he was in his larger,wasted part in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy""). As Maria,the potential love interest of shy Harold, Paula Garces (2002's ""Clockstoppers"")is cute, but her part is minimal, at best. For the engaging performances by Kal Penn and John Cho, who deserveto be upgraded to further leading roles; for the rib-tickling, no-holds-barredappearance by Neil Patrick Harris (2002's ""Undercover Brother""), whogoes out on a limb to make fun of himself and is all the more admirablefor it; and for all of the arch gags and tart one-liners that workfairly consistently, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is a disaster-prone,buzz-filled trip worth taking for those turned on by knowingly ribaldentertainments. Its unforced mixture of the crass with the sweet (think""Road Trip"" or ""American Pie""-lite) may not be the likeliest of combinations,but it is a decidedly beguiling one, all the same. ",Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,R,2004,3
410,"For twelve months, fans have been anxiously awaiting the release ofthe second film-adapted installment of J.K. Rowling's enormously popular""Harry Potter"" novels. While never having read the books, 2001's ""HarryPotter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was a magical, quality family entertainment.It was a little rough around the edges, with the pace lagging at times,but still managed to weave quite an arresting spell. Once again directedby Chris Columbus, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is bigger,faster, funnier, and darker. It also lacks the deep soul and characternuances of its predecessor, in a race to the finish line that stillclocks in at a robust 161 minutes. Since the film goes by in a relativeflash, Columbus and returning screenwriter could have afforded toslow things down a notch. A new year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is upon 12-year-oldHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), and he couldn't be happier. Unhappyand mistreated by his snotty Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon(Richard Griffiths), Harry is visited by Dobby the House Elf (voicedby Toby Jones), who warns him that he is in grave danger if he returnsto school. Harry predictably doesn't listen and, following a thrillingchase with friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) in a flying car afterthey miss their train, are settled back into Hogwarts. Harry and Ronare also reunited with brainy best friend Hermione (Emma Watson). When students begin to go into a petrified comatose state, Harry,Ron, and Hermione realize something is definitely not right at Hogwarts.Their investigation leads them to the Chamber of Secrets, where amythical giant snake, known as a basilisk, seems to be behind thedire circumstances. Also a suspect is respected giant Hagrid (RobbieColtrane), who is either being set up or whose friendliness may simply be a false facade. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" follows the same generalpattern of ""Sorcerer's Stone:"" a prologue with Harry's miserable relatives;the trip to Hogwarts; the start of classes, friendships, and foes;a Quidditch match; and, finally, the injection of the main storyline.There is a comfort level to this familiar outline, helped immeasurablyby the entire returning cast and a few choice new additions. KennethBranagh (1999's ""Wild Wild West"") is a splashy standout as narcissisticMaster of the Dark Arts Gilderoy Lockhart; Jason Isaacs (2002's ""TheTuxedo"") is appropriately menacing and hateful as Lucius Malfoy, fatherof Harry's bullying classmate Draco (Tom Felton); 36-year-old ShirleyHenderson (2001's ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") amazingly portrays ghostlyschool girl Moaning Myrtle, who haunts the ladies' bathroom; and Dobbythe House Elf is beautifully animated, emotionally endearing, andwell-voiced by Toby Jones. Reprising their central roles, the performances from Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are at the same level they were a yearago--just noticeably getting older. As Harry, Radcliffe is bland butperfectly cast; he represents the heroic everyman, and he does itwell. More entertaining is Rupert Grint, a comic delight as Ron Weasley,and Emma Watson, a lovely Hermione who, unfortunately, has littleto do this time. The adult performers are mostly wasted, but fulfillthe requirements of their roles with sophistication, particularlythe late and great Richard Harris (2002's ""The Count of Monte Cristo""),as Albus Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith (2002's ""Divine Secrets of theYa-Ya Sisterhood""), as the stern but caring Minerva McGonagall.  There are aspects of ""Chamber of Secrets"" that director Chris Columbushas certainly improved upon since ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" although italso may be due to Rowling's source material. The film is quickerand not without a strong helping of edge-of-your-seat action scenes,particularly the flying car ride to Hogwarts and a giant spider attackin the spooky Dark Forest. The Quiddith match has been transformedthis time into the kind of daring and dangerous rollercoaster rideyou would find in a ""Star Wars"" movie, complete with a musical chord(from composer John Williams) that slyly pays homage to George Lucas.And the howler--a screaming letter--that Ron receives from his angrymother (Julie Walters) is superbly realized for the screen. The visualeffects, courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic, are also more seamlessthan they came off in the first picture. Whereas ""Sorcerer's Stone"" took its time in setting up the many ensemblecharacters and their setting, ""Chamber of Secrets"" unfortunately getsbogged down in too many rapid-fire set-pieces, the majority of whichfeel episodic and unconnected to what has come before and what follows.The lack of heartfelt character interaction--particularly the criticalbudding friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione--is too oftensorely overlooked in favor of flashy visuals and plot-heavy exposition.The same goes for the slack treatment of a passing school year. Savefor a single shot of a snowy Hogwarts landscape, the story feels asif it takes place in a matter of weeks, rather than months. Thesekey misjudgments give ""Chamber of Secrets"" a somewhat hollow and rushedcore that it never completely fills.  Problems aside, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is overflowingwith imagination and glorious visuals (the grandly luscious productiondesign by Stuart Craig is a character in and of itself). Despite failingto equal its precursor, the film will entertain adults and is an undoubtedtreat for children, especially because it encourages an expansionof the mind rarely seen in this genre. Had as much time been spenton the writing and development as was obviously spent on the computer-generatedeffects, it could have been a true modern classic. As is, ""Harry Potterand the Chamber of Secrets"" is an engaging and often thrilling experience,but it is far from deep, and doesn't emotionally resound as it should.",Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,PG,2002,3
411,"HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, the third in the series, is directedthis time by Mexican director Alfonso CuarÑn, a surprising choice since hismost recent claim to fame was his NC-17-rated Y TU MAM TAMBIÄN.  His versionof the Potter series is definitely darker and edgier than the first two, and italso carries a very misleading and inappropriate rating of PG.  A film withsome pretty frightening images from vicious werewolves to horrific black-robedcreatures called Dementers who literally suck a guy's face away, it is certainto scare the wits out of little ones, whose parents undoubtedly have a muchlower level of fear in mind when they take their kids to PG-rated movies.  Although I liked this episode better than the two before it, the problem Icontinue to have with the series is that it seems to be preaching only to thechoir.  Sure, the books' fans will continue to love the series, but the moviesdon't offer characters who are compelling enough to care about -- unless, ofcourse, you've already fallen in love with them by reading about them in J.K.Rowling's novels.  Don't get me wrong.  I did have a reasonably good time at HARRY POTTER AND THEPRISONER OF AZKABAN even if I never cared about what happened in the story. The reason is simple.  All of the Harry Potter films are filled withimaginative moments, and none more so than this most recent one.  The villainthis time is Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is out to kill our young lad --more on the ages of the actors in a minute -- Harry Potter.  Sirius's mug isplastered all over town on what has to be the best wanted poster ever. Sirius's snarling and demonic looking face may be on a mere piece of paper, butit is done with a video in a short loop.  The newspapers also feature videoclips.  Other innovative creations include a wacky bus that looks like something thatRoger Rabbit might drive.  The bus can slow time down and can even do a greatsqueeze play to move between heavy traffic.  The bus driver's comical companionis a gabby shrunken head with a heavy Caribbean accent.  There's a cool lookinganimal that's a cross between a horse and an eagle.  Riding or even patting himcan be as dangerous as dealing with hungry bucking bronco.  The kids have amonster textbook with jaws and claws that nip at them constantly.  Rooms arelit with hundreds of floating candles.  There is a giant spider which one ofthe kid wizards incapacitates by making it walk on roller skaters.  And so on. There is cleverness in droves around every corner.  Almost all of the actors are back from the previous film.  In particular,Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint repeat their roles as the threemain kids, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.  The youngsters areall now thirteen, or so we are told.  In real life, when making the movie, theactors were one to two years older, but looked even older still.  This mayprove to a problem for many moviegoers, perhaps if not this time, thencertainly next time.  Of the three, only Watson demonstrates the spunk andcharisma that suggests she might have a chance for a long career after she hasstopped Pottering.  And, interestingly, she is the only one of three who hasnever performed in a Potterless film.    Other than Watson, there is one other actor who deserves special mention.  AlanRickman, as Professor Severus Snape, is terrific with his droll, deadpan humor. But even Rickman isn't enough to make it worth sitting through almosttwo-and-a-half hours of a movie without enough for anyone other than acertified Potter fan.     HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN runs a long 2:21.  It is rated PG for""frightening moments, creature violence and mild language"" and would beacceptable for kids around 10 and up.  My son Jeffrey, age 15, gave the film ****, which he has given to every one inthe series -- although he said that he thought this one was the best.  He likedthe suspense, the special effects, the action and the creatures.  He especiallyliked Professor Lupin (David Thewlis), a new character, and Emma Watson, who hethought was hot.  Although his interests in the Harry Potter books have waned,his love of the Potter films hasn't. ",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,PG,2004,2.5
412,"For the many, many fans of the novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer'sStone,"" the main question about the highly anticipated movie is ""Werethe filmmakers true to the book?"" The answer is that they were true to afault. ""Harry Potter"" is a rich, wildly imaginative movie with enoughold-school Brothers Grimm bite to keep it from becoming saccharine. Thesets and situations are grand and wondrous, but the powers that be, intheir zeal to include as much from the book as is humanly possible, haveoverstuffed the film almost to the breaking point.  During the first half of its mammoth 153 minutes, the production is sobusy hopping from one vignette, secondary storyline or characterintroduction to another that it doesn't have time to address theplotline of its title. When it finally does, it does so breathlessly,often forgetting to take a moment or two to drink in the wonder. Isuspect that future editions of the series will be more sound, now thatthe laborious groundwork has been laid.  Incidentally, please don't mistake my complaints about ""Harry Potter andthe Sorcerer's Stone"" as anything approaching condemnation. Even withits flaws, this is still an extremely entertaining piece of work thatdeserves the massive audience it surely will attract.  Thankfully, for every misstep, the filmmakers do a great deal right.First off, there is no attempt to Americanize the thoroughly Britishtale. The sensibilities are as British as the cast, which includes averitable laundry list of beloved U.K. actors. The three young leadplayers, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, are alsoEnglish. As Harry Potter, Radcliffe is appropriately earnest and heroic.In the roles of his best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley,Watson and Grint have some problems with their delivery, but they getthe nature of their characters right.  For 11-year old Harry Potter, the opportunity to attend the HogwartsSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a godsend. Reared in horribleconditions by his aunt and uncle (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths)after the death of his parents (they were murdered by an evil wizard,but Harry was told they died in an accident), the boy is only too eagerfor a fresh start, which begins for him at train station, specificallyat platform 9 _.  Once he finds the entrance, he slides into a world where the impossibleis the norm, provided you know the right incantation. With 9-foot Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane, sporting a body-length Afro) serving as his mentor,Harry visits a bank staffed with ornery goblins. Harry eyes thetrendiest magic wands in a neighboring store window before heading offto Hogwarts.  Oh, what a facility it is. Massive, handsome and vaguely threatening,the sprawling estate boasts hundreds of students, overseen by HeadmasterDumbledore (Richard Harris), the prime but understanding ProfessorMcGonagall (Maggie Smith), sinister Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and ahost of others.  We get an extended look at Harry's first game of Quidditch, a thrillingsport involving 50-foot golden goalposts, a variety of balls and studentathletes zooming through the air on their broomsticks trying to scoregoals. We also get quick glimpses of numerous characters who will getmore screentime in subsequent films.  Just as the parade of vignettes begins to grow tiresome, the centralplot kicks in. The Sorcerer's Stone is in danger of being stolen by theevil Voldemort, who is manipulating one of the professors to do hisbidding. Can Harry and his new friends Hermoine and Ron save the stoneand the school without getting in trouble for being in an unauthorizedarea? Or will they be distracted by the angry troll in the girls'bathroom, the chocolate frog that keeps leaping out of its box, thegiant three-headed dog or the majestic stairways, which periodicallymove from one location to another?  If this sounds appealing, but extremely jumbled, then you know what toexpect. Potter veterans (and with book sales of over 100 million, thereare a lot of them) will have no trouble keeping up, of course. Foreveryone else, I suggest you dive in and hang on, secure in theknowledge that all will become clear in the next film, ""Harry Potter andthe Sequel That Doesn't Bite Off More than It Can Chew."" ",Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,PG,2001,3
413," HEAD OVER HEELS, a romantic comedy twist on REAR WINDOW, stars Monica Potter as amateur sleuth Amanda Pierce and Freddie Prinze Jr. as Jim Winston, a fashion exec who may or may not have murdered a woman in his apartment.  Amanda, a Renaissance painting restorer by trade, thinks she saw the murder through the window of her Manhattan apartment.  If you can't figure out whether Jim is actually a murderer, consider your inability as prima facie evidence that you need a break, since you are clearly below your minimum movie quota.  ""There are four million men in New York,"" Amanda complains soon after we meet her.  ""Why can't I find just one.  Just one!""  Well, when she lays eyes on the poster-boy-handsome Jim, it is love at first sight, at least for her.  They meet inauspiciously when the monster-sized dog he is walking knocks her down and starts trying to hump her.  Like much of the movie, it sounds funnier that it is.  Soon, Amanda goes from being weak-kneed over her art to swooning at the sight of a flesh-and-blood man.  Breaking off their conversation on the street, she tells Jim, ""I've got the runs.  I mean I've got to run.""  The script by Ron Burch and David Kidd sporadically comes up with such cute dialog, but, too often, it falls back on the old clich_s of everyone literally falling head over heels.  Falling as a laughter-inducing stunt gets old after about the second fall. Okay, maybe the third.  Given that director Mark S. Waters's first and only other film is the wonderfully edgy, black comedy, THE HOUSE OF YES, also featuring Prinze, one might reasonably assume that HEAD OVER HEELS would take risks.  Instead, it plays it as safe as a TV movie remake of a Doris Day comedy.    Amanda rents a closet in an apartment owned by four models, Jade (Shalom Harlow), Roxana (Ivana Milicevic), Candi (Sarah O'Hare) and Holly (Tomiko Fraser), whose weights and IQs hover around 100.  Amanda's room is literally a closet, since they have turned the closet's bedroom into a storage area large enough to hold their bulging wardrobe.  Every night outside the models' door, a horde of hunks assembles, wanting to be the models' salivating slaves for the evening.  The models treat the men like dirt while squandering their money.  The movie never gets the proper comedic payoff from the models because it never ratchets up the sleaze factor enough.  Still, some easy jabs at their desire to destroy their bodies for the sake of their profession do come across as funny.  One model, for example, is in the process of having her earlobes fixed so that they will be perfectly symmetric.  As Amanda tries to find out if Jim is a dreamboat or a killer, she falls hopelessly in love with him.  The movie's fatal flaw is that theirs is a one-way romance.  We believe that Amanda loves Jim.  We never believe that the feeling is genuinely reciprocated, and their chemistry together has as many sparks as a California blackout.  A romantic comedy requires not only laugher, but love.  And love has to be a two-way street.  HEAD OVER HEELS runs 1:31.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual content, crude humor and language and would be acceptable for kids around 11 or 12 and up.  My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the movie ** 1/2.  Although he thought the movie was funny in parts, especially those involving the models, he thought the plot was flat and needed improvement.   ",Head Over Heels,PG-13,2001,2
414,"A kinda-sorta cross between the 1992 Eddie Murphy vehicle ""The DistinguishedGentleman"" and the 1993 Kevin Kline comedy ""Dave,"" what ""Head of State""lacks in originality it makes up for with its sharp-witted, oftenvery funny satire of the presidential election races. What also helpsis having comedian Chris Rock co-write and direct himself. While hisprevious starring roles have been in lackluster movies that did adisservice to his talent (2002's ""Bad Company,"" anyone?), ""Head ofState,"" at least in part, recaptures just how good Rock can be. He,above all, knows what is funny and how to get a laugh, and there isenough energy in the proceedings to carry him through this lightweight entertainment. With the presidential election only two months away and suddenly noone running opposite current Vice President Brian Lewis (Nick Searcy),party leader Senator Bill Arnot (James Rebhorn) chooses straight-talkingD.C. Alderman Mays Gilliam (Chris Rock) as his nominee. With DebraLassiter (Lynn Whitfield) and Martin Geller (Dylan Baker) acting ashis advisors, Mays suddenly finds himself at the forefront of thepublic's attention, as he travels around the U.S. to try to sway thevote away from the generic, dishonest Lewis. Mays surprises when hishonesty and matter-of-fact opinions about the nation's issues capturesthe voters' attention, suddenly making him a threat to Arnot, whohas intentionally elected him to lose so he himself will have a clearshot to run for President in 2008. The source of fun in ""Head of State"" is that, while much of the comedystems from white-black relations, it does it in a clever, entertainingtone that doesn't overtly play the race card (think Martin Lawrencein 2003's dismally offensive ""National Security""). Its jabs at theelection races are also tart and edgy, perfectly timely in today'spolitical climate, as the public questions President Bush's qualifications,or lack thereof. A running gag in which nominee Lewis is always backinghimself up by touting that he is Sharon Stone's cousin is quite funny,as is his tagline (""God bless America, and no place else!""). After a string of motion pictures that haven't satisfactorily showcasedChris Rock's comedic skills (he is known mostly for his hilarious,profane stand-up routines), Rock has finally put pen to paper, takingmatters into his own hands. As Mays Gilliam, an all-around nice guywho isn't above speaking his mind, Rock is front and center in theaction, effortlessly garnering big laughs. If there is a criticismto be made, it should be toward the studio, Dreamworks Pictures, whohave forced him to make a PG-13 comedy when an R would have reallygiven Rock the liberty to do his thing. As is, there are times whenRock is unfortunately forced to hold back. As Mays' big brother, Mitch, who greets people by punching or slappingthem across the face, Bernie Mac (2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"") is mostlybackground dressing, only popping up for a handful of scenes. It'sjust as well--while Mac gets some laughs, he is decidedly weaker atinhabiting an actual screen character than Rock is. On the femaleside, Robin Givens goes deliciously over-the-top as Kim, Mays' unhingedex-girlfriend from hell, while Tamala Jones (2000's ""The Ladies Man"")plays things sweet as Lisa, a gas station attendant whom Mays fallsfor. The romance between Mays and Lisa is underutilized in the film'swhole scheme of things, although it does its job. There isn't much that is terribly wrong with ""Head of State;"" it'sjust that there's precious little for the viewer to walk away with.Successful laughs are scattered throughout the brisk 95-minute runningtime, but there are almost as many that fail to taking off the landingstrip. The result is a crowd-pleasing comedy, entertaining enough(mainly because of Chris Rock) for audiences in search of nothingmore than a few good chuckles, but too slight to be a completely memorable experience.",Head of State,PG-13,2003,2.5
415,"Marlee Matlin is a great actress, and it is real pity thatwe don't see her more often in the movies. Unfortunately,that seems to be case because of her own affliction. Beingdeaf herself, she has rather limited pool of availableroles, but when she gets any of them, the audience isrewarded with truly remarkable performances. One of theexamples is HEAR NO EVIL, 1993 thriller directed by RichardGreenwald.  In this movie Matlin plays Jillian Shanahan, deaf exerciseinstructor who, without knowing, got involved in ratherdangerous situation. Her friend, journalist Micky O'Malley(played by John C. McGinley) got into the possession ofrare, valuable and stolen coin. Before being blown up in hiscar, Micky had stashed the coin in Jillian's apartment.Jillian is now becoming the target of Lieutenant Brock(Martin Sheen), ferocious corrupt cop who sees the coin ashis own retirement fund. She is also being stalked bymysterious figure dressed in black. The only help comes inthe shape of Ben Kendall (D.B. Sweeney), mountain climberthat also happens to fall in love with her.  Although not very original in concept and borrowing a lotfrom WAIT UNTIL DARK, 1967 classic with Audrey Hepburn asblind woman in similar situation, HEAR NO EVIL is very goodthriller. The crime subplot is unoriginal and veryformulaic, full of usual Hollywood plot holes andimplausibilities. On the other hand, the atmosphere of thefilm is very well-done, Oregon locations seems refreshing,and sometimes, the horror that waits our heroine can besensed by the audience too. The best thing in this film isin actors' performances. Marlee Matlin is superb, and shehas a good chemistry in the romantic scenes with D.B.Sweeney. Martin Sheen is also good in very reserved, yetmenacing role of corrupt policeman. All in all, HEAR NO EVILis film with weak concept, but the execution so good thatdeserves praise. ",Hear No Evil,R,1993,2
416,"In David Mirkin's HEARTBREAKERS, a sweet comedy which plays like alighthearted version of THE GRIFTERS, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer LoveHewitt are a mother/daughter pair of con artists.  Although they scam foreverything from food to gas, their specialty is marriage settlements.   When we first meet our connivers, Max (Weaver) is marrying Dean Cumanno (RayLiotta), a respectable New Jersey chop shop owner.  When his new secretary,Page (Hewitt), entices him into a little oral sex, his wife of 18 hoursarrives to catch them in the act.  ""Honey, it isn't what it looks likehere,"" Dean tries to explain to Max.  ""Her hair got stuck in my zipper.""Cut to the lawyers office in which Max leaves with a chunk of cash and oneof Dean's freshly built Mercedes.   Although they look like Mutt and Jeff with their dramatic height difference,Weaver and Hewitt are a convincing and funny choice as relatives and rivals.The rebellious Page thinks that Max treats her like a little kid, and Maxthinks that Page isn't ready to go solo like she plans.  Their confidencegames are quite believable.  Max looks like someone who would sweep you offyour feet into an early marriage proposal.  And Page, with her lovely legs,micro skirts and ERIN BROCKOVICH-type bras that push her generous breastsskyward, looks like someone who might tempt even the most married of marriedmen.  In short, the deliciously caustic chemistry between Weaver and Hewittis the best part of the movie.   The weakest link, other than the excessive running time, is the supportingcast.  Although Liotta is impressive, most of the others are eitherunderutilized or miscast.  Anne Bancroft delivers a wooden performance as anIRS agent who forces the two crooks into their most ambitious scam ever.Jason Lee (ALMOST FAMOUS), who isn't given much to do as the only guy withwhom Page ever falls in love, phones in his performance. As a clich_ of a rich old geezer with yellow teeth, Gene Hackman coughs hisway through his part as William B. Tensy, a tobacco company CEO withmillions to burn.  If he will just live long enough to tie the knot withMax, she and her daughter will be able to pay their back taxes and live oneasy street for the rest of their lives.  But Page hates the whole idea.""I'm not dating the walking dead,"" she bitterly informs her mother, whoreplies, ""we better work fast."" In Tensy's most memorable line, he reveals the secret of what really turnson a tobacco millionaire -- ""smoke billowing out of a woman's hot, rednostrils.""  The image almost makes the unflappable, non-smoking Max gag.Gag isn't something you will do while watching this brightly written comedy.HEARTBREAKERS isn't any laugh riot, but it is entertaining fun.  It's thesort of picture that will leave you with a smile on your face and a feelingthat you got your money's worth. HEARTBREAKERS runs needlessly long at 2:03.  It is officially rated PG-13for sex-related content including dialogue, and with scenes of oral sex andbondage, this is certainly a film unsuitable for those under 13.",Heartbreakers,PG-13,2001,3
417,"      HEAT is a action movie of great energy and excellent stunts thatmasquerades as an epic.  The plot can easily be summarized as catchases mouse, mouse chases cat, and cat and mouse stop to share a cupof coffee.       HEAT is a new movie written and directed by Michael Mann (THE LASTOF THE MOHICANS, MANHUNTER, THIEF, and the TV series ""Miami Vice"").  Ithas fours sets of characters: good guys (cops), bad guys (robbers), alltheir families, and the people doing the stunts.  It is an intriguing,but exhausting movie where only two aspects (bad guys and the stunts)of the movie work.  It is an interesting movie with lots of action somost viewers will leave the theater satisfied and yet it has thepotential for much more that it delivers.       As the show starts, a group of robbers by the names of NeilMcCauley (Robert De Niro), Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), MichaelCheritto (Tom Sizemore), and Waingro (Kevin Gage) are gathering for anelaborate but precisely coordinated heist.  They are going to take amassive pickup truck of the size that is used to pickup semis and ramit into an armored car.  These are cold blooded killers who terminatetheir victims with no remorse and little reason.  The action sequencehere is impressive and the best part is the sound effects - massivesteel on steel impact.  Shades of the DIE HARD series.       Detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) arrives on the scene soonafter the crime has been completed and the chase is on.  Early on, eachside learns the identity of the other so that the movie consists ofHanna and company, Detective Casals (Wes Studi), Detective Drucker(Mykelti Williamson), etc., watching the bad guys and waiting for themto commit the big one.       While waiting for the inevitable capture, they get to philosophizea lot on their roles in life.  Detective Hanna says, ""I've got a lot ofangst.  I preserve it, I hold it, it keeps me sharp where I've got tome.""  Neil McCauley explains to Hanna, ""I do what I do best; I takescores.  You do what you do best and try to catch bad guys like me.""Several times during the show McCauley reminds us of his guidingprinciple, ""Do not get attached to anything you can not walk out on inthirty seconds flat if the heat comes around the corner.""  Shakespearethis isn't.       The movie has many an exhilarating action scene full of greatsound effects especially of assault-weapons.  Sorry to say that sinceMann believes he is creating something on the scale of the GODFATHERsagas, he pads the movie with numerous and superfluous family scenes.None of them work.  Both sides are married to dysfunctional butultimately boring families.  The only point the families seem to serveis to say that both good guys and bad guys have families to distractthem and that the families on both sides look and act alike.       The female roles in the movie, Justine Hanna (Diane Venora), Eady(Amy Brenneman), and Charlene Shiherlis (Ashley Judd), are all poorlywritten.  Justine complains to her husband that ""I may be stoned ongrass and Prozac, but you've been walking through my life dead.""  Theonly scenes with a female in it that work are a tragic one that willtear your heart out when a girl teenager is dying as well as Eady'stragic expression in a great scene towards the end.       The robbers are quite well done.  The makeup and the costumes addto their aura of evil.  De Niro has a sinister goatee and slick blackhair, while his mentor, Nate (Jon Voight), has a pock marked facereminiscent of the moon and sickly eyes that make him looked wasted asif he has indeed been dissipated by a life of crime.  The acting by therobbers is excellent.  De Niro delivers a strong but controlledperformance as do Kilmer and Voight.  Pacino, on the other hand, losescontrol emotionally in almost every scene.  The script attempts tocompensate by giving him a plethora of expletives for adjectives withwhich to scare the crooks.       Now we come to believability.  This is where the movie earns itslowest scores.  Let's take a quiz.  If someone is firing a stream ofbullets from an assault-weapon into your windshield, would drive keepdriving straight into him?  If you are surrounded by hundreds ofpolicemen and you have to fired constantly for many minutes, would younever need to reload?  In this case, would you expect to kill scores ofpolice but get away unscathed yourself?  If you are a cop and a killeris holding a little girl hostage while spinning around rapidly, wouldyou shot at him?  If you are a cop, would you push a guy through aplate glass window to make him talk?  If you were able to answer all ofthese in the affirmative, you may have a lucrative career in front ofyou in Hollywood.  Give the studio (Warner Brothers) a call now and setup an interview.  Your fortune awaits.       The music is bland - made up mostly of pseudo-haunting violinmelodies.  The camera work is good and fast paced in the actionsequences, but it has too many hyper close-ups in the family scenes.When Pacino's nose covers the entire screen at the local monsterplex,you feel like you are viewing Mount Rushmore.       HEAT runs (sometime crawls) 2:51, but there is really only enoughmaterial for two hours.  It is correctly rated R as it is full ofviolence with more deaths that you can hope to count.  I do notremember any nudity, but there was a little sex.  It is suitable onlyfor mature teenagers.  I liked all of the bad guys and the stunts areterrific, but ultimately I have to give the movie a mild thumbs down.It gets ** from me. ",Heat,R,1995,2.5
418,"""What are we going to do?"" Fran Moore (Rebecca Pidgeon) asks her husband, Joe(Gene Hackman), the gang's mastermind.  ""That's what everybody wants to know,""he replies.  And that's what viewers will keep asking themselves in HEIST, asmartly written crime caper filled with twists and double crosses fromwriter/director David Mamet.  The clever script has more than enough dead endsand head fakes to keep you guessing.    With a wide variety of films to his credit, including STATE AND MAIN, THEWINSLOW BOY and my favorite, HOUSE OF GAMES, David Mamet has a great trackrecord.  In his impressive canon, the movie that HEIST will most remind you ofis THE SPANISH PRISONER.  His signature style is the staccato dialog in whichshort sentences are like bullets packed for maximum impact.  How cool is Joe? ""He's so cool that when he goes to sleep, the sheep count him,"" Pinky (RickyJay), one of Joe's men, remarks about him.  The plot has Joe and his team, which includes Pinky, Fran and Bobby (DelroyLindo), reluctantly taking on a hotheaded newbie, Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell,GALAXY QUEST), because Jimmy's relative, Bergman (Danny DeVito), demands it. Bergman is supplying the cash to finance Joe and Co.'s heists, and Bergman wantsa man on the inside of their operation after a previous job of Joe's goesslightly sour.  Joe's effectiveness comes from more than his coolness under pressure.  Hisbrilliance is best shown in his meticulously planned backup schemes.  He doesn'tjust prepare Plans A, B and C.  He apparently works his way through the entirealphabet given how well he is able to react to unexpected circumstances.  And how cool is his wife?  Fran, Joe claims, ""could talk her way out of asunburn.""    As the time runs out on the caper, it becomes a game in which whoever has thegold last wins.  The audience will win regardless, since they get to enjoy thegolden dialog.  Joe, for example, doesn't like people pointing guns at himunless they plan to shoot.  Why?  Because otherwise, ""It's insincere.""  HEIST runs 1:47.  It is rated R for ""language and some violence"" and would beacceptable for kids around 12 and up.  My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film ***.  He liked it all, especially thetwists.

Bernie Laplante (Dustin Hoffmann),a small-time crook, happens to break down on a bridge just as a planeplummets into the river before him.  Against his ingrained charactertraits, he soon finds himself amongst the shattered fuselage, draggingpassengers to safety, including, as fate would have it, Channel 4'sratings-hungry presenter (Geena Davis).  Although the eternally suspiciousLaplante skulks away from prying eyes, Channel 4 has soon picked up onthis 'Angel of Flight 104', offering one million dollars for his story.Except they get their story from a fraud (Andy Garcia).The lionisation of this fake hero is where the movie really shifts intogear.  Interest in this apparent rags-to-riches success reaches fever pitch.At one point John visits a children's ward, touching patients like aMessiah and waking a child from a coma.  Davis falls for him.  Laplante,a petty criminal, who deep down loves his family, finally proves himselfthe true hero, once again, when a disillusioned John prepares to throwhimself from a ledge. Hoffmann carries the film.

His multi-layeredcharacter is a bundle of Woody Allenesque insecurities, with a professionalthief's beady eyes.  (He is introduced swiping his own lawyer's pursein the middle of a courtroom.)  But he also gives his villain a heart,without ever lapsing into sentimentality.Davis excels as Gail Gayley, a cynical newsreader who falls for thehandsome man her news channel has fashioned into a public hero from a hobo.   Andy Garcia is also excellent as John Bubber, an opportunist with a conscience. ",Hero,PG-13,1992,3.5

Only an explosive finale woke the kids and caused a smallburst of laughter.    The lead for the series is a strange looking kid named Arnold (voiced by SpencerKlein).  With a ""football head,"" yellow hair that appears parted like the RedSea and a mouth that floats from side to side like a pair of loose dentures,Arnold is only one of many strangely drawn characters in the show.  The minimal plot provides the canonical and questionable cartoon message thatbusinesses are always big, bad and out to exploit the environment.  The storythis time concerns an evil conglomerate named Future Tech Industries (FTi) thatis about destroy the neighborhood.  Arnold and friends try to stop FTi's CEOScheck (voiced by Paul Sorvino) by organizing protests and even dynamiting thestreet in order to stop his bulldozers.  ""Losers!"" Arnold's friend Helga (voiced by Francesca Smith) yells at Arnold andhis buddies when she gets angry at them.  You'll be a loser if you chose HEYARNOLD! THE MOVIE over much better fare like LILO & STITCH.    HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE runs a very long 1:16.  It is rated PG for ""some thematicelements"" and would be acceptable for all ages.  My son Jeffrey, age 13, gave it no stars whatsoever.  He said that it wasseventy-six minutes of boredom and that the plot was almost non-existent. ",Hey Arnold! The Movie,PG,2002,1.5
422,"Americans opposed to the bombings in Afghanistan point tothe some 3,000 innocent civilians allegedly killed there duringrecent months.  Since the statistic might be written off ascollateral damage that cannot be helped, no military tribunalsare to be expected to indict Americans for their role in thatmishap.  Not so the case of Lt. Calley, who during the Nixonadministration was indicted, tried and convicted for thesenseless massacre of innocent  villagers during the VietnamWar.  Calley was portrayed as a cold-blooded, racist fighter whohad no use for Vietnamese on either side.   In its progression of events, Carl Franklin's ""High Crimes""recalls the Calley case.  Based on Joseph Finder's novel, whichwas set in Boston, ""High Crimes"" takes place in San Francisco,a military base in Oakland and in the Mexican state of Morelosstanding in for a village in El Salvador where in 1988, during theAmerican advisory role in that small country's civil war,  nineinnocent people were butchered by an American.  Why the casewas even brought up some twelve years after the murders is notexplained, and several actions of the plot are difficult if notimpossible to believe but that's the name of the game with thegenre of films that portray high American officials as corrupt,eager to cover up their mistakes even at the expense ofinnocent Americans. ""High Crimes"" is a fairly conventional story revolving aroundthe court-martial of a loving guy living the good life inCalifornia's Marin County.  As is typical there are twists, thoughthe principal one can probably be figured out by fans of thegenre.  What makes the movie absorbing throughout is thestrong performance of Ashley Judd in the role of successful triallawyer Claire Kubik, a woman not only familiar enough with thelaw to get her clients off on technicalities if need be but one whois forceful enough to persist until she gets her way.  She'd haveto be that sort to pursue her latest case, given the many timesshe is beaten up, in one case almost dying when a bad guysucceeds in plunging her with her car over a cliff.  Then again,Claire is defending her husband, Tom Kubik (Jim Caviezel), aloving family man who is in full agreement with Claire's desirefor a baby.  He's the sort of man-next-door, possibly given tostuttering or looking at his feet when he talks, that we want tosee cleared of a difficulty he now finds himself in. While Tom's court-martial is the focal point of the movie, mostof the action, fortunately, takes place outside the judicialchambers, beginning when Tom is arrested by a contingent ofmilitary police on a busy San Francisco street and charged withthe murder of nine Salvadorians a dozen years before.  When awimpy young attorney who has never won a case, Embry (AdamScott), is assigned to defend Tom, Claire realizes that someintervention is needed, particularly since she may have seenenough movies to realize that military justice is an oxymoron. While Embry is busy being seduced by Claire's good-time sisterJackie (Amanda Peet), Claire locates crackerjack lawyer Grimes(Morgan Freeman), who has lately been out of the actionbecause of his fondness for the juice.  ""High Crimes"" could not have been better cast. Ashley Juddlooks better than even with a short haircut, the snappy attire ofan advocate bucking for partner, and her give and take withMorgan Freeman displays all the chemistry we'd want from sucha team.  A supporting cast includes Bruce Davison as Brig.General Marks and Juan Carlos Hernandez as MajorHernandez, two bureaucrats of the sort that we in the audiencehave learned to hate knowing, as we do, how power corruptsthe honchos in the FBI, the CIA, and the heads of the variousdivisions of the armed forces.  ""High Crimes"" is good, escapistentertainment, at times too predictable, but more thanwatchable because of its stellar bunch of performers.",High Crimes,PG-13,2002,2
423,"In this romantic comedy, John Cusack plays a self-confessedmusic junkie who owns Championship Vinyl, a dilapidated record storein downtown Chicago. Having just been dumped by his girl-friend(delectable Danish actress Iben Hjejle), he spends his days playingverbal trivia games with his two moronic employees (Todd Louiso, JackBlack), who share his encyclopedic knowledge of pop music and themusic scene, and most nights morbidly picking at the scab of hisemotional misery. In the form of an into-the-camera confessional, hechronicles the failed relationships that repeated his first rejectionat age 14 in junior high school. ""Did I listen to pop music because Iwas miserable or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?"" hemuses, organizing his record collection, not alphabetically orchronologically, but autobiographically, so he has to remember theconnections.  While he considers himself unlucky in love, his ex'sinclude Catherine Zeta Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter and LisaBonet. Joan Cusack plays his pal while Tim Robbins is hilarious as arival suitor. Based on a novel by Nick Hornby, it's been cleverlyadapted by D.V. DeVincentis & Steve Pink & John Cusack, who workedtogether on Grosse Pointe Blank, plus Scott Rosenberg and perceptivelydirected by Stephen Frears, who makes Cusack into a self-reflectingEveryman who wonders if he'll ever find true love. With hisingratiating charm and impeccable timing, Cusack is not only likablebut believable. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, High-Fidelityis an honest, funny, ironic 8.

424,"  This is the fourth segment, the first in five years, and thefinal episode of the series.  If you're not a die-hard fan, you needto know some background. The Highlander is an immortal, born centuriesago in the Scotland. He and the other immortals who walk the earth,calling themselves ""the seed of legend,"" can be killed only whenbeheaded, which usually occurs in a sword-fight with anotherimmortal. The victor in such a duel gets the ""quickening,"" absorbingthe strength and experience of the defeated amid bolts of lightning.Morose Christopher Lambert stars, once again, as Connor MacLeod withAdrian Paul as his protege, Duncan MacLeod, who - this time - go afterJacob Kell (Bruce Payson), an evil, diabolical, power-hungry immortalwho has gone renegade. Kell's after Connor because, centuries ago,Connor killed his father, which is understandable since Kell burnedConnor's mother at the stake. Make no mistake, this is a gruesomegroup and the recitation of their history is oftencontradictory. Plus, Duncan's got this girl-friend (LisaBarbuscia). Anyway, both MacLeods are determined that Kell will not bethe last immortal - ""In the end, there can be only one."" Problem is:it's disjointed and tiresome. Even the choreography of thesword-fights is clunky and choppy. Blame that on first-time directorDouglas Aarniokoski. The gimmick is that Lambert, who's starred in the""Highlander"" films, is now teamed with Paul, star of the syndicated TVseries (1992-98). The two, supposedly born 70 years apart in the 16thcentury, have appeared together only in the first episode of the TVseries. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Highlander: Endgame""is a dreadful, time-traveling, almost incomprehensible 2.

425," One of the most powerful images in Anaud Tucker's ""Hilary and Jackie,"" is of Jackie de Pre (Emily Watson) sitting in her living room all alone, shaking violently, a sufferer of multiple sclerosis. Heartbreaking moments like this, mixed with observant scenes involving cello playing, is what caused, ""Hilary and Jackie,"" to be such a natural and human drama.  The film, based on the autobiography by Hilary de Pre, entitled, A Genius in the Family, spans four decades, from the 1950's to the 1980's, as it follows two close-knit sisters, Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jackie, who, during childhood, were masterful at playing the flute and cello, and won many competitions. As they grew up, however, they took different paths. Hilary, realizing how inferior she was to her younger sister at playing, gave up the flute and married Daniel Barenboim (James Frain), moving to the secluded countryside of England. Meanwhile, Jackie, who knows she cannot live without her sister, goes into a deep depression, nearly giving up the cello, and just as she began performing again, was ultimately diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  ""Hilary and Jackie,"" follows a rather basic, ordinary storyline, and although some of it could be telegraphed in advance, other sections of the picture genuinely surprised me. Also throwing conventional storytelling to the winds, a la Quentin Tarantino, the film follows Hilary through a large portion of her life, and then circles back, following Jackie's point-of-view during the same time frame. Although there was no real purpose to choose such a style, the film, I think, grew because of this. By showing Hilary's perspective, and then Jackie's, there are many revelations in the characters, and we are able to understand more deeply what Jackie, confused and lonely, was going through.  After giving one of the breakthrough performances of the decade in 1996's brilliant, ""Breaking the Waves,"" Emily Watson has created another thorough, exact character, and yet Jackie is quite different from her ""Waves"" character, Bess. When she grows more and more helpless from the disease, the film became occasionally too heart-rending to sit through, but director Anaud Tucker should be applauded for not looking away from multiple sclerosis. He courageously chose, instead, to look the illness straight in its face, in all of its tragedy and sadness. Rachel Griffiths, as Hilary, is every bit the perfect match for Watson, and one particular scene involving her during the conclusion was particularly moving.   The other performances in the film were not quite as good, or memorable, because they were all mostly underwritten. This flaw did not much affect my feelings for the film, however, because this is a story about two sisters, not about their various husbands and family, although we do get a look into their childhoods. Played superbly as children by Keely Flanders and Auriol Evans, the early scenes were especially effective because of the sense we got, in which, as Jackie surpassed Hilary in her talent of an instrument, her parents sort of pushed Hilary to the side, as if she wasn't as important.  It isn't really giving anything away to say that Jackie du Pre, unfortunately, died at the age of 42 in 1987, due to her illness. ""Hilary and Jackie,"" is a glorious, seemingly accurate tribute to this obvious talent, who has widely been considered the greatest musical prodigy of the 20th-century. The fact that her life was unfairly cut short seems like a crime, since she was an overall good person who happened to have a lot of internal and emotional conflicts throughout her life. The final scene, set at an unidentified, dreamy beach, and involving the two sisters as children, returned to the set-up of the opening sequence, and not only was the cinematography by David Johnson gorgeous to look at, but the implications of what is said in the scene was a thought-provoking and poignant way to conclude the ode to Jackie du Pre's life.  ",Hilary and Jackie,R,1999,3.5
426,"HOLLOW MAN isn't your father's INVISIBLE MAN.  From audacious director PaulVerhoeven (STARSHIP TROOPERS, BASIC INSTINCT and SHOWGIRLS), HOLLOW MAN iserotic, fascinating, imaginative, gory and, yes, a bit scary.   Starring Kevin Bacon as a bold bastard of a scientist named Sebastian Caine,the movie also stars Elisabeth Shue as Linda Foster, Sebastian's coworkerand ex-flame, and Josh Brolin as Matt Kensington, their coworker and Linda'scurrent squeeze.  Sebastian still pines for Linda and doesn't initially knowabout her relationship with Matt.  The sexually charged script by Andrew W.Marlowe (AIR FORCE ONE) uses this romantic triangle as a key subplot. Deep underground in a top-secret military lab, Sebastian leads a team ofcrack scientists who have learned how to make animals invisible and bringthem back to visibility, with the latter transformation being the hardest.Sebastian decides that, like Jonas Salk, he will himself be the first humanguinea pig for his drug. The movie's special effects are amazing.  Graphic and gory, they showanimals and a human going in and out of visibility.  Basically the processstarts with the skin disappearing.  The reversal begins with the veinsappearing.  Medical schools would pay big money for this.  Try as you may,you will not be able to look away, just like you have to see car accidentseven if you know you should cast your eyes away. The script is as humorous as it is inventive.  Sebastian, for example, tellsa great ribald joke involving Superman and Wonder Woman.  Women, however,may have trouble sleeping or being alone after seeing the film.  The movieplays up to men's secret voyeuristic desires -- Want to see that gorgeouswoman next door?  Just slip in unannounced and unseen. -- so men may findthe film more exciting than troubling.   Bacon is creepy and cocky.  He plays the type of character you love to hate.""You don't make history by following the rules"", Sebastian, who likes torefer to himself as God, tells Linda.  ""You make it by seizing the moment."" Shue is almost as sexy as she was in her Oscar-nominated part in LEAVING LASVEGAS, and she even shows that she can be a credible action hero in theSigourney Weaver mold.  She is clearly an actress who should be cast moreoften. The film's opening sequence of an innocent mouse being eaten alive by aninvisible predator serves notice of what is coming up.  If you wereexpecting some innocuous and cute invisible man movie, you are warned thatthis isn't it and that you should quickly head for the exit. For those who stay the movie is great fun.  The film even thumbs its nose atthe MPAA rating board.  Knowing that the MPAA will allow frontal nudity inan R film so long as it's not male nudity, the director shows Bacon's penisflapping as he walks.  But it is done with a thermal image so that it canbe argued that it wasn't really shown at all.   ""What would you do if you knew you couldn't be seen?"" Sebastian asks.  Anintriguing question which HOLLOW MAN explores in some obvious butthought-provoking ways.  As though he has a devil and an angel on hisshoulders, Sebastian argues with himself.  ""Don't even think about it,"" hesays about something that he knows he shouldn't do.  But then he adds,""Who's going to know?""  Only in the end, when the film dissolves into a cross between ALIENS and atypical slasher flick, does it ever let us down some.  But in the film'sdefense, it never takes itself too seriously, so that even the concludingsegment is enjoyable.  The real difference is that the ending doesn't havequite the freshness of the rest of the picture.   HOLLOW MAN runs 1:45.  It is rated R for strong violence, gore, language,nudity and sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers. Email: Steve.Rhodes@InternetReviews.com Web: http://www.InternetReviews.com",Hollow Man,R,2000,2.5
427,"Anyone who has been on the psychotherapist's couch foryears, even weeks, can tell you exactly what problems he faces. He can talk about these issues until he's blue in the face, butalas, as any decent shrink will tell you, knowing intellectuallythat you have a problem is not the same as working it outemotionally.  In that respect, no one can say that Woody Allen isin denial about his.  One of the genius directors of the pastthirty-seven years, the sixty-six year old Mr. Allen never hid thefact to the public that he has been undergoing therapy forever. He realizes that he's a hypochondriac (in one self-reflective filmhe opens an attache case loaded to the brim with pills), butknowing in your head that the illness has no physical causality isnot the same as exuding a feeling of health and well-being.  Hissuccess as a filmmaker, writer and actor has apparently notdiminished his neuroses or cured his anhedonia, but to hiseternal credit he makes art out of misery, thereby delighting therest of us, if not himself.  In ""Hollywood Ending"" Woody may notbe at his best (that spot is reserved for ""Annie Hall,"") butwhereas an ordinary person talking about his operation maybore the hell out of his circle of pals, Woody has a way ofmaking his own dilemmas delightful to those discriminating fanswho adore even flops like ""Interiors"" and ""Shadows and Fog.""     Neurotic he may be but at least he's learned to do what hedoes best and that's to make people laugh.  So it's goodbyeKafka, hello ""Hollywood Ending,"" a delightful movie with expertcomic timing which, despite a few lines that fall flat or are evenembarrassing (as when he calls his ring-pierced son by thesame that the young man prefers), is a comic gem.  While I wasnot amused by a comment from a young man in the story,""Critics are the lowest form of the culture,"" the movie ispeppered by such bon mots as ""Sex is better than talking.  Justask anyone here.  Talking is what you have to suffer through toget to the sex."" Amen.     Woody Allen performs in the role of Val Waxman, who, likeMr. Allen himself, has passed the high point of his career, butunlike the director needs to succeed in making a new movie orhis career is over.  Val is still very much in love with his ex-wife,Ellie (played by the stunning Tea Leoni, who has the bearing ofHillary Clinton but is much better looking), but Ellie, fed updealing with her husband's hypochondria and adolescent needshas abandoned him to become engaged to the slick andhandsome Hal (Treat Williams).  Convincing Hal, the head of astudio, that he should bankroll his new work, ""The City ThatNever Sleeps"" with Val as director, she meets considerableopposition from the studio heads but ultimately, Hal agrees thatVal's the best man for this particular job.     Serious trouble arises when Val develops a psychosomaticcondition, hysterical blindness. Unable to see even from the firstday of the shoot, Val enlists the aid of his principal confidant, hisagent Al (Mark Rydell), determined to hide his condition lest hebe fired on the spot, his entire life's career down the tubes. Much of the laughter from this story, yet another film about themaking of a film, comes from Val's Fellini-esque attempts to fooleveryone into thinking that his eyesight is a sound as his vision.     Woody Allen has assembled a terrific cast in small roles,particularly Peter Gerety as the psychiatrist who discovers thecause of the blindness; Mark Rydell, who could pass for MelBrooks, as his trusted and loyal agent; and Mark Webber asVal's bandleader son Tony.  The part of Lori, who plays Val'sbimbo girlfriend in the relationship only to get a part in themovie is taken reasonably well by Debra Messing but MarisaTomei would have been the top choice hands down.     As further indication that art follows life, Val insists that aforeigner be selected as photographer for the movie ""The CityThat Never Sleeps,"" and lo, German cinematographer Wedigovon Schultzendorff has done a smashing job with ""HollywoodEnding,"" making New York look as magnificent as Tea Leoni,particularly in a scene of the city as dusk as the sun sinks belowthe great Manhattan skyline.  ""Hollywood Ending"" is an ode toNew York, Woody Allen's favorite city,  just the  film that couldrevive the tourist industry here in the Big Apple.  Given the titleof Mr. Allen's movie, who do you think winds up honeymooningwith Ellie: her ex-husband Val or her handsome and rich studiochief fiance Hal? ",Hollywood Ending,PG-13,2002,2
428,"Buddy cop movies are nothing new in the world of cinema; there areat least a dozen major ones each year, a middling few the least bitinterchangeable with the others. Usually, but not always, the pairingis of the odd couple variety, mixing different races and ethnicitiesto garner laughs (i.e. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan in the ""Rush Hour""series, or Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn in 2003's ""National Security"").  Directed by Ron Shelton (2003's ""Dark Blue""), ""Hollywood Homicide""is one of the smarter buddy cop flicks to come around in some time,if only because the comedy is slick and original and does not relyon the differing ages of 60-year-old Harrison Ford (2002's ""K-19:The Widowmaker"") and 24-year-old Josh Hartnett (2002's ""40 Days and40 Nights"") as the major source of its laughs. The conventions ofthe plot are still a little moldy around the edges, and some of thenarrative is needlessly complicated and muddled, but at its heartis a veritably delightful and likable duo that mesh surprisingly well with each other. Veteran Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) and rookie K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett)are LAPD homicide detectives working together on the double-murderof rap musicians in a trendy nightclub. Soon, the two deaths becomesfour as their apparent murderers are also found dead and burnt toa crisp. As Joe and K.C. dig further into the investigation, Joe findshimself warding off an unnecessary internal affairs inspection, whileaspiring actor K.C. struggles to rehearse for his lead role in a stageproduction of ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""  If a viewer is unsure whether ""Hollywood Homicide"" is a straight thrilleror a comedy, their query will be answered within the opening fiveminutes when Joe and K.C. seem more concerned with their hamburgerdressings than the crime scene they are working at. Written by RonShelton and Robert Souza, the film is sharp-witted and, on occasion,even zany, no less than during the climactic high-speed chase throughHollywood. As Joe and K.C. weave through traffic, come dangerouslyclose to getting severely injured, and ultimately crash their car,Joe desperately uses a child's bike (complete with decorative balloons)as his transportation, while K.C. hijacks a family's car and explainsthe nature of life and death to the sniveling children in the back-seat.Later, Joe, who works in real estate on the side, anxiously closesa deal on his cell phone as he chases a violent convict through an office building. For all of its clever asides and good-natured humor, ""Hollywood Homicide""is weakest when it is directly dealing with the particulars of itsstory. There are a few too many subplots that break off from the mainstoryline, confusing rather than enriching the narrative. And becauseit is learned by the viewer (but not by Joe and K.C.) who the killersare right from the beginning, it drains any sort of suspense or rootinginterest that might have been generated from the central investigation. Fortunately, the characters are more interesting and fun to watchthan the plot is, anyway. In a rare comedic role, Harrison Ford letsloose as the easy-going, terminally put-upon Joe Gavilan, garneringmany of the movie's biggest laughs with his sly comic delivery. Fordhasn't been this genuinely good in several years. As woman-magnetK.C. Calden, who dreams of quitting the police force and becominga full-time thespian, Josh Hartnett is a dynamite partner for Ford,so much more natural and winning than Paul Walker in this week's ""2Fast 2 Furious"" that it just goes to show a really fine young actorfrom a weak one. As Ford's psychic love interest, Lena Olin (2002's""Queen of the Damned"") is frisky and memorable in an underwritten part. ""Hollywood Homicide"" is an entertaining diversion, mostly due to HarrisonFord and Josh Hartnett's camaraderie and the comedic sincerity theybring to their roles. Meanwhile, the plot is expendable and the supportingactors (filled out with everyone from Martin Landau to Lolita Davidovichto rappers Master P and Kurupt to country singer Dwight Yoakam toLou Diamond Phillips as a drag queen) are colorful but wasted. Whatone is left with is a solid, undemanding experience that doesn't offermuch in the way of substance, but remains satisfying. You may notthink too much about ""Hollywood Homicide"" the second the end creditshave begun to roll, but you will not be able to deny the fun you had while it lasted.",Hollywood Homicide,PG-13,2003,1.5
429," This is not your usual boisterous, outrageous Eddie Murphycomedy - instead, it's a gentle contemporary fable about America'sshop-around-the-clock consumer mentality, starring Jeff Goldblum withMurphy in a supporting role. Goldblum plays a fast-talking,unscrupulous, self-absorbed executive at the Good Buy Network, aMiami-based home-shopping channel whose sales are plummeting when thevenal owner (Robert Loggia) brings in an Ivy League media analyst(Kelly Preston) to fix things. Goldblum makes a pass at Preston who istotally unresponsive until they inadvertently encounter a smiling,dashiki-clad pilgrim (Murphy) walking along the causeway. Prestonbefriends the beatific, self-styled holy man - who calls himself ""G"" -and Goldblum discovers G's got a natural aptitude for convincingpeople to listen to his spiritual platitudes. Soon G's on the air as aguru pitchman, mixing sermons with sales, hawking with Betty White,Morgan Fairchild, Soupy Sales, Willard Scott, and FlorenceHenderson. Profits soar and soon G's a hot commodity, entrancingeveryone. A rabbi claims he's talking from the Talmud, a Christianscholar insists he's invoking the New Testament, and an imam says he'sspeaking for the Muslims.

430,"      HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS is one of those bittersweet holiday comedicdramas.  In a fresh setup, we have a grownup single mom, Claudia (HollyHunter), reluctantly going back to stay with her parents forThanksgiving.  Hunter is a gifted actress most recently seen giving anexcellent performance in the great movie COPYCAT.       Claudia is down on her luck.  In the opening scene, her boss atthe art museum tells her, ""You're fired.  I had to.  We lost ninetypercent of our federal money.""  She then proceeds to lose her coat onthe way to what she envisions will be the Thanksgiving from hell.  Hersixteen year old daughter (Claire Danes) drives her to the airport andreinforces that notion by warning her, ""Check out what you have to lookforward to: cigarettes, junk food, and Gram's family stuffing.""  Herdaughter nonchalantly informs her as she is driving off that sheintends to sleep with her boyfriend while her mom is gone.  The movieseems to be saying, such is single motherhood in the 90s.       When Claudia arrives at the airport in Baltimore, her mom (AnneBancroft) and dad (Charles Durning) are there to greet her.  Actually,her mom seems to be there solely to offer a constant stream ofunsolicited advice.  Upon driving away, they get stuck in holidaytraffic.  Mom has a mile long cigarette stuck in Claudia's face most ofthe time while she lectures Claudia with such wisdom as ""I can see yourroots.""  The small car is an extremely confining and claustrophobic gaschamber for Claudia.  Don't feel too sad for her however becauseeventually everyone in the movie including Claudia ends up smoking likechimneys.  Hollywood continues to think that most Americans smoke andhave taken drugs, even if some of them have never inhaled.       Claudia's daughter told her to ""Float.  Just float"" like the angelfish when tense.  Claudia repeats this as a mantra while at herparents, but she also steaks off to her old bedroom to smoke pot.  Thisdrug usage was one of many unnecessary scenes in the picture.       The movie does not know what it wants to be.  In W. D. Richter'sscript, based on a Chris Radan short story, sometimes it is quitefunny.  Other well written lines are extremely poignant.  When talkingwith her uptight sister Joanne (Cynthia Stevenson), Claudia tells her,""You don't know the first thing about me.""  To which Joanne thinks andthen says, ""If I just met you on the street and you gave me yournumber, I'd throw it away.""  Claudia, visibly hurt, replies, ""We don'thave to like each other.  We're family.""       Against the all too infrequent laughter and well written seriousmoments, we have a lot of balderdash and sight gags - adults shootingeach other with water hoses and that sort of thing.  One of the starsof the show is Claudia's brother Tommy (Robert Downey, Jr.).  Downeygrates on your nerves with severe overacting.  He is a mercurial actorwho needs good directorial advice which director Jodie Foster neverprovided.  He is literally bouncing off of the walls in most scenes asif he was mainlining caffeine during breaks.  In one of the worstseries of scenes we have him constantly driving off burning rubber whenClaudia or his friend Leo (Dylan McDermott) try to get back in his oldhot rod of a car.       Second to the gratingly bad performance by Downey is that ofBancroft's.  She delivers a heavily cliched rendition of an overbearingmom.  Durning is okay playing a dad who seems sort of out of it.Although Stevenson has to be part of the disgustingly silly old joke ofa flying cooked turkey that falls in her lap, I thought she wasinteresting in a minor, one dimensional role.  Her banker husbandWalter (Steve Guttenberg) is given a part with no substance.  He getsto mouth only a few lines, e. g., ""Cash is King.  Cash is the fossilfuel that keeps our economic pistons pumping.""  It sounds funnier thanit is in the show.  There is also crazy Aunt Glady (Geraldine Chaplin)who wears Fruit Loops for a necklace and says one outlandish thingafter another.  Chaplin was fine with the part.       I am a big fan of Holly Hunter.  I though she was quite good in ahighly uneven movie.  The best scene is when she is at the door of herchildhood bedroom and is trying to figure out if she really wants tofend off an admirer or not.  She can do romance well if the directorswould just let her.  Too often they back off and have her cut to comedyas they did in BROADCAST NEWS.  I would have liked HOME FOR THEHOLIDAYS to have spent a lot more time on her romance.       I found myself constantly monitoring my watch wondering how muchmore of this I had to endure.  Every time Downey or Bancroft got in ascene, which is most of them, I thought, yuck, what next.  In fact, themovie is a series of labeled vignettes, and toward the end one isactually labeled ""What Next"".       There is a good movie contained within HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS whichI suppose is why most of the critics love this show.  For me, there areway too many failed sight gags and characters that got on my nerveswith their antics and mannerisms.  If Claudia's mom didn't leave heralone soon, I thought I was going scream.  The best part of this moviefor me was the ending.  Not that the ending is good, which it actuallyis, but that it finally came and I could go home. ",Home for the Holidays,PG-13,1995,1.5
431,"      Whereas there are good movies for teenagers and adults openingalmost every week, young kids have much less from which to choose.Most weeks bring nothing new and when they do, the movies frequentlyare written assuming the kids are morons, hence any script, no matterhow stupid, will suffice to attract the children to the show.  This wasone of those weeks when a kids' movie with some intelligence had itsdebut.       HOMEWARD BOUND II: LOST IN SAN FRANCISCO tells the continuing sagaof three animals.  The plot is nothing more than a recycled version ofthe first one, but hey, it is still funny and there are many greatlines.  Once again we have the rambunctious bulldog Chance (Michael J.Fox), the trusty old golden retriever Shadow (Ralph Waite since DonAmeche died), and the feisty, smart mouthed Himalayan cat Sassy (SallyField).       As the show starts, Chance tells us how great it is living withhis human family of Bob (Robert Hays), Laura (Kim Greist) and theirkids.  Chance says, ""They treat us pretty good here.  Three meals a dayand all the smelly sneakers you can eat.""  Right away you see that,hands down, the best part of the show is the script by Chris Hauty.The animals, other than Chance who is great, are not very emotive andfrequently their expressions seem to have little to do with the wordsthey speak but to which they do not move their lips.  The directing(David R. Ellis) is pretty lame, but the script and the voices save theday and create a delightful movie for children and the adults who arefortunate enough to get to join them.       The classic line of the show, which is also in the originalHOMEWARD BOUND, is when Chance tells Sassy in one of their many putdown lines to each other, ""Dogs rule and cats drool.""  Later she forceshim to say, ""Cats rule and dogs drool.""       This time, since the family is going from San Francisco to camp inCanada, they try to put the animals in the cargo hold of the airplane.The animals escape because they fear, incorrectly, that they are beingtaken to The Bad Place.  The movie is ostensibly about their attemptingto return and the family trying to find them, but actually it is mainlya series of incidents of two dogs and a cat meeting other dogs andcats.  No one seems too concerned about going home, and the humanshardly ever appear in the film.       Never mind, as an animals roam around a lot movie, it works,again, thanks solely to the dialog.  Sassy, whose name says it all,tells the dogs how to cope with, ""Does the cat always have to be thebrains of the operation?  Beauty and brains.  I never cease to amazemyself.""  When it rains, and she is forced to sleep with her caninecompanions, she is disgusted, telling the audience, ""Nothing smellsworse than wet dogs.""  Ever cocky Chance is unbowed by being lost,proclaiming, ""I welcome danger with open paws.""  He even breaks into arap rhythm with, ""I'm lost in the city with an optimistic dog and asarcastic kitty.""       Although the show is sweet, it is highly uneven.  There are longpassages with a bunch of animals just chatting.  This part ismonotonous and needed stronger editing by Peter E. Berger and MichaelA. Stevenson.  When we have sharp ripostes between Chance and Sassy,with fast cuts and a little action, the movie comes into its own.  Whenthe three of them get lost, Chance tells Sassy, ""Listen, we're guys.We don't stop and ask directions.  We know where we are every step ofthe way.""  When Chance meets a bad dog named Stinky, he tells him,""Hello Stinky, long time no smell.""  Finally, Chance is at his best inthe ending which wraps up the movie nicely.       HOMEWARD BOUND II runs only 1:29 and would have been a strongermovie with some of the slow scenes deleted.  It is correctly rated G.There is no sex, bad language or human nudity of any kind.  There is alittle violence in that the dogs do snarl at each other and kind ofwrestle around a bit plus there is a couple of scenes where it looksbriefly like there is the potential for harm.  This is all handled lowkey, and the movie did not seem to scare anyone in the theater.  Imissed the sense of purpose and direction that HOMEWARD BOUND had, butthe sequel is worth seeing for the continuing funny dialog that willdelight people of all ages.  It is not a particularly fast paced movie,so may bore some kids.  Jeffrey and his friend Allison, both almost 7,both loved it as did Allison's brother Josh (recently turned 4).  Irecommend the movie to you and give it ** 1/2. ",Homeward Bound II,G,1996,2.5
432,"Should ""Honey,"" the feature film debut of music video director Bille Woodruff, have been as painless and likable as it is? Fixing the mistakes of the similar 2001 bomb, ""Glitter"" (starting with an actress who can act circles around Mariah Carey), ""Honey"" is part slice-of-life drama about a hardworking New York City dancer named Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) who finds out the cost of success is more than she bargained for, and part hip-hop fairy tale where the said Honey is promoted from backup dancer to lead music video choreographer in a matter of about five minutes. It's all kind of inconsequential and silly when you stop to think about it for too long, but the use of realistic characters and relationships to tell what is essentially a music industry-set fantasy works surprisingly well. ""You can't have the future in hip-hop that you can have in ballet, "" Honey Daniels' concerned mother (Lonette McKee) tells her early on. But, no, ever since she was a child, 22-year-old Honey has had a dream to be a professional hip-hop dancer for big-time musicians. Working three jobs to make ends meet, including as a dance instructor for inner-city kids, Honey finally gets her chance to hit it big when music director Michael Ellis (David Moscow) spots her moves at a club and offers her work on his latest vi deo. Hit it big, she does, as Honey is promptly promoted to head choreographer on music videos for Tweet and Ginuwine. With success, however, comes expectations and pressures she is unsure she can handle. Without much time to work at the dance center anymore, Honey worries when one of her admiring students, Benny (Lil' Romeo), regresses into drug dealing. And when Michael expects Honey to repay him sexually and she turns him down, Honey suddenly finds herself looking at career suicide when her's hasn't even really begun yet. The key to the small-scale success of ""Honey"" lays with director Bille Woodruff and screenwriters Alonzo Brown and Kim Watson, who rarely go over-the-top or maudlin with the material. The story itself plays like little more than a young woman's idealistic wish fulfillment, but Woodruff, Brown, and Watson allow their characters and situations to flow smoothly and breathe. And there is a gentle sweetness and an attention to detail, too, such as when Honey say s goodnight to potential nice-guy suitor Chaz (Mekhi Phifer) and accidentally stumbles on the stairs in front of him. Also, watch closely at the way Honey tries to get through to Benny when she visits him in a detention center after he is caught selling drugs. She does not talk down to him, as an adult to a child, but treats him as an equal with a real shot to break free from the life of crime he is headed toward. In the protagonist of Honey, teenage audiences have an admirable role model; one that does not compromise her morals and beliefs to get ahead, and one that is free-thinking, intelligent, and driven. As Honey, Jessica Alba (1999's ""Idle Hands"") does not prove to be an exceptional actress, but she is a good one with further potential in future roles that might demand more of her. Alba is beautiful, to be sure, but when she speaks, you can tell that there is a mind to go along with her looks. Afte r garnering something of a cult following with her short-lived television series, ""Dark Angel,"" ""Honey"" may be Alba's deserved open door to movie stardom. She is worth following here, in a motion picture that blends all of the cliches of ""Flashdance,"" ""Save the Last Dance,"" and ""Coyote Ugly,"" so who knows what she could do with truly creative material. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, but the weaker participants don't hinder the film in any calamitous way. Lil' Romeo (2002's ""Like Mike"") shows off a little too much even for his smart alleck role of Benny, while David Moscow (2003's ""Just Married"" and the young Tom Hanks in 1988's ""Big""), as Michael Ellis, is just too good to be playing someon e without any redeeming qualities. Is it really necessary to always make the big music producer/director character in these movies a slimeball? Imagine how much more fresh this subplot might have been if Michael continued to believe in Honey even after she rejected his advances, seeing the error of his way in the process. Rounding out the major actors, Joy Bryant (2002's ""Antwone Fisher"") is amiably sassy and warm-hearted as Honey's best friend, Gina, while Mekhi Phifer (2001's ""O"") is fine, but underused as Honey's love interest, Chaz.",Honey,PG-13,2003,1.5

434," ""Hope Floats"" is a pretty good movie for a chick flick. Now, before you start yelling about sexism, read a little further. The term ""chick flick"" is used, often derisively, to describe a certain type of romantic movie. Aimed at female audiences, chick flicks are tearjerkers featuring noble women who suffer, usually due to an insensitive male or a horrible disease. When not busy agonizing or looking wistfully into the distance, the women bond with each other and learn important lessons about life. More often than not, chick flicks include one dance scene with a hunky guy, three angry confrontations where hurtful words are exchanged, a speech about forgiveness, and the death of at least one pivotal character. The films invariably end with our plucky heroine, bruised, but wiser, taking the first tentative steps into the next phase of her life.As anyone who has seen ""Field of Dreams"" or ""Good Will Hunting"" knows, there are male versions of chick flicks. In these, the main guy mopes around a lot while his buddies fret about him (in a very masculine way, of course.) After a few angry confrontations and lots of cussing or spitting, the leading man has an emotional breakthrough and hugs his father, or a father figure, while sobbing. Embarrassed but wiser, the guys exchange mock insults, then our hero takes the first tentative steps into the next phase of his life, while the men in the audience quickly dry their eyes before the lights come up.See, it all balances out. Everyone enjoys a good cry and there's nothing inherently wrong with either the male or female versions of chick flicks, as long as the material is handled well. Despite its downbeat storyline, ""Hope Floats"" works more often than not, thanks to Sandra Bullock's charisma and director Forest Whitaker's sense of style and attention to detail.The film begins on a Jerry Springer style talk show, where Bullock's character has come to receive a makeover. Instead, the na¥ve Chicago housewife is ambushed by her best friend and husband, who inform her that they are having an affair. Heartbroken and humiliated in front of a national audience, she packs up her daughter and heads home to Smithville, Texas, where she was once the Corn Queen.  The bulk of the film deals with adjustments, as Bullock licks her wounds and tries to figure out what to do next while dealing with her traumatized daughter, crusty mother and a handsome ex-schoolmate who has a crush on her.Sandra Bullock has laid low since her natural charm was snuffed in last years megabomb, ""Speed 2: Cruise Control,"" which even she conceded was a ""stinker."" Bullock doesn't have a great deal of range as an actor, but ""Hope Floats"" plays to her strengths and she comes off smelling like a rose. Harry Connick Jr., another actor with limited range, is well-cast as the resident studmuffin and young Mae Whitman does fine as Bullock's daughter. Playing the earthy Texas matriarch, Gena Rowlands has a number of effective scenes, although her character, who trots out ghoulish stuffed animals along with her homilies, is overly reminiscent of Barnard Hughes' taxidermist grandpa in ""The Lost Boys.""What keeps ""Hope Floats"" from playing like just another Lifetime Channel movie is Bullock's effervescence and Forest Whitaker's direction. Whitaker, one of America's finest actors, hit big as a director with ""Waiting To Exhale,"" and exhibits great assurance here, using imaginative camera work to add flair to the low-key storyline. Whitaker establishes an easygoing pace, then explores the details of this small town, from a playful lip-sync scene to a beautiful dissolve from a real landscape to the figures inside of a glass snow globe. He provides the film with a sense of grace that makes even the more mawkish scenes tolerable.The best moments in ""Hope Floats"" are the little ones; a showdown between the daughter and a pudgy school bully, a gentle, but frank discussion with a spiteful employment agent, and a very nice moment when Connick explains why he does woodworking as a hobby instead of a full-time job. ""You find something you love,"" he says, ""then you twist and turn it trying to find a way to make money from it. By the time you're finished, you can't even remember what it was you loved."" Thanks goodness that doesn't hold true to film criticism.In the vast realm of chick flicks, ""Hope Floats"" is a minor pleasure. Sure, it's no ""Terms of Endearment,"" but it's light years better than fare like ""A Thousand Acres."" Whitaker has crafted a film of small truths and lyrical moments. He's also given Sandra Bullock a chance to get her career back in motion. As long as she steers clear of cruise ships, she should do just fine. ",Hope Floats,PG-13,1998,2
435,"      Kneeling stoically in a field of tall grass, Robert Redford, ashorse whisperer Tom Booker, locks eyes with Pilgrim, a wild horse witha troubled past, who is a hundred yards away.  With Zen-like composure,Tom doesn't flinch as the hours drag on and the day begins to fade.  Asthe wide Montana skies turn a golden orange, he finally wins thislatest battle of wills with the horse.  With sagacity anddetermination, Tom has much to teach the equine and human characters inthis delicate drama.       Robert Redford, whose only Oscar was for his direction of thebrilliant and devastating ORDINARY PEOPLE from 1980, accepts thechallenge of directing himself in the starring role in THE HORSEWHISPERER.  Quite unlike what passes for drama today, THE HORSEWHISPERER contains deeply felt and complex emotions but withoutshouting or profanity.  Based on Nicholas Evans's best seller, thescript by Richard LaGravenese (A LITTLE PRINCESS) and Eric Roth(FORREST GUMP) is in no hurry to tell the story, which unfolds asnaturally as a mountain wildflower.  Coming in at just under threehours - Redford's first cut was close to four, the movie so mesmerizesyou that your only complaint is likely to be that you wish it werelonger.       The film starts with a horrible accident between two young teenagegirls on horseback and a large tractor-trailer truck.  The moviecenters around the two survivors; a girl named Grace MacLean, playedwith grace by Scarlett Johansson, and Pilgrim, played by six differentand incredibly talented horses.  Grace loses part of her leg, andPilgrim is so badly injured that the vet recommends ""putting him down.""       Grace is the daughter of hard-driving, Manhattan magazinepublisher Annie and ever-agreeable lawyer Robert.  Kristin ScottThomas, nominated for an Academy Award for her romantic role in THEENGLISH PATIENT, is the slowly metamorphosing Annie.  Starting out ascold as ice, she transforms into quite a different character.  AsRobert, character actor Sam Neill imbues the role with just the rightmixture of bland but genuine allegiance to his family.       After Kristen Scott Thomas reads in eloquent voice-over thedefinition of a horse whisperer, Annie calls up Tom in Montana to askhim to help Pilgrim.  ""Truth is, I help horses with people problems,""Tom explains to her.  He turns Annie down, which in her best businessdemeanor she refuses to accept.  ""Am I being too polite here?"" he asks.""Does 'no' in Montana mean 'yes' where you are?""       Soon Annie and a reluctant Grace are off with Pilgrim in tow,crossing the country in hopes of getting Tom to change his mind.  Thistrip gives Oscar winning cinematographer Robert Richardson (JFK) one ofmany opportunities to dazzle us with his exquisite work.  As they drivethrough farmland in the country's heartland, Richardson films them fromon high.  Their car cuts through the patchwork quilt of fields as thefilm's score hits one majestic note after another, all overlaid withthe chatter of their car radio picking up static-filled, localstations.  Richardson is even better with the close-ups than thesweeping vistas.  The intricate raindrops on the windshield are one ofthe many little treats he serves up for us.       ""Do they have any signs around here?"" Annie asks Grace.  ""Whatwould they say?"" Grace asks looking around at the lovely but remoteterrain.  ""10 miles to big rock.  20 miles to bigger rock.""       Although the script does have these occasional bits of humor, itis in the wisdom, in the character development and - yes, Redford fans- in the romance where it is most compelling.  With his ruggedlyhandsome face that speaks of many never-to-be-told mysteries, Redfordis an actor for every generation.  His little smile is guaranteed towin every heart in the audience in an instant.       The best of the story's simple, wisdom-filled scenes has Annie andTom reflecting on parts of their lives.  Annie says she envies Tom'selderly mother, who is at an age in which she has no more decisions tomake and in which she can savor the good decisions in her life as wellas the bad ones.  During this soul bearing Annie asks Tom how he knewthat his long-since divorced wife was not right for him.  ""Knowing itis the easy part,"" he tells her.  ""Saying it out loud is the hardpart.""       I fell head over heels in love with this powerful but subtlemovie.  And audiences may again become infatuated with the 61-year-oldRedford, proving that age makes no difference when it comes to love.       THE HORSE WHISPERER runs 2:44.  It is rated PG-13 for onedisturbing accident scene and would be fine for kids around 10 and up. ","Horse Whisperer, The",PG-13,1998,3
436,"While one may be funnier than the other, or more memorable, anyonewalking into a Rob Schneider vehicle should have the sense to knowwhat to expect. Based on quality and the overall laugh quotient, ""TheHot Chick"" places squarely in between 1999's hugely entertaining ""DeuceBigalow: Male Gigolo"" and 2001's mediocre ""The Animal."" It is an admittedlyby-the-numbers affair, but garners some hearty and unexpected laughsthrough the machinations of its premise.  Written and directed by Tom Brady and co-written by Schneider, thefilm is the latest in a long line of body-switching comedies, in whichcharacters take on the physicality of someone else through some sortof mystical occurrence. In this case, the victims are snooty highschool princess Jessica (Rachel McAdams) and grubby crook Clive (RobSchneider), and the switcheroo occurs when each puts in a matchingearring dating back to 50 B.C. When Jessica wakes up in Clive's body,she is understandably freaked out by the added hair, new private parts,and thirtyish appearance. Jessica is aided in her desperate questto reverse the spell by her longtime best friend, April (Anna Faris),all the while realizing what a conceited person she used to be, andsetting out to make things right for everyone whose life she made miserable. The opening twenty minutes of ""The Hot Chick"" are unpromising, atbest, setting up a disposably empty, teen-targeted yarn filled withgrating, mean-spirited characters. Once the body-switch comes intoeffect, the pacing and amusement gradually improve until a well-meaningand rather sweet conclusion takes over. For each awkwardly over-the-topbit (an innocent sleepover pillow fight turns into a WWF Smackdownwhen Jessica uses her newfound muscles on her friends), there is ajoke that does succeed (Jessica's predicament of using a public urinalfor the first time). At its center is a valuable, if simplistic, moral,and three characters who become endearing (Jessica, Jessica in Clive's body, and April).  When the movie is happy to just be dumb fun, it takes off best ofall. A subplot involving Jessica's African-American friend, Keecia(Maritza Murray), who is embarrassed by her positively smotheringAsian mother (Jodi Long), is uproarious, while topical jabs at WinonaRyder and child-molesting priests are surprisingly ballsy. An extendedcameo from Adam Sandler (2002's ""Eight Crazy Nights"") as a potheadantique seller is also less obvious than expected, while the standoutturn from Jodi Long (1993's ""Striking Distance"") is not to be missed. Introducing a possible semi-lesbian romance between Jessica (in Clive'sbody) and April is provocative, but doesn't have the courage to followthrough in a satisfying manner. The same thing goes for the relationshipbetween Jessica and her devoted boyfriend, Billy (Matthew Lawrence),whom she has trouble confessing her gender-bending secret to. Meanwhile,Jessica's kid brother, nicknamed Booger (Matt Weinberg), spends hisdays cross-dressing. The undercurrents of homosexuality running throughout""The Hot Chick"" are not always handled as honestly as they could be,but it is amazing that they are there at all in such a commerciallyviable, youth-oriented flick. Rob Schneider is a genuine comic talent, and plays Jessica as a sympatheticand girlish young woman with real intelligence hiding behind her temporarilyhairy, manly exterior. Schneider could have gone for the cliched versionof what a teenage girl acts like, and at times does, but often optsfor building depth within the character. In her first major featurefilm role, Rachel McAdams is a definite find, who plays three separatecharacters, each building multiple dimensions with not much screentime (stuck-up Jessica at the onset, a wiser Jessica at the end, andthe unkempt, criminal Clive). And Anna Faris (2000's ""Scary Movie""and 2001's ""Scary Movie 2"") shines as steadfast, loving best friendApril, evoking the comic timing of a pro and the giddy naturalism of a star. For all of its themes and moralistic points, at heart ""The Hot Chick""is an inconsequential trifle. Director Tom Brady makes sure neverto get too serious or too deep for too long. His central goal is nothingmore than to deliver a fun movie to the target demographic of 13 to22-year-olds, and that is fulfilled by the end with a lot of heartand a reasonable handful of solid laughs. ""The Hot Chick"" is no morethan just that, but, sometimes, that's enough.","Hot Chick, The",PG-13,2002,2
437,"    Shortly into Stephen Daldry's ""The Hours,"" adapted from thenovel by Michael Cunningham by the great English playwrightDavid Hare, I felt like sending out the Drumline folks with ChristinaRicci and Kirsten Dunst to lead the cheers...""What do we want?Happiness!  When do we want it?  Now!   ""The Hours,"" whichcunningly weaves three separate stories about three women'sactivities during the course of a single day, shows its principalcharacters in various stages of depression.  Unfortunately themovie can reinforce the belief by some in the audience who donot distance themselves enough to see the three as literaryfigures connected in some way to Virginia Woolf's novel ""Mrs.Dalloway"" that quite a large number of women suffer fromhormonal imbalances peculiar to the female gender: PMS, forexample.  A more studied look would reveal the three to bedepressed for a variety of reasons, reasons that could put us meninto a funk as well: and may we anticipate a sequel that wouldhone in on us males, the weaker sex?     Daldry faces an additional challenge: the women are fromdifferent eras in distinctly varied locations..  How to show that themore times change, the more they remain the same?  Just watch,as ""The Hours"" explores, well, hours, in the lives of women from England in 1923, Los Angeles in 1951 and The Big Apple, 2001.     The film is framed by an event that actually occurred in 1941 inSussex, England, where world-famous writer Virginia Woolfpopped a large stone into her coat pocket, walked withdetermination into the local lake, and drowned herself.  As elicitedby the dialogue between Ms. Woolf (Nicole Kidman) and herhusband Leonard Woolf (Stephen Dillane), Virginia has a historyof hearing voices, blacking out, and feeling down down down tosuch an extent that Leonard moves the family from London to thesticks of Richmond. This ironically worsenes her condition, as avisit from her big-city sister Vanessa (Miranda Richardson) withthree active kids in tow makes her realize what she misses byhaving left her urban life.  Similarly suicidal, Laura Brown (JulianneMoore), living in L.A. with her stolid husband Dan Brown (John C.,Reilly) and their six-year-old Richie (Jack Rovello), feels terriblebecause Dan Brown does not look like Viggo Mortensen, bakingcakes for her husband's birthday somehow does not fulfill her tothe core, and the novel she's been reading, ""Mrs. Dalloway"" byVirginia Woolf, gives her some funny ideas..  Clarissa Vaughan'sfunk is the most incomprehensible.  Stopping by daily to takecare of Richard Brown (Ed Harris), a poet who is dying of AIDSand does not feel particularly cheerful about that (and whohappens to have been the six-year-old son of Laura Brown),Clarissa simply realizes that she had much more fun a decadeearlier when she and Louis Waters (Jeff Daniels) were lovers. Louis, by the way, became the lover of Richard Brown but more orless abandoned him when Richard developed full-blown AIDS.     So you see, we're all connected.  Virginia Woolf starts the cycleof history, Laura Brown reads her novel, and Clarissa Vaughantakes care of the son of the woman who read the novel., Photographer Seamus McGarvey captures the spirit of each era,setting the 1920s in sepia while the innocent fifties almost breaksinto the pastel colors of ""Far from Hollywood.""  Peter Boyle editssharply, moving freely from one decade to the other, allowingeveryone in the audience to see clearly how the women arepsychologically bound with one another. For example, whenVirginia is lying on her side, Boyle cuts into Laura, who isreposing in the same manner.     And oh yes, there is a lesbian motif, as the frustrated Virginiakisses her sister Vanessa on the lips while little Richard watchesin awe; the cake-baking Laura puckers up for her sister, Kitty(Toni Collette); then, we are not surprised to watch a littleintimacy between the contemporary Clarissa with her live-ingirlfriend, Sally Lester (Allison Janney).  One distinguished onlinecritic faulted the film largely because in his view the lesbianism isdated as a theme, making this in his estimation the sort of storythat would attract tourist busses from Virginia crammed withwomen who would show up at the box office in a desperateattempt to become shocked.  I see the lesbian theme as minor,though, the real story being a psychological exploration of womenfrom different decades who share perpetual feelings of doom andgloom.     Ultimately, the story is much ado about nothing.  What is funnyin watching Woody Allen give in to his neuroses and Nicolas Cage(in ""Adaptation"") opening his film comically with profound self-doubts is treated in a serious fashion here, but the whole projectis literary more than cinematic.  We do get into the heads of thecharacters, but Michael Cunningham's novel, which I have notread, is probably the better way to absorb this tale of trouble.     The make-up is astonishing.  Does anyone doubt that PaulEngelen, who made Ms. Kidman actually plain by fitting her withConor O'Sullivan and Jo Allen's prosthetic nose; and Kerry Warnwho gives Ms. Kidman a hair style that almost makes youunderstand why Woolf is depressed, are Oscar-bound for theirparticular talents?  Ditto for Elaine Offers, who ages JulianneMoore fifty years with just the right assortment of wrinkles to saynothing of Philip Glass's eerie, signature music, which moves theplot right along.     ""The Hours"" won ""Best Picture"" from the National Board ofReview, which is a stretch, but who wants to argue personaltaste?  ""The Hours"" is a tribute to the unseen people in the crew,the aforementioned make-up artists, who assure us that whilepeople do not change deep down, they can project wildly differentsurfaces.  Now which of these backstage geniuses wants to turnme into Tom Cruise? ","Hours, The",PG-13,2002,3
438,"Based on the best-selling 1999 novel by Andre Dubus III, ""House ofSand and Fog"" is a stark, unflinching dual character study in whichboth subjects are treated as severely flawed people. All fine andsimple, but what is so very arresting about Vadim Perelman's auspiciousdirecting debut is that he presents these two human beings as fullyfleshed out individuals. Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly) and MassoudAmir Behrani (Ben Kingsley) may make the wrong decisions, some ofwhich have negative life-altering effects on themselves a nd thosearound them, but they also have the power to feel compassion and,in turn, become sympathetic to the viewer. It's a good thing, too,because neither Kathy nor Behrani is going to get out of their dire predicament easily.  Kathy Nicolo, a former drug addict still ailing from the breakup withher husband eight months ago, is distressed when she is evicted fromher Northern California seaside house over an unpaid business taxthat was mistakenly billed to her. While such a snafu might have beencleared up had she not neglected opening her mail, Kathy knows noway around it and suddenly loses the home that she grew up in andthat was left to her by her deceased father.  Sweeping in to purchase the property with astonishing quickness isMassoud Amie Behrani, an Iranian immigrant who moved to the UnitedStates years ago and has since been working multiple jobs in orderto keep up his appearance and satisfy his wife, Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo),and teenage son, Esmail ( Jonathan Ahdout). Behrani's planto raisethe house's asking price and make a tidy profitgoes awry when, indesperation, Kathy tries to bargain with him herself and make himsee that the house was unfairly stolen from her. When Behrani refusesto see the matter as his own problem, Kathy and new police officerboyfriend Lester Burton (Ron Eldard) progressively get deeper anddeeper in over their heads. Before long, there is nowhere for anyoneinvolved to go but down.  ""House of Sand and Fog"" is notable for being both a drama and a psychologicalthriller that might have come off as trite in lesser hands, but avoidsthese trappings by realistically concentrating on the people involved.For Kathy, an unhappy woman with not much going for her, her houseis the only connection she has to the American Dream. When it is takenaway and she no longer has the money for a place to live, Kathy findsherself on a self-destructive path. Jennifer Connelly (2003's ""TheHulk"") is remarkable as the emotionally shattered Kathy, breathingpoignancy and desperation into a complex role. Kathy's problems wouldnever have occurred had she been more responsible, yes, but otherwiseit is the government's error and she has done nothing wrong. Connellymakes this conundrum palpably felt.  For a long time, Behrani is unlikable, both because he has a bad tempertoward his beloved family and because it is so clear that, althoughlegal, what he refuses to do for Kathy is out of purely selfish reasons.When a key moment comes in the third act, however, Behrani provesthat he is capable of true empathy. Unfortunately, his change of heartmay have come too late. Ben Kingsley (2002's ""Tuck Everlasting""),like his Behrani, comes into his own near the end and sheds new lighton him. When this arrives, Kingsley is nothing short of mesmerizing.  As Behrani's caring, but doubting, wife, Nadi, Shohreh Aghdashloomemorably brings multiple layers to her own part. Nadi loves her husband,but she is intentionally kept out of the loop on what is going onbetween Behrani and Kathy. Because of this, she fears for her family'sfuture and isn't sure who she can trust. The underrated Ron Eldard(2002's ""Ghost Ship"") also turns in a fine performance as the intriguingLester Burton, who joins Kathy on her crusade and is willing to giveup his entire family to be with her. Even as Lester starts caringfor Kathy and her plight, he somehow also derives pleasure from seeingher fall off the wagon of her sobriety. It is as if, without his children,he needs someone to need him, and he chooses Kathy as his victim.  Evocatively photographed by Roger Deakins (2003's ""Intolerable Cruelty""),who gives the brooding on-location scenery of the Northern Californiacoast a life of its own, ""House of Sand and Fog"" refuses to offersimple solutions and easy answers. In building its premise and characters,director Vadim Perelman takes his time before things become so intenseand unpredictable that claustrophobia threatens to set in. The amazinglydownbeat conclusion, which features an unforgettable symbolic imagesof three people on a bed, is certainly effective on its own, but doesn'tquite succeed amid the bigger picture. Nothing is really solved bythe time the end credits arrive, and Kathy's character arc is leftwide open. It's distracting and mildly unsatisfying, but then thatmay be the whole point. For viewers courageous enough to withstandthe bleakest of stories and the most cynical of outcomes, ""House ofSand and Fog"" is a challenging motion picture that deeply enthrallsfor the whole of its two hours.",House Of Sand and Fog,R,2003,3.5
439,"      ""Oh my God, I sounded just like a mother!"" Mrs. Pascal, playedwith devilish wickedness by Genevieve Bujold, tells her son.  ""Didn't Isound just like a mother?""  ""You are a mother,"" her son Marty tells herdisgustedly.  ""I know, but I still can't believe it.  I look at youpeople and wonder, how did you ever fit in my womb?""       Marty, you see, is a grown-up twin.  Although his sister, whothinks she is Jackie-O, is certifiably insane, Marty fits right in withthe rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedyTHE HOUSE OF YES.       Mother and daughter, played in a brilliant performance by ParkerPosey, are both varying degrees of wacko.  Most dysfunctional familiesin the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolicallyabnormal as this one is.  The daughter's fantasy of being Jackie-O isprobably the most sane part of her being.  Mrs. Pascal is the sort thatwill not let Jackie-O keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept onthat level.  She explains to Marty's new fiancee, Lesly (ToriSpelling), soon after their first meeting that Jackie-O was holdingMarty's private part when she came out of the womb.       The dialog by Wendy MacLeod, based on the play by Mark Waters, isso sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through thecelluloid at any moment.  The script, reminiscent of a David Mametplay, flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizingset of bizarre characters.  The exaggerated setup has Lesly and Martyarriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a ThanksgivingDay hurricane.       In this storm are two sane individuals.  The fiancee is a giddy,school-girl type, embarrassed by everything, a complete contrast to herrival Jackie-O's bitter pseudo-sophistication.  As the two twins'younger brother, Anthony, Freddie Prinze Jr. plays the All-America boytype whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding hisbrother's fiancee that night.       ""We all have our secrets,"" Jackie-O tells her potentialsister-in-law, and boy, does she have a few.  This is a house filledwith them.  (When Lesly calls it the family's ""home"" to Mrs. Pascal --they've never had a visitor before Lesly -- Mrs. Pascal becomesdiscombobulated until she realizes that Lesly is talking about their""house."")       In a film that gives new meaning to the phrase, ""made for eachother,"" the twin's biggest, but not their only secret, is that they'vehad a long-term incestuous relationship.  They don't like to discussit, although they are not particularly ashamed of it.  Perfect forviewers who can appreciate perverse comedy, this story never pulls itspunches.       Jackie-O tries in many ways, few subtle, to show that she is abetter match for Marty than that ditzy fiancee of his.  In one sceneMarty and Lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano whenJackie-O pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classicalpiece for four hands.  Marty joins her as his fiancee looks on withenvy.       The chemistry between Parker Posey and Josh Hamilton is nothingshort of amazing.  They put down their little brother and most of theother sane people in the world.  Their ripostes are engaging filmmakingat its best.  Director Mark Waters keeps the show's energy level highand lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace.  Hiscrisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it.       Jackie-O is temperamentally incapable of being nice.  And beingjealous, she cuts Lesly down mercilessly.  ""Were you poor?"" Jackie-Oasks her when she finds that Lesly committed the crime of growing upimpoverished.  ""Did you eat pies?  Chicken pot pies?""  ""Pancakesactually, lots of pancakes,"" Lesly replies with her usual sincerity.       ""A Donut King, so is she like the queen?,"" Jackie-O cattilyinquires of Marty when she learns that Lesly works at a Donut King.""Are we entertaining royalty?""       With Rolfe Kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clearwhere the story is headed.  Will it end in a big emotional explosion, amurder, people slowly cutting each other up with words, a familialcatharsis, a weather disaster or what?  The emotionally charged play isclearly going somewhere, and the engaging characters captivate theaudience with their spell.  I'll not say more except that the ending isperfect and a bit of a surprise.       THE HOUSE OF YES runs a blazing fast 1:25.  It is rated R forsexual situations and conversations, mature themes, violent overtonesand some profanity.

In my packed audience ofcollege-aged students and younger, they identified with every joke, whichwas quite scary.  I felt like I did at my first Adam Sandler screening,completely out of place.  Every time the audience was roaring, I wasgroaning.   Even if you can get completely past the appropriateness of the movie'smorals, or actually lack thereof, the film itself is pretty pathetic.

About asoriginal as the movie ever gets is an exploding pigeon poop episode. The plot concerns two stoners, Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman), whoget perfect test scores on their college board THCs, thanks to the help of astoner ghost.  Since they can choose any college they want, they pickHarvard, giving the movie's plot some superficial similarities to thebrilliantly written and acted LEGALLY BLONDE.  But, trust me.  HOW HIGH isno LEGALLY BLONDE. HOW HIGH, which might be thought of as a Cheech and Chong movie for thisgeneration, does have a couple of good moments.  My favorite is theperformance by Spalding Gray.  He plays a self-loathing white liberal whoteaches Black Studies.  A genuine masochist, the professor is never happierthan when Silas and Jamal heap verbal abuse on him in class. HOW HIGH runs about an hour and a half.

441,"""How to Deal"" could be considered a thinking-person's entry into theteen genre, in that there isn't a bet in sight or a climactic sceneset at the prom. It does, however, give ""Terms of Endearment"" a runfor its money. Marriage, divorce, pregnancy, death, car accidents--theyall make an appearance in a story that often wavers dangerously closeto feeling overstuffed and contrived, but is saved by a decidedlysmart and accurate portrayal of each subject. Of course, such a thingmay happen when a motion picture is based on two separate novels,""Someone Like You"" and ""That Summer,"" by Sara Dessen. Attempting tocram two books' worth of plot material into a 100-minute movie isnot a very good idea, but ""How to Deal"" squeaks by with astute writing(credited to Neena Beber) and effectively well-rounded performances from its ensemble. 16-year-old Halley Martin (Mandy Moore) has never been in love, anddoesn't much want to be. Having witnessed her parent's divorce, herdad's (Peter Gallagher) quick recoupling with a much-younger woman,and her best friend, Scarlett's (Alexandra Holden), suffering afterher beloved boyfriend's sudden death, Halley has become jaded andcynical on all things romantic. Out to change her ways and help herto discover that true love is possible is the sincere and handsomeMacon (Trent Ford), a classmate whom she feels connected with. Meanwhile,Halley's older sister, Ashley (Mary Catherine Garrison), begins makingplans for her own wedding, while her unhappy mother (Allison Janney)unexpectedly finds a soul mate where she least expects one. Directed by Clare Kilner, ""How to Deal"" is a slice-of-life drama moreserious than most of its teen film counterparts. The aforementionedsubjects it deals with are very real ones and handled with a minimumof mawkishness, even if the sheer amount of them that occur in thefilm's timeframe of less than one year is slightly convoluted. Thepicture, then, benefits from lacking a simple and frivolous plot thatcan be summed up in a sentence.  At its center is a strong and complex lead character who has actualbeliefs and morals that she refuses to compromise for anyone. In onlyher second leading role (after 2002's ""A Walk to Remember""), singerMandy Moore has developed into a mature and natural actress, an undeniablyinstinctive talent who could easily have a long and successful filmcareer if she so wishes. Moore makes the character of Halley her own,quite a feat for someone who was trained more as a music performer than an acting one. Giving sharp-eyed support are Allison Janney (2002's ""The Hours""),hitting all the right notes with her usual alternating brand of poignancyand comic intuition as Halley's mother; Alexandra Holden (2002's ""TheHot Chick""), as Scarlett, making the most of a role than unfortunatelydecreases in screentime as the film progresses; the classy Nina Foch(2002's ""Pumpkin""), very funny as Halley's pot-smoking grandmother;and Mary Catherine Garrison (2002's ""Moonlight Mile""), excellent asHalley's close sister, Ashley. It should also be noted Garrison moreplausibly portrays inebriation with more accuracy than I can rememberseeing outside of a documentary on the subject.  In his first major role, Trent Ford (2001's ""Gosford Park"") standsout as Halley's love interest, Macon, precisely because he makes theviewer feel as if they have known people exactly like him in theirown lives. Ford is good-looking, but not classically handsome; heis tall and lanky, with too-long hair that is always sweeping overhis eyes. At the same time, he makes a valid attempt to really listento Halley, making it easy to see why she would fall for him, and justas easy to understand why Halley would be hurt when his teenage immaturityleads him to a bad judgment call. As good as Ford is, it is the lovestory between he and Moore that is the weakest subplot in a moviefilled with rich character work. Simply put, this sort of rocky romancethat inevitably ends happily has been seen countless times before,and carried out with more conviction.  ""How to Deal"" benefits more often than not by taking the road lesstraveled in teen films, where more emphasis is put on the charactersthan an easy plot synopsis. Director Clare Kilner refuses to condescendto her target audience, offering something that adults may be ableto enjoy just as much as teens. Because of this, when the movie makesa misstep, such as a silly and over-ironic development in the thirdact, it is all the more disappointing. ""How to Deal"" is an ambitiouscoming-of-age film, less predictable than most, with a sparkling turnby Mandy Moore. Unfortunately, as in life, it is far from perfect.",How To Deal,PG-13,2003,2
442,"Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is a cute, talented journalist for thepopular women's magazine, ""Exposure,"" who writes monthly ""How To""columns. Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is a handsome lifelongbachelor struggling to get his ideas heard at his advertising job.When Andie concocts her latest column, ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,""in which she will initially attract a man and then purposefully makethe mistakes women often make in relationships, she chooses Benjaminas her target. What she doesn't realize is that Benjamin has madehis own bet: if he can make a woman fall head over heels in love withhim in ten days, he will finally be allowed to pitch his advertisingideas to the head of a diamond company. With Andie secretly attemptingto turn off Benjamin for her assignment, and Benjamin determined tomake her fall for him, an unsaid battle forms that leaves both partiesunavoidably attracted to the other, and wondering if they haven'tmade a terrible mistake in th! eir initial schemes. Directed by Donald Petrie (2000's ""Miss Congeniality""), ""How to Losea Guy in 10 Days"" would seemingly have all of the ingredients neededto make a charming romantic comedy, including the well-cast pairingof lovable star-on-the-rise Kate Hudson (2000's ""Almost Famous"") andthe equally able Matthew McConaughey (2002's ""Frailty""), but it takestoo many wrong turns on its path for the inevitable happy ending. For a while, it seems as if Hudson's Andie and McConaughey's Benjaminhave been written as unusually intelligent individuals for this typeof mainstream romance, but the screenplay (by Kristen Buckley, BrianRegan, and Burr Steers) lets them down in the end. The climax, setat the gala reception for the diamond company Benjamin wants to pitchhis ideas to, dissolves into a disheartening series of revelationsand misunderstandings. The way in which Andie and Benjamin handletheir mutual discovery of what each has been doing to the other isterribly frustrating, as their IQ levels are knocked down severalnotches and they come off seeming needlessly selfish.  To all individuals with at least part of their brains working: ifyou were playing a trick on someone, and then you found out that theother was doing the exact same thing, wouldn't you laugh it off andget on with your life? For Andie and Benjamin, they become irate ateach other, causing an on-stage charade at the reception and thencontinuing their one-sided argument outside. Sure, both of them finallycome around, but this kind of dumbed-down plot development makes theleads look bad and the audience feeling messed around with. Lest it seem like the film is a complete bust, ""How to Lose a Guyin 10 Days"" does have its sharp moments. The lengths in which Andiegoes to in her desperate quest to scare off Benjamin is quite funny,as she tricks him into taking her to a Celine Dion concert, raidshis weekly poker game with his buddies, and digitally superimposestheir faces to make a family photo album, complete with fantasy children.As they reluctantly start to really like each other, there are quitea few engagingly sweet and romantic scenes, to boot, helped immeasurablyby the chemistry Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey ignite. For Hudson, this is her first big lead role, and she is fabulous asAndie even when the screenplay lets her down. Repeating a characterquite similar to the one he played in 2001's dreadful ""The WeddingPlanner,"" McConaughey's role as Benjamin is undemanding, but he doesit with effortless skill. In supporting roles, Kathryn Hahn (TV'sCrossing Jordan"") is a bright new face as Andie's best friend; AdamGoldberg (2001's ""A Beautiful Mind""), in a role way below his provenabilities, is Benjamin's best friend; and Bebe Neuwirth (1999's ""Summerof Sam"") has the thankless part of Andie's stringent boss. Since the minor roles are just that--minor--this is Kate Hudson andMatthew McConaughey's show all the way, and they carry the film asfar as they can on their own before the ill-conceived third act bringsthem to a road block they don't recover from. ""How to Lose a Guy in10 Days"" is an entertaining trifle to a point (complete with a poppy,catchy soundtrack), but it doesn't treat the character's or the audience'sintelligence with the respect they deserve. By the end, you just don't care anymore.",How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days,PG-13,2003,2.5
443,"Based on the Marvel comic book by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, ""Hulk""comes equipped with an unusually strong and independent-minded pedigree.The director is Ang Lee, he of such art-house hits as 1997's ""TheIce Storm"" and 2000's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" The cast includesrecent Australian newcomer Eric Bana (2001's ""Black Hawk Down"") andAcademy Award winner Jennifer Connelly (2001's ""A Beautiful Mind"")as a pair of scientists/ex-lovers, and Nick Nolte (1998's ""The ThinRed Line"") and Sam Elliott (2002's ""We Were Soldiers"") as their authoritative,domineering fathers. And the film as a whole depends more on its nuanced,multilayered story and troubled characters than on mindless actionsequences and overblown special effects. Yes, it's safe to say ""Hulk""is not your garden-variety comic book adaptation. What ""Hulk"" does achieve is a fond and unrivaled faithfulness to itscomic book roots. With complex, swirling camera movements, courtesyof cinematographer Frederick Elmes (2002's ""Trapped""), and knowledgeablyflashy editing by Tim Squyres (2001's ""Gosford Park"") that uses splitscreens and scene transitions to their fullest advantage, the filmis a visual feast. Not only is there so much to take in with youreyes that a second viewing is imperative, but ""Hulk"" stands out asthe closest any motion picture has come to a comic book sprung to life. ""Hulk"" is ponderous and takes its time in revealing its story threadsand true character shades--a rarity in summer blockbusters. Althoughthere are awe-inspiring, edge-of-your-seat set-pieces (mostly in thelast hour of the 138-minute running time) and some stunningly realisticCG effects to be had, action-hungry moviegoers may honestly not knowwhat to make of Ang Lee's filmmaking approach and John Turman, MichaelFrance, and James Schamus' wordy, adult-minded screenplay. ImagineBrian De Palma, David Lynch, and Alex Proyas joining forces on anoperatic tragedy, and the results may come relatively close to thedemanding but enriching experience ""Hulk"" ultimately delivers. In a prologue set in 1966, a young Bruce Banner witnesses a traumaticchildhood experience involving his caring mother and psychotic militaryscientist father. In the present day, Bruce has followed in the footstepsof his long-lost father and become a scientist at the Berkeley NuclearBiotechnical Institute. Working alongside his ex-girlfriend, BettyRoss (Jennifer Connelly), Bruce's latest project involves subjectinglab animals to radiation and gamma rays in an attempt to enlarge and strengthen them.  When Bruce is accidentally exposed to the radiation himself, it uncoverssomething that has always been simmering underneath his surface: arage that transforms him into the Hulk--a green-skinned, 15-foot monstrositywith a strength and invincibility unsurpassed by any other livingorganisms. As the military closes in on the Hulk, Betty must cometo terms with her tender feelings for Bruce and an unspoken bond thathas left both parties little more than emotionally wounded children--shewith her cold father, General Ross (Sam Elliott), who wants to harmthe Hulk, and Bruce with his unhinged dad, David Banner (Nick Nolte),who is partially accountable for his son's burden as the Hulk. ""Hulk"" is as ambitious as any of the recent Marvel comic adaptations(2002's ""Spider-Man,"" 2003's ""Daredevil,"" 2003's ""X2""), if only becauseit may require multiple viewings simply to catch and understand everythinggoing on with the characters and premise. This is not to say that""Hulk"" is incomprehensible, because it definitely isn't; it simplyrequires more concentration and thought than your average visual effectsextravaganza. The movie is not cheerful and lightweight, but darkand downbeat, filled with hurtful childhood wounds and repressed memories. The outcome of Ang Lee's courageous cinematic treatment of ""Hulk,""a potentially lucrative franchise, is not always completely successful,but nothing less than admirable. A climactic face-off between Bruceand David is overly stagy and overacted by an otherwise effectiveNick Nolte, and the overall atmospheric mood occasionally threatensto drown the picture's entertainment value. Because Bruce (as theHulk) is not so much a superhero as a badly-tempered giant who uncontrollablydestroys stuff, a rooting interest in his fate is not as strong asit should be. Still, while the film may not be what some viewers areexpecting and, therefore, may turn them off, one cannot deny the sheeraspiration and scope of what director Lee has attempted. A sequenceinvolving three mutated dogs is utterly thrilling and devilishly mischievous,and the whole San Francisco/desert finale is exhilarating on a viscerallevel while never losing sight of its purpose. Above all, ""Hulk"" is intelligently written and conceived, filled withsuch innovation and keen detail that it is more than worth closerinspection and further viewings. Eric Bana is acceptable in the difficultrole of Bruce Banner, while Jennifer Connelly turns in another passionateand believable performance as the strong-willed but confused BettyRoss. ""Hulk"" may not be as purely fun as ""Spider-Man,"" but Ang Leeshould be commended for putting a whole lot at stake with this project:a robust budget, technically advanced and intricate effects, and astory and characters more complicated and developed than what oneis used to seeing within this genre. For what it attempts to achieveand more often than not does, ""Hulk"" is an unconventional, ballsy winner.","Hulk, The",PG-13,2003,3

What the Deans of Massachusetts' Athens College failto realizeand Coleman chooses not to divulgeis a secret he has kepthis whole life that, were it put out in the open, would have saved his job. Thus begins ""The Human Stain,"" based on the novel by Philip Roth anddirected by Robert Benton (1998's ""Twilight""), an involving, multilayereddrama that improves as it marches toward its effective conclusion,but is burdened by its all-too-obvious ploy to be Miramax's next bigOscar contender. The film simply tries too hard to be ""serious"" cinema,coming off over-the-top at times because of it, but the performancesare strong and its fluid interweaving of the past and present is largely effective. Jobless and having recently lost his wife, Iris (Phyllis Newman),a second chance at happiness and love enters Coleman's dwindling lifein the form of 34-year-old Faunia (Nicole Kidman), a troubled butbewitching university janitor harboring a dark secret of her own.Coleman's sees Faunia as his chance for salvation, but, for reasonsthat gradually unveil themselves, Faunia is hesitant to get too closeto anyone. Their hesitant relationship, bubbling with passion andeventually love, leads them toward a fatalistic event that would seemtragic if not for the cathartic connection they have made with each other. ""The Human Stain"" is a severely flawed motion picture, but managesto rise above its low points and make an indelible emotional impact.The narration, given by Coleman's writer friend, Nathan (Gary Sinise),is unnecessary and lazy, opting too often to tell information ratherthan visually show it. Sinise, giving a memorably low-key performance,nonetheless has a voice that seems out of place for voice-over work,making the narration all the more stilted. The film, which simultaneouslydepicts the relationship between Coleman and Faunia and flashes backto Coleman as a young man (Wentworth Miller), becomes more high-chargedthe longer it goes on, but doesn't go on long enough. Both storiesthepresent-day romance and the earlier life-changing decisions Colemanmadeare powerful in isolated moments, but are not given t he amountof time and depth to fully come alive. Other scenes, such as an impromptudance between Coleman and Nathan and a boxing lesson between the youngColeman and fetching girlfriend Steena (Jacinda Barrett), are poorlyconceived and receive unintentional laughs. The performances are on a plain higher than the film they are in.It is refreshing to once again see Anthony Hopkins (2002's ""Red Dragon"")in a dramatic role that does not involve Hannibal Lecter, and he isexcellent as the Viagra-enhanced Coleman Silk. Hopkins performs ascene where he tells Nathan that Faunia ""is not my one true love,but she is my last love,"" with a decided acceptance in his voice overthe choices he has made in his life that is heartbreaking. NicoleKidman (2002's ""The Hours""), beautiful as ever despite a clear attemptto downgrade her beauty to white-trash level, p lausibly inhabitsthe difficult role of Faunia. Kidman is truly one of the great modern-dayacting talents, and her Faunia smolders with both sexuality and amournful feeling of loss. As the young Coleman, Wentworth Miller (2003's ""Underworld"") astonishesnot so much for his physical likeness to Hopkins but for his uncannyduplication in both voice and mannerism. Jacinda Barrett (2000's ""UrbanLegends: Final Cut""), a former cast member of MTV's ""The Real World,""genuinely surprises in her astute, touching portrayal of Coleman's""one true love,"" Steena. Meanwhile, Ed Harris (2002's ""The Hours"")is underutilized as Faunia's dangerous, jealous ex-husband, Lester.  The most intriguing element of ""The Human Stain"" is the primary questionit acts: how much power does one secret h ave in changing the fateof a person's life? Director Robert Benton, a three-time Academy Awardwinner, is certainly qualified to answer this question, but this storydeserves a more exacting treatment than the one he and screenwriterNicholas Meyer have delivered.

I wish I was young again!"" ""Human Traffic"" is not a great movie, but it taps into the zeitgeist of the many young people who try their hardest to truly ""live"".  That these people are heavily into hallucinogenic drugs is not a subject Kerrigan shies away from. ""Human Traffic"" will, without a doubt, be compared to the similarly fast-paced Scottish import ""Trainspotting"", a film which many believe to have glamorized heroin use. ""Human Traffic"", which is also becoming a cult-classic in the U.K., examines ""the most dominant youth culture there's ever been in Britain, bigger than the rockers, the hippies, the Mods,"" according to Kerrigan. This is a culture where Ecstasy (or ""E"") is the drug of choice. Yes, I am talking about Rave.  ""Human Traffic"" focuses on the lives of a cross-section of Welsh twenty-somethings who use the weekend rave parties to find meaning in their aimless lives. They spend every hour of their dead-end jobs looking forward to the pleasures that the weekend promises. This film is about such a weekend, and the pleasures are as much the viewer's as they are the characters'.  Our guide is Jip (John Simm), an energetic type who is coming to grips with the fact that he is in love with his friend Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington), and that he suffers from an acute case of ""sexual paranoia"". His best friend Koop (Shaun Parkes) suspects that his faithful girlfriend Nina (Nicola Reynolds) is cheating on him with numerous partners, and his buddy Moff (Danny Dyer) is always looking to have fun to rebel against an upper-class upbringing.  Without following a visible plotline, ""Human Traffic"" goes through the motions of a weekend in Rave culture. Late Friday night, the group heads off to a rave where they dance, take drugs, and search for the meaning of life. After the rave there is a party where they dance, take drugs and discuss how ""Star Wars"" is a dissection of life as a junkie. Cleverly, Kerrigan's inventive and stylish film also portrays the uncomfortable aftermath of any Rave weekend: the comedown. By showing the consequences of such a weekend, Kerrigan proves to not be glamorizing the culture, or drugs itself.  Justin Kerrigan claims that he made ""Human Traffic"" because this culture is the one he grew up on, and he felt qualified to make a film based on his experience. In the film, he doesn't try to make excuses for why today's youth are hooked on drugs, or paint negative stereotypes of such youth. Instead, he is trying to provide a Woody Allen-type insight into a generation that takes drugs, but doesn't resort to violence. Drugs are just a part of their weekend routine.  ""Human Traffic"" is hardly groundbreaking (infact, last year's ""Go"" and this year's upcoming ""Groove"" both focus on similar topics in the same culture), but it is an excellent movie because it really understands how much fun life can be. Kerrigan's characters are the type who just say ""yes!"". They know that mixing a bit of fantasy into their reality may be illegal, but to them, its also a risk worth taking. ",Human Traffic,R,2000,3
447,"      Some author's works, John Grisham's for example, are easilyadapted to the big screen.  Although many of Tom Clancy's novels havebeen successfully made into motion pictures, they are so intricatelyand carefully composed that keeping them within the confines of astandard length movie without disturbing their elaborate structure istricky.  Clancy, who is a stickler for absolute devotion to detail,painstakingly researches his books to ensure their accuracy andplausibility.       Clancy's first novel, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, started off hismovie franchise in 1990.  Screenwriters Larry Ferguson and DonaldStewart approached the material as assiduously as Clancy himself withthe result being a screenplay that truly does justice to the book.Later screenwriters have been equally diligent in Clancy adaptations -although no one has ever attempted his complicated second novel, ""RedStorm Rising"" - but none have equaled the cinematic power of THE HUNTFOR RED OCTOBER.       In his best performance ever, Alec Baldwin, an actor whose emotiverange is highly limited, plays Tom Clancy's classic hero, Dr. JackRyan.  (Harrison Ford was picked as a much more bankable star to do thefollow-up films, and he is indeed a better Jack Ryan since he seems somuch more vulnerable.)  Jack's neither a spy nor a military man, perse, he just writes books for the CIA.  But, like the everyman role sopopular in movies from Capra to Hitchcock, he rises to the occasionwhen called.  In Clancy stories, it's in the service of the entireUnited States that his hero is summoned.  Adm. Jim Greer of the CIA,played with his usual forceful presence by James Earl Jones, is the onewho appeals to Jack's sense of patriotism to attempt the impossible.       In THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER the Russians have invented a submarineso quiet that it is virtually undetectable - we are told that we triedto make this technology work but had no luck.  This means the Russianscould park subs just a few miles off our shore so that they can firetheir nuclear missiles before we can retaliate.  The boat's stealthmakes it a first-strike weapon and hence feared by our military.  Onthe maiden voyage of the first such invisible vessel, named the RedOctober, the captain slips away from both sides in the nuclear chessgame.  Is he defecting, is he lost, is he engaging in hostile maneuversor what?  The U.S. and the Russians distrust each other, and one of thebest series of scenes has the political operatives of both sidesengaging in boldfaced lies with each knowing the other is lying and yetnot being quite sure what the real truth is.       As Capt. Marko Ramius, the clever skipper of the Red October, SeanConnery brings such perspicacity to the role that he sets Ramius at thehead of the film's intellectual food chain.  The characters, especiallyJack, try to outguess him, but Ramius generally stays one step ahead ofthem.       The wonderfully intricate story asks many questions.  What, forexample, would Ramius do if he did defect?  And, for a change, thestory pays respect to all the military leaders.  The usual idiots andmegalomaniacs are thankfully absent.       Scott Glenn, who all too often gets such inferior roles as hisrecent disastrous one in FIRESTORM, plays an important one here asCapt. Bart Mancuso, the captain of the American sub tracking Ramius.Mancuso is a cool-headed skipper who's willing to take incredible risksin his war games with Ramius.  Senator Fred Thompson plays anotherbattle-wise American admiral.       The entire cast down to the smallest role is meticulously chosen.Courtney B. Vance is wonderful in the small part of the cocky butfriendly sonar technician.  He manages to hear the undetectable,proving once again that a persistent man can win in the battle againsttechnology.       Tensions mount hard and fast as the Russians launch their entireAtlantic fleet to destroy the Red October.  And the Americans aren'tsure whether to save the sub or sink it.  The story builds as thecombatants try to out psyche each other.       The ever-bold Ramius sends a message to the Russian high commandto reveal his intention to defect.  This means that his fellowdefectors are unable to abandon their plans to travel to the New World.""When he reached the New World, Cortes burned his ships.""  Ramiusexplains as his reasoning for revealing his strategy.  ""As a result hiscrew was well motivated.""       Sam Neill, in a moving performance, plays Ramius's second incommand, who has a simple dream of living in Montana and being able totravel from state to state in an recreational vehicle without a travelvisa.       Cecelia Hall and George Watters, winners of the Academy Award thatyear for sound effects editing, gives the picture a heart-throbbingintensity and enough deep bass to blow your subwoofers.  This iscoupled with the beautiful and impressive underwater scenes of the bigblue steel masses slinking by, all filmed handsomely by Jan de Bont,who would go on to direct TWISTER and both of the SPEED movies.       With its crisp editing by Dennis Virkler and John Wright, who werenominated for an Oscar, the picture maintains maximum sustained impactand tension.  As we learned in the classic film DAS BOOT, there is noplace of higher tension than the claustrophobic confines of asubmarine.       THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER runs 2:15 without a minute of fat.  It israted PG for tension and mild profanity and would be fine for kidsaround 9 and up.       My son Jeffrey, age 9, thought it was a good movie.  He said heespecially liked Connery's acting and the way Jack Ryan was reallysmart.  He admitted he did get a little bit confused by the story. ","Hunt for Red October, The",PG,1990,3
448," In HURLYBURLY, Sean Penn and Kevin Spacey play Eddie and Mickey, twobuddies and coworkers who live in a sea of drugs.  Sharing a plush padthat overlooks the Hollywood hills, they are acting agents who aremaking more money than is good for them.  Even though there is little toeat at their place other than moldy Ding-Dongs, they always have anexpensive stash of cocaine and other drugs.  In what is supposed to be an indictment of the non-existent morals amongsome in the movie business, the characters spend little time on the job.The script by David Rabe, based on his play, is unfocused and almostincomprehensible.  Perhaps it worked on the stage, but the film versionis a disaster that is only made partially watchable by some wonderfulensemble acting by a talented crew, who play characters bent uponvarious forms of self-destruction.  In his usual masterful performance Kevin Spacey displays what passes forsanity in an insane environment.  Mickey is as cool as Eddie is red hot.  ""I'm a real person!"" Eddie screams as he cries and jumps up and downlike a toddler who has to go to the bathroom now or he's going to wethis pants.  That Sean Penn can do such overblown parts withoutoveracting is a testament to his abilities.  ""I know I don't know what Imean, which is better than most people,"" Eddie confesses towards theend.  The extremely talky script revels in its obtuseness, with easily half ofthe conversation being conducted on cell phones.  Most lines make nosense whatsoever, although some are so ridiculous that they aredownright funny.  ""I have thoughts sometime that can break my headopen,"" Chazz Palminteri says as Phil, an ex-con and would-be actorfriend of Eddie's.  Phil is such a lowbrow that any intellectualactivity might short-circuit his brain.  The male oriented story has men ""giving"" women to their friends andtossing them out of speeding cars when they grow bored with them.  Amongthese ""disposable"" women is Donna (Anna Paquin), a young runaway wholives in Artie's (Garry Shandling) elevator until he takes her to hisapartment for sex.  Like a slave, she is offered to Mickey and Eddiewhen they drop by.  Meg Ryan plays Bonnie, a hooker whose claim to fame is that she will doabsolutely anything.  In the film's only serious moment, Eddie tries tosee if his friends have any morals at all by reminding them thatBonnie's 6-year-old daughter watched in catatonic horror the last timethey hired Bonnie to perform sex on a friend from out of town.  Mickeylooks briefly like he will be affected but blows it off with a jokeabout how at least they didn't set the kid on fire.  Robin Wright plays Eddie's girlfriend, Darlene.  ""I can't stand thissemantic insanity any more,"" she yells after Eddie picks a big fightwith her when she doesn't express a preference between a Frenchrestaurant and a Chinese one.  ""I'm finished,"" she concludes.  You'llprobably feel the same way about the movie.  ""What's he talking about?"" Donna asks Eddie about Phil'scircumlocutions.  This is a question that the audience will be askingthemselves throughout most of the movie.  HURLYBURLY runs 2:02.  It is rated R for pervasive drug abuse, sex,profanity and brief nudity.  I would consider the film not acceptablefor those younger than college age. ",Hurlyburly,R,1998,2
449,"What do you get when you cross a 2+ hour Starbucks commercial with KRAMER VS.KRAMER and a five pound bag of sugar?  Jessie Nelson's I AM SAM. (Appropriately, the long first scene is a close-up of Sam arranging andrearranging packets of sugar.)  The Starbucks commercial is interrupted periodically so that the movie can hawkIHOP, Bob's Big Boy, Pizza Hut, Payless Shoes and other products.  With biggerintentions than just garnering product placement fees, I AM SAM wants to be thefilm that finally gets Sean Penn his Oscar.  His schmaltzy performance, whichplays like an acting school class lesson, is just the sort that the Academyloves, especially since his character is mentally challenged.  If you want togamble your hard earned dollars on this year's winner, Penn would be a smartchoice.  Personally, I had enough of it after the first five minutes.  The script, co-written by Kristine Johnson (THE STORY OF US) and Jessie Nelson,concerns a man named Sam -- as in ""Sam I Am"" from Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eyes AndHam""  -- who has the mental capacity of a seven year old.  This single dad,played accurately but gratingly by Sean Penn, has a daughter who has just hadher seventh birthday.  Named Lucy -- as in ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" --the girl is played too knowingly by blonde-haired, blue-eyed cutie DakotaFanning.  Fanning's only other picture, surprisingly, was the raunchy TOMCATS. The problem with her performance as Lucy is that she is as wise and mature as ateenager.  (Those parents with teenagers, please avoid the urge to write me toeducate me about my misconceptions about teenagers' wisdom and maturity.)  Just when the movie looks hopelessly maudlin, Sam is arrested for soliciting aprostitute -- one of many scenes that ring false.  The arrest puts in motion asequence of events that causes the courts to want to take Lucy from Sam, whichmeans he needs a lawyer.  Wanting the best ""four names"" lawyer he can't afford,retains Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer), who reluctantly takes his case pro bono. The two of them are like sweet-and-sour sauce.  Pfeiffer cuts through thesaccharin and almost makes the movie worthwhile.  The overly plotted tale gives Rita a son that she's too busy to see, much lessplay with.  Meanwhile, she works hard for a client like Sam who has all the loveand time to give but is being prevented from giving them.  Pfeiffer is terrificand funny even if never quite believable.  (The only credible character isplayed by Laura Dern as an exemplary foster mother.)  Pfeiffer's funniest momentoccurs when she keeps screaming ""Home!"" into a voice activated cell phone thatwon't listen properly.  Her type-A character is never smart enough to realizethat she could easily punch in the number.  This highly manipulative commercial masquerading as a movie could at least havehad the grace not to go on forever.  At our screening, even those who liked itthought it went on way too long.    Wait for video and borrow your neighbor's tape.  If, after five minutes, you'vealready reached sugar overload, you won't have wasted anything.  I AM SAM runs 2:13.  It is rated PG-13 for ""language"" and would be acceptablefor kids around 11 and up. ",I Am Sam,PG-13,2002,2
450,"Kuki Gallmann is an amazing woman whose story is a testamentto courage, determination, and tenacity.  Two years ago, I had theprivilege of meeting Kuki and spending several evenings with her onher ranch in Kenya.  An Italian aristocrat by birth, Kuki (KimBasinger) begins her tale with how she met Paolo (Vincent Perez), hersecond husband, who convinced her to move with her young son,Emanuele, to Kenya in 1974, over the protests of her mother (Eva MarieSaint).  Despite difficulty in adjusting to the tempo and pace oflife, the dangerous wildlife, greedy poachers, the ravages of nature,and - most of all- the loneliness at Ol Ari Nyiro ranch, Kuki fellpassionately in love with Africa. Her devotion was so intense that itwithstood two devastating losses. Paolo was killed in a car accidentdriving home with a cradle for their unborn daughter and, three yearslater, Emanuele, an amateur herpetologist, was fatally bitten by apuff adder. Yet, with all this inherent drama, the film skims over thesurface. Written by Paula Milne & Susan Shilliday and directed by HughHudson, it never develops an emotional connection between theaudience, nor does it communicate a challenging sense ofadventure. Instead, it unfolds with the languid pace of a magnificenttravelogue. While Kim Basinger is appealing, she doesn't captureKuki's zest and enthusiasm - let alone her flamboyant style andItalian accent. In comparison with ""Out of Africa,"" Kim's no MerylStreep, nor is Vincent Perez a Robert Redford.  On the Granger MovieGauge of 1 to 10, ""I Dreamed of Africa"" is a stunning, lyrical 6. Youcan stay at Kuki's Mukutan Retreat in Laikipia on the edge of theGreat Rift Valley to experience the wonders of Africa'swilderness. But if you can't take that trip, seeing this movie is thenext-best thing. ",I Dreamed of Africa,PG-13,2000,3
451," Painfully unfunny, I HEART HUCKABEES is a ridiculous mess of a movie by DavidO. Russell.  After his nearly universally acclaimed success with THREE KINGS,this pathetic picture will come as a real disappointment to his fans.    The story concerns one Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), anenvironmentalist who is troubled by some recent coincidences in his lifeinvolving a Sudanese emigrant whom Albert has recently seen three times indifferent places.  To answer the larger picture of what this means, Albertemployees Bernard and Vivian, a pair of wacky existential detectives playedhamily by Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin, to probe the meaning of Albert'splace in the cosmos.  Bernard and Vivian believe that everything is connected,so they spy on Albert wherever he goes, even in the bathroom, in order todecipher his mysteries.  Isabelle Huppert plays Caterine Vauban, a rival ofBernard and Vivian's.  Caterine believes nothing is connected, and life is just""random and cruel.""  Talking a mile a minute, no one ever makes any sense, and there isn't a singleinteresting character in the movie, which also stars Jude Law, Mark Wahlbergand Naomi Watts.  The film opens with a silly poem about a big rock and goesstraight downhill from there.  ""Boring, boring!"" Angela (Angela Grillo) yells in protest during anenvironmentalist meeting chaired by Albert, as he reads another of thosepompous little poems of his.  Her taunts eventually drown him out.  Don't besurprised if you similarly feel like booing from your seat to drown out thisawful waste of time and talent.  I had to restrain my fingers while writingthis review.  They kept wanting to type I HATE HUCKABEES, and who could blamethem.  They had to sit through it too.  I HEART HUCKABEES runs a long 1:46.

452,">Every now and then, reviewers are faced with the films thatare hard to be properly reviewed. Most of the time ithappens with films that leave so overwhelming impact, eithergood or bad, that in the end reviewers must work hard toexpress his thoughts or feelings. But, sometimes it canhappen for rather trivial reasons. I LOVE TROUBLE happenedto be one of such occasions for the author of this review.The impression left by the film wasn't overwhelming - on thecontrary, there were hardly any impression at all, since Ihad real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it.Which surprise me to this day, because the movie theatre wasfull, I was close to sound speakers, the show wasn't lateand I didn't lack sleep before the show. Such things happenvery rarely to me, and, after many years, the closest thingto solution to this mystery is probably the quality of thefilm itself.  The plot revolves around two rival Chicago reporters - oldPeter Brackett (Nick Nolte) and young, aspiring SabrinaPeterson (Julia Roberts). Two of them are assigned to coverthe train collision. As soon as they meet, they startscooping each other, but during the process they bothdiscover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk, and alsothe romantic feelings they have for each other. The plot inthis film is rather secondary to its real raison d'tre -romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comediesstarring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Movie author,director and screenwriter Charles Shyer, who had someexperiences with turning the screwball spirit into modernsetting with FATHER OF THE BRIDE, tries again, this timepairing old Nick Nolte with young Julia Roberts. However,although there is some chemistry between the two, soon itstops to arouse any interest. It probably happens due topoorly executed genre mix, that collides light-heartedromantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable topure action thrillers. Shyer as director fails to make theproper transition between the two, and fails in both areas,making the story cliched and predictable. The end result israther forgettable effort, which convinced me not to watchmovie again. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, though. ",I Love Trouble,PG,1994,3
453,"      I'LL DO ANYTHING is UNIQUE in movie history, but I'll save thereason for the end of the review.  The story is about a washed up actor(Nick Nolte) and his daughter, (newcomer Whittni Wright), played as theclassic child from hell type, who turns into a successful child actingstar.  Albert Brooks plays the producer.  Nolte is usually good and heis here, but nothing special.  In every movie, I have ever seen AlbertBrooks in, especially BROADCAST NEWS, he has been nothing less thanterrific.  In this movie he is okay, but nothing more.  To be honest,his part was not well written - too timid or something - so I think hedid good as he could.  The best part is the child's.  She is reallycute, and I hope to see her again.       The worst part was the script by  James L.  Brooks.  It just doesnot make you care enough about the characters yet all are potentiallyquite interesting.  There were a few good one liners, especially in thesmall part of the mom played by Tracy Ullman.  The directing was alsoby James L.  Brooks who did BROADCAST NEWS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.Here he is too timid with his cast as if he is afraid to open up andtake a few risks.       What is unique about this movie?  It was originally a musical butat the screenings, people hated the songs, but liked the movie.  Theyreedited it to take out all of the songs, and released it anyway.  Idid find myself unsuccessfully looking for where the musical numbersmust have been.       I'LL DO ANYTHING runs too long at 1:56.  With the missing songsthis movie would have gone on forever.  It is rated PG-13, but ispretty harmless show.  Some movies are great in places and awful inothers.  I'LL DO ANYTHING on the other hand is extremely uniform albeithighly forgettable.  I rated at a constant ** 1/2 and give it a thumbsup if you are looking for a pleasant movie that never taxes your brain. ",I'll Do Anything,PG-13,1994,2.5
454,"With 1994's ""The Crow"" and 1998's ""Dark City,"" director Alex Proyasauspiciously demonstrated his abilities as a cinematic visionary,creating stylized, brooding new worlds never before glimpsed on thesilver screen. Even without a solid script (something the mesmerizing""Dark City"" did, indeed, have), the experience of simply watchinga Proyas film would be an awe-inspiring delight. ""I, Robot,"" an aestheticand technical marvel ""inspired by"" the stories of Isaac Asimov, continuesthe trend. The future world Proyas has fashioned here is clear andmeticulous, reminiscent of 2002's ""Minority Report"" but far more accomplishedand visually pleasing than Steven Spielberg's recent tiresome preferencetoward washed-out, grainy film stocks. Set in Chicago, circa 2035, a time in which obedient, programmed robotshave taken over many working-class jobs and will soon number 1/5 ofthe population, homicide cop Del Spooner (Will Smith) can't help butbe wary of these technological inventions. His suspicions only growwhen Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), the distinguished creatorand head of the U.S. Robotics Corporation (USR), is found dead. Whilerobot programmer Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and Lanning's successor,Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), insist that his death was asuicide, Spooner is none so sure when one of the robots, named Sonny(Alan Tudyk), threatens him with a gun out of fear. Sonny, it turnsout, is unlike most of the robots, able to free-thinkingly interact,feel emotions, and even dream. Spooner's investigation leads him tofind that many of the robots about to be released into the homes ofthe general public have evolved far beyond abiding by human's commands,and are quietly plan ning to take over society. The near-future director Alex Proyas has envisioned for ""I, Robot""is a veritable triumph of art direction, cinematography, and visualeffects, the latter of which are, without a doubt, some of the mostconvincing and lifelike in movie history. Likewise, the photorealisticCGI robots are integrated seamlessly with the human actors and live-actionsurroundings to the point where it hardly seems like computer effectsat all. When the robots perform various stunts, including jumpingand scaling buildings, it is superior to anything found in ""Spider-Man2""„quite a remarkable feat. As for the details of this 2035 visionof the world (i.e. all technology is voice-activated, and cars thatrun on gas are viewed as archaic), some of it seems a bit exaggerated,but not to the point where it becomes wildly implausible or takesthe viewer out of the story. The screenplay, credited to Jeff Vintar (2001's ""Final Fantasy: TheSpirits Within"") and Akiva Goldsman (2001's ""A Beautiful Mind""), dodgesmost of the pitfalls of big summer blockbusters. Whereas the recent""The Day After Tomorrow"" garnered unintentional laughs out of itsclumsy, cornball dialogue and unbelievable plot specifics, Vintarand Goldsman's writing is taut and appropriately no-nonsense. Theyalso do well with developing the picture's timely message„that humansare slowly destroying themselves and the world around them every day„withoutwallowing on it or spoon-feeding it to audiences. And while thereare a handful of sequences where one's suspension of disbelief isrequired, it remains largely grounded in the reality of the situations.Som e of Will Smith's usual one-liners, however, not overdone butstill unnecessary, feel distinctly out of place. For Will Smith, his performance as protagonist Del Spooner is moreunderstated and serious than his work in such low-rent, high-budgetprojects as 1996's ""Independence Day,"" 2002's ""Men in Black II,"" and2003's deplorable ""Bad Boys 2."" He always has charisma to spare, butthose who remember his award-caliber acting in 1993's ""Six Degreesof Separation"" know that Smith is capable of much more than thesetypecast parts. He would do well to try a smaller, more character-drivenpiece in the near future to reestablish his talent. As USR employeeSusan Calvin, who teams up with Spooner to stop the robot invasion,Bridget Moynahan (2003's ""The Recruit"") improves as the film unfolds,but is so wooden in the first half that she resembled the very robotsher character programmed. As far as this summer's special effects extravaganzas go, ""I, Robot""is not the best„that title would still go to ""Spider-Man 2""„but itis smart and creative enough to come surprisingly close. The actionset-pieces, including the demolition of a mansion while Spooner isstill inside and a robot attack on his speeding car, are strikinglyand suspensefully woven throughout the two hour running time, servingthe plot in the process without becomes extraneous. Only the finaleseems decidedly anticlimactic, coming to a close a little too soonfor the payoff to be an unequivocal success. ""I, Robot"" has its certaindemerits, but what surrounds them is so innovative and stunninglyorchestrated that they hardly make a difference. This is a wide-scopesci-fi thriller done right. ","I, Robot",PG-13,2004,3
455,"As yet another parody of the James Bond series, ""I-Spy"" ispretty pallid stuff, not even up to the 1960's TV series whichfeatured Bill Cosby and Robert Culp as the black-white pair ofgovernment agents.  The principal plus of the film is a dandyproduct placement for Budapest, which competes with Prague forthe title of Europe's prettiest city just as newly-drafted spy KellyRobinson (Eddie Murphy) competes to maintain his undefeatedstreak as middleweight champion of the world.  Opening like a007 thriller in Uzbekistan, a mountain scenario thatdepicts professional spy Alexander Scott (Owen Wilson) as abumbling, Inspector Clouseau who cannot begin to compete withAmerica's top agent, Carlos (Gary Cole), ""I-Spy"" is a buddy-from-hell romp about a mismatched duo who bicker and whine untilmutual need ultimately brings them together.     The plot, from a screenplay written by a committee of four, ismerely a setup to allow Eddie Murphy to chew up the scenery. As usual he acts as though on speed, chattering like Chris Tuckerin Brett Ratner's ""Rush Hour"" and displaying the same contemptfor his partner as did Tucker with Jackie Chan.  Kelly Robinson,fresh from his 57th victory in the ring, is teamed up with AlexanderScott on a mission to Budapest to seize the latest in aircrafttechnology, a stealth aircraft that can literally disappear from viewat the touch of a button and is therefore immune to radar.  Theplane is on sale to the highest bidder, with world-class armsmerchant Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell) about to deliver themachine to the country that bids the highest.       The throwaway action scenes involving an exploding car, anuninspired chase, and a series of machine-gun battles are somuch stuff to get out of the way to allow the audience to enjoyMurphy's riffs, the most hilarious one showing the forty-one yearold Brooklyn born actor playing Cyrano de Bergerac to Wilson'sChristian de Neuvillette, instructing the blond ""surf boy"" in the artof expressing his love to his Roxane in the form of Special AgentRachel Wright (Famke Janssen).       Oliver Wood films the first-class extensive stunt work inBudapest and Vancouver. If only the comedy were wittier and theaction more original!   Betty Thomas, a Second City improv clubperformer turned actress, moving into an Emmy-award winningrole on ""Hill Street Blues"" and director of comedies, has donebetter with ""Private Parts,"" utilizing Howard Stern's outrageousnessto good effect.  Here, though, Murphy tries hard to save a genericscript, which is encumbered further by the high volume on thetheater sound system which makes some punch lines virtuallyinaudible. ",I-Spy,PG-13,2002,2
456,"      It's frequently the small details that make the difference betweena good picture and an outstanding one.  Director Ang Lee (SENSE ANDSENSIBILITY, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, and THE WEDDING BANQUET) is a masterat the minutia of story telling.       In THE ICE STORM, set in an unhappy period of the early 1970s whenthe sexual revolution and the Watergate scandal were both in fullswing, Lee uses close-ups of a metaphor-laden metal ice tray to tellthe story.  The adults in the film, and to lesser extent the teenagers,are as cold to each other as ice, and each will be broken in many waysbefore their melancholy story ends.       ""Ben, you're boring me,"" complains Sigourney Weaver as a harshlooking Janey Carver to a tired and befuddled Kevin Kline as her loverand neighbor Ben Hood.  ""I have a husband.  I don't have a need foranother one.""  You see, he has committed the cardinal sin of talkingseriously to her after their regularly scheduled tryst.  She is therefor sex and is put off by the effrontery of his speaking to her.  JamesSchamus's script based on the novel by Rick Moody is dead-on in thisscene as in all the others.       Carol Oditz's costumes and Michael Bigger's make-up gives theearly 70s an accurate but exceedingly ugly look.  Never have longlapels and gaudy leisure suits looked worse.  Only Joan Allen, whosteals the show as Ben's repressed wife Elena, manages to look good inher hairspray-hardened coiffure.  A fragile statuette who looks ever indanger of cracking, she plays a wife who tries to ignore her husband'sinfidelities even as she yearns for some of her own.  Like all of theother characters, she is massively unhappy with her life.  Kleptomaniaturns out to be her method for sexual arousal.       Mark Friedberg's sets for the film are set in a depressingly grayand leafless New Canaan, Conn.  The days are short and cold as a bleakwinter approaches.  Again, metaphors abound.       Along with the adults' preoccupation with sex, the kids arebeginning to experiment.  And I do mean experiment.  Christina Ricci,as Ben's 14-year-old daughter Wendy, offers Janey's son Mikey, playedwild-eyed by Elijah Wood, a sexual encounter, but with a condition.She must be permitted to wear her large Nixon mask during it.  When herfather finds them in Janey's basement, he is almost renderedspeechless.  Afterall, he just left Janey's bed upstairs.       In another scene, Wendy takes Mikey's younger brother Sandy,played with devilish innocence by Adam Hann-Byrd, into the bathroom forthe classic game of you-show-me-yours-and-I'll-show-you-mine.  WhenJaney finds them, she hypocritically delivers an overly long and obtuselecture to Wendy that includes the admonition, ""A person's body is histemple.""  (Yes, ""his"" since the 1970s predate the political correctnessera.)       All of the performances are tour de force, but incrediblydepressing.  The show offers only a few possibly redemptive scenes.       The film's long ending sequence makes the picture.  As its titlesuggests, it includes an ice storm.  During the storm the adults attenda ""California key party.""  Like a grown-up version of spin-the-bottle,each woman gets to go home with the man whose car keys she fishes outof a big bowl.  Never has sex seemed more dismal that in this sad gameof spouse-swapping.  Even when the men get the worse looking ones atthe party, they awkwardly seem to jump for joy.  But THE ICE STORM isnever a comedy, not even a black comedy.  It is a deadly serious andmorose morality tale and the slowest and the darkest movie yet from AngLee.  It is a devastating film that will almost certainly leave youemotionally drained.       THE ICE STORM runs 1:52.  It is rated R for drugs, sex and maturethemes.  The film would be fine for older and mature teenagers.  Istrongly recommend the picture to you and give it *** 1/2. ","Ice Storm, The",R,1997,3
457,"  If ""Idle Hands,"" the new horror-comedy directed with devilish glee by  Rodman Flender (""Leprechaun 2""), has it's fair share of problems, which  it does, you'll just have to excuse me for not mentioning some of them.  First and foremost, this film was an extremely nostalgic experience for  me, a fun and twisted throwback to the goofy slasher films of the '80s.  Last year's crummy ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" was also  exactly like '80s horror, but was tiresome and had no true entertainment  value. In other words, ""I Still Know..."" took itself way too seriously,  and therefore suffered the consequences, while ""Idle Hands"" knows  exactly how to have a good time, be damned.    The film gets off to a fabulous start, as a kooky middle-aged married  couple (Fred Willard, Connie Ray) have just settled down for the night.  Seeing the words, ""I'm under the bed,"" sprawled on the ceiling, they  immediately hear a noise downstairs. The husband goes down to check it  out, and never returns. Then she goes down to see where he is. You know  the procedure, but instead of feeling cliched, the scene is both  genuinely suspenseful and had me rolling in the aisles at its already  over-the-top, sick humor.    The next morning, we meet 17-year-old slacker Anton Tobias (Devon Sawa),  a clueless teenager who spends his days loafing on the couch watching  television and smoking marijuana. After not seeing his parents for a  couple days, he tells his friends, Mick (Seth Green) and Pnub (Elden  Henson), but doesn't really think anything of it. After accidentally  discovering their bodies (whose location in the house will remain unsaid  so the surprise will be kept), Anton quickly discovers that his right  hand is possessed by Satan, and is starting to control him, killing  anybody in its path, including Mick and Pnub. When Anton confronts him  about his unfortunate situation, his dark, brooding neighbor (Jack  Noseworthy) remarks that, ""Idle hands are the devil's playground. Just  keep them busy."" Ultimately, the violent proceedings lead up to the  school's Halloween dance, in which the now-severed hand goes on a  murderous rampage.   ""Idle Hands"" is a delirious, no-holds-barred attempt at creating a  slasher movie with lots of campy and outrageous humor. While some of it  fails (including the whole subplot dealing with Mick and Pnub, who  return from the grave), much of it really is funny, and I couldn't help  but be reminded of the so-bad-they're-great '80s horror flicks that this  film obviously gets its inspiration from. Back in those days, there were  very few redeeming qualities, just gory killing after gore killing,  intermingled with a helpful dosage of gratuitous nudity. In the '90s,  however, things have matured a bit, there isn't quite as much blood to  be had in these types of movies, and there is never any t&a. With ""Idle  Hands,"" this has all changed, and you would not believe how much  enjoyment is to be had at seeing a film like that once again, and on the  big screen.   For one thing, this film does a much better job at portraying Halloween  (my favorite holiday) than the self-titled ""Halloween: H20,"" and the  very first shot in the film is an instant classic (at least for me), as  the camera starts on a brightly-lit pumpkin and then pans through a  heavily Halloween-decorated yard, and into an upstairs window. Due to  this example and several other impressively-shot scenes, the  cinematography is distinctive and well-done, as is the memorable music  score by composer Graeme Revell.   Once Anton's hand is possessed, ""Idle Hands"" unfortunately begins to  meander with an overemphasis on slapstick, but once the hands is cut off  and it sets out for the dance in the last thirty minutes, the movie  returns to its high-energy mode and is a treat from there on. The rock  band, ""Offspring,"" makes an appropriate cameo at the dance as they sing  the Ramones songs, ""I Wanna Be Sedated,"" while nubile teens are  dispatched of in gruesome ways, and two particular girls, one of which  is Anton's new girlfriend, Molly (Jessica Alba), must escape through the  ventilation system and crawl through a sharp, spinning fan that has been  stopped up (but for how long?) by a shoe.    In the central roles, Devon Sawa is an adequate protagonist who is given  plenty of opportunity to show off his talent (or lack thereof) of  physical comedy. Seth Green and Elden Henson have some fun with their  respective roles, especially after they have been killed (with Mick  having a beer bottle engouged in his forehead, and Pnub actually  carrying around his severed head). Jessica Alba is nice eye candy, in a  ditsy female sort of way, but as was so evident in the older slasher  movies, is a one-dimensional damsel-in-distress. Finally, Vivica A. Fox  is hysterical in the smallish role of Deb, a spicy Druid priestess who  sets out to find the possessed hand.   ""Idle Hands"" is bloody, violent, dumb, and shallow, but it also boosts  some clever ideas amidst the rising body count. It may not be a great  movie, but it's one of the most amusing times I've had at the multiplex  this whole year. ",Idle Hands,R,1999,1.5
458,"In Bob Rafelson's 1970 movie ""Five Easy Pieces,"" JackNicholson's character, Robert Eroica Dupea, gives up a careeras a promising classical pianist to work on an oil rig and live athoroughly blue-collar existence with a waitress.  This is by wayof indicating that you don't have to be a teenager to rebel but ithelps.  Get that furious opposition to authority out of yoursystem so you'll be free to sell out like the rest of us normalpeople.  In Burr Steers' ""Igby Goes Down"" which Steers beganas a novel and who then, two years into the project realized hecould define his characters better in a visual medium the titlecharacter, Jason ""Igby"" Slocumb Jr. could almost give RobertDupea some lessons in rebellion.     As portrayed by the remarkable Kieran Culkin, Jason sonicknamed because of a stuffed toy whose name hemispronounced as Igby is a 17-year-old kid; smart, with a bitingtongue and the ability to use his sharp wit to parry the thrusts ofanyone older than he, whether the opposition is his slightly olderbrother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) or a superannuated reverendwho runs a strict school near Igby's toney Connecticut nabe.       Sporting a cast of some of filmdom's most honoredperformers, including Jeff Goldblum as Igby's godfather D.H.Baines, Claire Danes as Igby's would-be girl friend SookieSapperstein, Susan Sarandon as the teenager's distant motherMimi, and Ryan Phillippe as his Ivy-League educated brother,""Igby Goes Down"" shows us above all what we suspected allalong: that families contain members who are so different fromone another that you'd scarcely believe there are just sixdegrees of separation between the youngest kid and the oldestgranddaddy.  While coming-of-age tales of teen angst and areabundant in literature and the screen Holden Caulfield'ssupercilious anomie in J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye""being, of course, the best known by today's high-schoolkids Steers in some ways one-ups the great Mr. Salinger in hisremarkably entertaining, sincere, authentic, even gripping yarnabout a kid whose ups and downs sometimes appear to behappening regardless of his manifold experiences with others.     To prove that material goods do not buy happiness but rather,that money can, and should, allow its possessor freely tochoose the sort of life he wants to lead, Steers hones in on Igby,a poor little rich boy whose mother, however distant, will notleave him alone.  She chooses the boy's schools; she makeslittle effort to see why the young man repeatedly flunks out. Mimi Slocumb, afflicted with breast cancer and determined tocast Jason as a reflection of herself, simply listens to complaintsof the headmaster of a church-supported school, takes the boyout of the academy, and puts him into a military institution. Needless to say Igby hates the idiotic regimentation, and literally""goes down"" when some moronic upperclassmen beat him withbroomsticks in an incident that recalls the New York policebeating of Abner Louima.  Inundated with experiences of earlyfailure, Igby is determined to bop around from one experience toanother, hoping to accumulate enough empirical knowledge tohelp him rise to life's occasion.     Steers peppers the movie with sharp dialogue, mostly fromthe mouth of Kieran Culkin, younger brother of the 22-year-oldMacaulay and older sib of Rory Culkin (who appears in the filmas Igby's younger self).  Sitting in the office of the headmaster-reverend of a school from which he is to be expelled, hewonders aloud, ""If heaven is so great, why is the crucifixionsuch a terrible sacrifice?""  Later the slightly older woman (ClaireDanes) whom he meets while she is on leave from Benningtonto ""get her life together,"" chastises him: ""You're a furious boy.Eventually you won't be a boy and it will eat you up.""   When hismom, who will reveal a special secret to  Igby later in the movieremarks, ""His creation was an act of animosity.  Why should hislife be?"" we can see how the lad can grow to hate his motherand why in addition he blames her for the growingschizophrenia of his old-money dad (played in a too-small roleby Bill Pullman).     In a film released shortly before this one, ""One-Hour Photo,""Robin Williams' lonely character looks with envy and longing ata seemingly warm, comfortable family who appear to haveeverything that he does not.  Appearances, however, are asillusory as the photos that peek out from the little envelopes inthe photos shops or on the CD's in the computer.  Money doesnot help when one person loses most of it throughschizophrenia, as does Jason Slocum in Steers' film, or whenyou're on the brink of losing your life like Mimi Slocumb, or whenyou're a self-made millionaire like Jeff Goldblum's D.H. with awife who is, as Igby puts it, ""no longer the sharpest tool in theshed"" and whose trophy girl friend betrays him with an unlikelysuitor.  Nor is Igby's well-dressed, well-spoken, youngrepublican in the shape of Igby's older brother Oliver toopleased with himself.  He wants money, lots of it, but he knowsat heart that he's a phony and that he will have to betray hisidentity to earn it.     ""Igby Goes Down"" is a complex interplay of family neurosesmade to look oh so easy by the talented Mr. Steers, and shouldany in the audience feel that his story speaks personally tohim that you were forced to attend schools you hated and tostudy for a career you had no use for or that you cannot get overyour hatred for one or both parents that's all to the good. ",Igby Goes Down,R,2002,3
459,"Great play, great cast, mediocre movie.  Writer-director Oliver Parker's lastpicture was the absolutely charming AN IDEAL HUSBAND, which was based on anOscar Wilde play.  Trying his luck again with another Wilde comedy, THEIMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, the director shoots and just misses.  It's a fineline, but Parker makes Wilde's dry, sardonic wit just a bit too dry and toosilly.  The killer cast of this comedy of manners and fake identities includes RupertEverett (MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING), Colin Firth (BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY), ReeseWitherspoon (LEGALLY BLONDE), Judi Dench (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE), Frances O'Connor(A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) and Tom Wilkinson (IN THE BEDROOM).  All of theactors do everything that is asked of them, including some bizarre fantasysequences set in Medieval Europe, which manage only to look weird.    Wilde's one-liners are terrific.  ""I do not approve of anything that interfereswith natural ignorance,"" is one of the thoughts that Lady Bracknell (Dench)shares with Jack Worthing (Firth), a.k.a. Ernest, when he is applying for theposition of future husband of Gwendolen Fairfax (O'Connor).  Since the women inthe story have taken a liking to the name Ernest, Algernon Moncrieff (Everett)tells Cecily Cardew (Witherspoon) that Ernest is his name.  Like a slightly wet firecracker, the movie needlessly fizzles more often that itsizzles.

460,"      Follow the bouncing ball and sing-along, ""Macho, macho man, I wantto be a macho man.""  Now, as this is essentially IN AND OUT's themesong, keep it going in your subconscious as you read the rest of thisreview, and it will put you in just the right mood to hear about one ofthe funniest comedies of the year.       Remember when Tom Hanks received the Academy Award forPHILADELPHIA and thanked his gay high school teacher?  Well, whenproducer Scott Rudin heard this, he had an immediate idea for comedy.What if the teacher either wasn't gay or wasn't known to be gay?       The resulting movie, IN AND OUT, by writer Paul Rudnick fromJEFFREY and director Frank Oz from THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD and DIRTYROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, literally bursts with comedic energy.  The audienceat my advanced screening laughed so hard and so often that it wouldtake another viewing to hear all of the delicious jokes properly.       Set in the Normal Rockwell hamlet of Greenleaf, Indiana, the storyopens on a prissy high school drama teacher named Howard Brackett, who,after a long, three-year engagement, is finally going to tie the knotin just one week. Kevin Kline, reportedly chosen after Steve Martinpassed on the part, plays Howard.  In short, he is terrific especiallyin the film's dance routine.  (For the record, I think Steve Martinwould have been even better but Kline gives a performance worthy ofOscar consideration.)       Tonight is the Oscars presentation and the entire town gathersaround their television sets to see if Howard's ex-student CameronDrake, played as a blonde Hollywood airhead by Matt Dillon, will winthe award for best actor.       The real Academy Awards show should be this funny.  After filmclips of Cameron in an awful war picture, Glenn Close names the bestactor nominees including Steven Seagal for A SNOWBALL IN HELL, anobvious reference to his chance of ever getting the real award.  WhenCameron wins, he thanks everyone, finishing with, ""To Howard Brackettfrom Greenleaf, Indiana [Pause] and he's gay.""       The entire town freezes for a moment.  When they recover, Howardtells his fiancee Emily Montgomery, played by Joan Cusack, that he hasno idea what Cameron is talking about.  Two nanoseconds later, his mom(Debbie Reynolds) and dad (Wilford Brimley) appear on his doorstep.  ""Imay sue,"" Howard off-handedly suggests to them.  ""Get Johnny Cochrane,not that woman,"" advises his dad.  Aren't parents helpful?       The next morning a phalanx of television reporters descends on thehigh school.  Most leave the following morning, but gay reporter PeterMalloy, played with intense pseudo-seriousness by Tom Selleck, staysfor the week.  He does man-on-the-street interviews, asking thequestion that all America wants to know -- Will Howard actually getmarried at the end of the week?  In one report, Peter summarizes thetroubles with poetic drama.  ""A teacher in trouble,"" he intones.  ""Atown under siege.  A journey to the Heartland.  Stay tuned.""       Easily the funniest part of the show is the training Howard putshimself through to demonstrate his masculinity.  He hopes to convincethe town that he truly isn't gay.  He plays a self-help tape where heis supposed to repeat the tough guy lines.  He repeats the first twofine -- ""Yo"" and ""Hot damn.""  When he repeats the third, ""What afabulous window treatment,"" the tape stops him in mid-sentence saying,""That was a trick.""       The tape then instructs him that real men don't dance.  (""Be aman.  Think of John Wayne, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Arnold doesn'tdance.  He can barely walk."")  Howard goes wild at this point in anuncontrollable and well choreographed dance routine to ""Macho man.""You will never be able to hear this song again without dancing aroundthe room.       The script itself is the real star of the show.  It manages toelicit huge laughs without resorting to slapstick, and it finds humorin unlikely spots.  One group of elderly women decide to bare theirsecrets.  One confesses to having pilfered a special Rice Krispy Treatrecipe from a dead woman's recipe file, and another fesses up to havinghated THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.       Everyone in the movie is in top form.  Bob Newhart, as the dourprincipal, gets away with lines that would sound ridiculous coming fromanyone else.  Joan Cusack takes a simple prop -- a fluffy white weddingdress -- and does more funny things with it than would seem possible.When she enters a tiny car with automatic shoulder straps, for example,she is engulfed in a sea of lace.       Even minor characters such Cameron's trophy girlfriend,swizzle-stick-looking supermodel Sonja, played with suitable coldnessby Shalom Harlow, get great lines.  When Cameron has the audacity tosuggest they go to Greenleaf to help Howard, she tells him she is busyright now.  She has a show to do she says and, ""I have to shower andvomit.""       About halfway through the film, the writer briefly looks as thoughhe has painted himself into a comedic corner, but he extricates thestory quickly and picks right back up with the humor.  The show endswith a suitably uproarious sequence.       IN AND OUT is such a splendid and infectiously happy comedy thatwhen you walk through the parking lot after the movie, you willundoubtedly still be able to hear the audience's laughter and theshow's energetic music reverberating in your head.       IN AND OUT flies by at just 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for maturethemes and a little profanity.  The show would be fine kids around tenand up.  I recommend the picture to you highly and give it *** 1/2. ",In & Out,PG-13,1997,2.5
461,"Based on the novel by Susanna Moore, ""In the Cut"" is a fascinatingpsychological character study wrapped in a murder mystery where theidentity of the villain hardly seems to be the point. Although itwill likely displease and bewilder filmgoers used to the more conventionalside of cinematic thrillers, it holds so much depth, so much innovation,and such a crystal-clear vision of what its intentions are, that morelearned film buffs are in for a treat. And, as written and directedby Jane Campion (1993's ""The Piano""), ""In the Cut"" is pitch-blackin its to ne and admirably uncompromising in its character portrayalsand narrative details. It is easily one of the most hauntingand bestmotionpictures of the year. In a startling change from her usual frothy romantic comedies, MegRyan (2001's ""Kate & Leopold"") has delivered the kind of powerful,three-dimensional, courageous performance that expands and strengthenscareers (think Nicole Kidman, who produces here). Ryan has gottenmuch publicity for baring it all here, and that she does, but whatis so very astonishing and risque about her Oscar-worthy turn hasnothing to do with nudity. In her portrayal of English professor Frannie Thorstin, Meg Ryan hasshed her blonde hair and perky demeanor for a faded brown mop andan imploding personality whose stark realism cuts right to the bone.Frannie, who is an intelligent lover of words, discovers at the mostseemingly inopportune time in her life that she has a sexual hungerthat has gone unsatisfied for too long. After witnessing a man inshadow receiving oral gratification in the basement of a New YorkCity bar, Frannie's pent-up sex drive gets a sudden fetishistic jump-startof its own. Unfortunately, her attraction toward Detective GiovanniMalloy (Mark Ruffalo) surfaces just as his investigation into a localserial killerparts of whose latest victim was found in Frannie's gardenleadshim to her. As the killer threatens to strike again, Frannie embarkson an exceedingly dangerous sexual relationship with Malloy, despiteher better judgment and the rising suspicions that the psychopathin question may very well be him. What Meg Ryan has done in her complex, demanding role of Frannie isnot a cheap ploy to be taken seriously as an actress. If such an achievementoccurs, more power to her. What Ryan has really done, however, iscreated a true-to-life, flawed character, and done it flawlessly.Her Frannie is not n aive; she recognizes that her sexual dealingsare unhealthy and her relationship with Malloy is inappropriate, butshe gains a sort of carnal satisfaction and internal strength fromher own discovered masochism that is difficult for her to give up.In what looks to have been emotionally draining, Meg Ryan gives oneof the year's most brilliantly fascinating performances. And for writer-director Jane Campion, she has crafted a challengingpiece of work that falls somewhere between art and entertainment,while garnering the right to be both. Along with top-notch cinematographerDion Beebe (2002's ""Chicago""), Campion evokes a dreamlike qualityto the proceedings as Frannie delves into matters she is inexperiencedin and unsure about, but that may have serious, life-changing repercussions.The camerawork, intentionally jittery and seemingly at a constantstruggle to capture focus, effectively foreshadows Frannie's per sonaljourney, and aids in the uncomfortable atmosphere. Moments of symbolism,including a recurring running bystander on the street, a bride witha cast on her arm, and wordless black-and-white flashbacks to Frannie'sparents ice-skating on the day they got engaged, avoid pretentiousnessand rely on the power of their indelible images and the subtlety ingetting their existential purposes across. The meticulously chosen music also plays a major role in the film,opening with a wistful version of ""Que Sera Sera"" that acts as a cogentcontrast for what is to follow. A beautifully written and acted sequencebetween Frannie and close half-sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh)garners even more humanistic weight with the use of Annie Lennox's""Waiting in Vain."" And the way in which ""I Think I Love You"" playsa disturbing role in a despairing scene near the end is downright ingenious. Enriching Meg Ryan's startling work even more is the support she getsfrom two other supe rb performances by Mark Ruffalo (2003's ""Viewfrom the Top"") and Jennifer Jason Leigh (2002's ""Road to Perdition"").As Detective Malloy, Ruffalo hits every note perfectly in creatingthe right balance between suave, seductive coolness and a more threateningunderlying side. Leigh brings sympathy and a quiet mournfulness toPauline, whose desperate attempts to find her one true love has gottenstalking charges put on her. Although the identity of the killer is unveiled at the climax of ""Inthe Cut,"" it almost comes as a sidenote to the real conflict facingFrannie, whose life has spiraled out of control as a result of herquest for sexual fulfillment and a need for personal purpose in hereveryday life. Throughout the film, Frannie gains further satisfactionby reading the poetry postings on the walls of the subway car. Whatstar ts as a hobby, however, gradually becomes a statement as thelines become intermingled with what is occurring in her own life.It is just another lovely little detail in a motion picture rich withideas, exact characterizations, and visual artistry. ""In the Cut""is a major cinematic achievementsimultaneously heartbreaking, frightening,unpredictable, sexy, grim, provocative and eerily plausible.",In The Cut,R,2003,2.5
462,"In 1990s the author of this review learned the hard way notto expect much from Hollywood blockbusters, especially thosebased on ""high concepts"". One of those, based on the ""SecretService agent must stop super-efficient assassin fromkilling President"", didn't look good, indicating nothingmore than poor man's DAY OF THE JACKAL. However, every nowand then, there comes a pleasant surprise and those ""highconcept"" films turn out much better than expected. IN THELINE OF FIRE, 1993 thriller directed by Wolfgang Petersen,was one of such pleasant surprises.  The protagonist of the film is Frank Horrigan (played byClint Eastwood), Secret Service agent who approachesretirement still haunted by his failure to save PresidentKennedy's life in Dallas three decades ago. A chance ofredemption arises when a routine investigation discoverssomeone who seems quite determined to kill sitting USPresident. That individual (played by John Malkovich)disappears only to start making phone calls to Horrigan inwhich he taunts the old agent with his plan for anotherpresidential assassination. After many unsuccessful attemptsto trace the calls, Horrigan is convinced of assassin'stechnical capability for the act, so he pulls someadministrative strings in order to return to presidentialsecurity detail. This happens in the middle of electioncampaign, and Horrigan is faced with the open animosity byPresident's chief of staff Harry Sargent (played by FredDalton Thompson), man is willing to trade President'ssecurity for broader campaign schedule and extra pollnumbers. As the assassin methodically prepares for the hit,Horrigan desperately tries to find him and in the same timefights the uphill battle against bureacratic superiors whodon't want him on the job.  IN THE LINE OF FIRE has its share of cliches and plot holescharacteristic for ""high concept"" film. It begins with ahighly implausible scene of a Secret Service agent (whoseface had appeared in national media through decades) workingas an undercover agent. The protagonist has a partner,played by Dylan MacDermott, who thinks about retirement, andevery experienced viewer can predict his chances to survivethe film. Of course, presidential security detail alsofeatures a stunningly beautiful woman agent who just happensto fall for the protagonist who could easily be hergrandfather. Rene Russo, who plays that woman, does rathergood job. And, finally, the chief villain, who is supposedto be top professional assassin, just happens to enjoy longphone conversation with the men who are supposed to stop himand thus seriously jeopardise his mission.  But, despite those and some other shortcomings (includingusually monotonous musical score by Ennio Morricone), IN THELINE OF FIRE is more than decent thriller. The main reasonis in Clint Eastwood, whose charismatic presence and old agemake a very convincing protagonist. Another reason is JohnMalkovich, who simply shines in the role that would be everyactor's job - person who wears many different disguises andalso happens to be utter lunatic and cold calculatedprofessional in the same time. Malkovich's talent is suchthat we are able to forget the implausibilities andcontradictions of this character. But the best thing aboutIN THE LINE OF FIRE is its authenticity. Screenwriter JeffMaguire and director Wolfgang Petersen obviously researchedSecret Service very well and the scenes featuring every daydetails of presidential security or the ordinary life inthat law enforcement agency look like they belong todocumentary. Petersen is also very skillful in the use ofCGI and combine actors with documentary footage - first byplanting images of young Eastwood into films depictingDallas in 1963, then by using 1992 Clinton rallies for thescenes of fictional campaign in the film. And, finally, thisfilm does stray from the cliches in its finale - characterof young and sychophantic Agent-in-Charge, played by GaryCole, openly dislikes Horrigan and disregards his securityconcerns, and yet, in the critical moment, he won't allowhis personal bias to stand against his professionalstandards.  All in all, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is way bellow the standardsset by classics like DAY OF THE JACKAL, but it isnevertheless surprisingly good thriller that stands outamong many similar films made in 1990s Hollywood. ",In The Line Of Fire,R,1993,3

Sissy Spacek and TomWilkinson play Ruth and Matt Fowler whose  son (Nick Stahl), an architecturestudent, is fatally shot by the enraged, estranged husband of the much oldersingle mother (Marisa Tomei) he is dating. With the unrepentant killer (WilliamMopother, Tom Cruise's cousin) roaming free on bail in their small town ofCamden in rural Maine, their lives are in torment. First-time writer/directorTodd Fields - who is better known as an actor in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and TV's ""Onceand Again"" - elicits Oscar-caliber performances from his entire cast whileallowing the story to unfold, perhaps slowly, but with sensitive deliberation asMatt, a physician, stifles his outrage as he tries to maintain his practicewhile Ruth, who is furious that her son was ever involved with such aninappropriate woman, continues to lead the school choir. Once a close and lovingcouple, they're burdened with the silence of unsubsiding sorrow and anger asthey're forced to re-examine their relationship not only to each other but to asociety in which criminals can evade legal punishment. The dynamics of theiremotional turmoil are multi-layered, often based in the juxtaposition ofupper-middle class versus working-class values, and this is the type of film youcan see twice, re-hearing the early dialogue as it's tinged with poignant, newmeaning. The title, for example, surfaces first as a description of a trap in alobster boat and then takes on new significance, just as the vengeance theme -after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11th - takes on a realistic relevance. Onthe Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""In the Bedroom"" is an artistic, powerfullyevocative 10 - one of the best pictures of 2001. ",In the Bedroom,R,2001,3.5
464," Old saying about ""life imitating art"" has a rather sinistermeaning for the author of this review. Reason for that is INTHE NAME OF THE FATHER, 1993 film directed by famed Irishdirector Jim Sheridan. Due to some bizarre, hardlybelievable and now totally forgotten circumstances thatdealt with internal politics of his country, the author ofthis review, in rather short, but extremely unpleasantperiod of his life, had to endure the ordeal in somefrightening details similar to the one experienced by themovie protagonist. To make things even more sinister, myordeal had practically coincided with the production of thefilm and later, while IN THE NAME OF FATHER reached Croatiancinemas, I had to wait for the video distribution in orderto come to grips with the dark and traumatic subject of themovie. The most sinister fact remains that this film wasactually based on the true story.  The movie begins in 1974, during the peak of IRA terroristcampaign. Gerry Conlon (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) is ayoung petty thief from Catholic portion of Belfast whodoesn't care about politics, but that doesn't stop him fromgetting into trouble, both with British police and IRA. Inorder to save his life, his estranged father Giuseppe (PetePostlethwaite) sends him to London where Gerry continues hislife of squatting, doing drugs and comitting petty crime. Inthe meantime, IRA bomb exploded in Guilford pub, leavingfive innocent people killed, and police is given broadauthorities in order to bring the perpetrators to justice.For the task force led by Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave),Gerry, his countryman Paul Hill (John Lynch) and couple oftheir friends represent the ideal suspects. They are allarrested, and threatened, harassed and tortured until theyfinally confess the crime they didn't commit. Thatconfession sends not only Gerry to the prison for the restof his life, but his own father is implicated and forced toshare the prison cell with him. At first, Gerry isembittered and full of self-pitty, but seeing the stoicaland moral example of his father, he begins to change andactually fight for his freedom. The defence lawyer GarethPierce (Emma Thompson) begins long legal battle in order tooverturn the conviction.  Although the movie was based on Gerry Conlon'sautobiographical book, and although his premiere coincidedwith the first major breakthrough in Northern Ireland'speace process, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER actually is not thepolitical film in the strictest of sense. The Troubles andreal life tragedy of the innocent people who were caught inthe crossfire serve only as a background for more intimate,universal and apolitical story about two Conlons. Screenplayby Terry George (that actually took many liberties with reallife for dramatic purposes) puts the real emphasis on therelationship between Gerry and his father Giueseppe - andthe great emotional gap between them, the gap that would bebridged under the cruellest of circumstances. Unfortunately,politics does play a role in this film, and in that regard,screenplay is somewhat weaker than when it deals withConlons. Sheridan does indeed give a sense of sad NorthernIreland's reality in a very energetic and powerful riotscene in the beginning, but the rest of this two hour filmbarely rises to that standard. The second part of the film,that actually covers Conlon's prison years, is moreformulaic and sometimes even cliched. The only exception isthe ""fire tears"" scene, but, although powerful, it doesn'tcarry the film.  What actually carries IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER are thesuperb acting perfomances. Daniel Day-Lewis is simplysplendid in the very demanding role of the careless, stupidand unsympathetic youth that actually changes into strong,intelligent crusader for his own cause. But the real gem inthis movie is powerful and unforgettable performance by PetePostlethwaite, character actor whose moving portrayal ofGiuseppe as quiet, simple but morally strong man is actuallyovershadowing Lewis. Other actors are also good, includingEmma Thompson, whose role of defence attorney should havebeen expanded.  The main problem I have with IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,problem that, I must admit, has something to do with myexperience, is in the fact that movie doesn't actuallytackle some important and universal question. For example,story of Gerry Conlon could be used to illustrate how frailare such noble concepts like ""human rights"" and ""dueprocess"" even in countries that pride themselves withcenturies of democratic standards. It could also illustratehow powerless individual can be when he is picked byall-powerful state, and that, under the certaincircumstances, even the Western democracies can be as meantowards the people as totalitarian regimes. IN THE NAME OFFATHER, by concentrating mostly on an interesting, but in aglobal scale rather local issue of Northern Ireland, and onother level, personal issue of Conlons, failed to exploresuch areas. Which is pitty, because this film, althoughstill being good, had capacity to be really great. ",In the Name of the Father,R,1994,2.5
465,"Well, here's a depressing motion picture, an action-comedy so deadeningin its absence of charm and humor that it has to be seen to be believed.But heed my very serious warning: do not, under any circumstances,subject yourself to this monumental waste of time and celluloid. Ever-so-slightlyturning on a faucet and watching the water drip would be time muchbetter spent than suffering through ""The In-Laws."" Loosely based on the 1979 feature of the same name, thankfully unseenby me and starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin, ""The In-Laws"" is a thoroughlyuneasy amalgamation of action movie and comedic farce with littlein the way of even narrative cohesion. To say that it is devoid ofany excitement or laughs would only be overstating by the very naturethat there was a single chuckle elicited from the otherwise wastedbright performance by Emmy Laybourne (1999's ""Superstar""), as a drunken bridesmaid. With lovebirds Melissa (Lindsay Sloane) and Mark (Ryan Reynolds) preparingto be married, they naturally want their parents to meet and get acquaintedwith each other. Enter Melissa's father, uptight pediatrist JerryPeyser (Albert Brooks), and Mark's aloof dad, Steve Tobias (MichaelDouglas). Before they have even had time to have dinner together,Jerry discovers that Steve is an international spy for the CIA. WithJerry knowing too much, he unwillingly becomes involved in Steve'scurrent operation, an attempt to smuggle over $100-million from crookedarms dealer Jean-Pierre Thibodoux (David Suchet). To say the least,it increasingly appears that Melissa and Mark's wedding will not begoing off without a few major hitches. Directed by the usually reliable Andrew Fleming (1999's ""Dick""), ""TheIn-Laws"" is a veritable disaster any way you shake a stick at it.The movie starts off shakily, with a violent chase sequence that feelsterribly out of place, and then devolves into an embarrassing mixtureof amazingly lame jokes that are supposed to make the viewer laughand action scenes that wouldn't pass muster in a schlocky, direct-to-videoJean-Claude Van Damme picture. A stream of stereotypical gay jokesfly left and right, the desperate source for much of the so-calledcomedy as they slam instantly against the pavement and set back thegay pride movement by about fifty years. The mere plotting of thepremise is even more ill-conceived, if that is at all possible. In the middle of the commotion is odd couple Jerry and Steve, unpleasantindividual made even more spiteful by being placed together. Whileboth guys are supposed to mean well, and do love their children, theyare like big babies who don't seem to care about anyone but themselves.As international spy Steve, Michael Douglas (2003's ""It Runs in theFamily"") proves that either he is not made for comedy or simply wasn'tgiven anything funny to work with (I suspect it is both). And as thetight-collared Jerry, even marvelously talented comedian Albert Brookshas somehow been rendered laugh-free, without a chance to deliverany of his usually dry and biting one-liners. The rest of the cast is left up the stream without a paddle, prancingin and out of scenes as they mimic kindergarten-drawn stick figureswithout any emotional resonance or character depth. As engaged coupleMelissa and Mark, Lindsay Sloane (2000's ""Bring It On"") and Ryan Reynolds(2002's ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"") are asked to look frazzledand not much else. They share no chemistry with each other, nor arethey given a chance to, so the question of whether the wedding isgoing to occur makes no difference to the viewer. As Steve's bitterex-wife, Judy, Candice Bergen (2003's ""View from the Top"") has even less to do.  The only character with any possible potential is Steve's partner,Angela, a vivacious and tough young rookie with an obvious crush onher mentor. Played by the talented Robin Tunney (2000's ""Supernova""),writer-director Andrew Fleming nonsensically betrays her in the climaxwith an out-of-left-field twist that would have been utterly enraginghad it not been inevitable. Since Fleming had managed to screw upevery other element of this project, it only made sense for him toseal the deal with Tunney's Angela. ""The In-Laws"" is unredeemable filmmaking, an unfunny, egotistical,idiotic dead-zone of a movie with nary a glimpse of energy or genuineheart. It does not care about its characters or its story and, inresponse, the viewer is left with nothing to do but seethe at justhow offensively bad what they are watching is. Even the soundtrack,filled with some otherwise really good classic tunes, is grotesquelyedited into the scenes with no sense of timing or fluidity. How ""TheIn-Laws"" got greenlit is one of this year's most confounding cinematic mysteries.","In-Laws, The",PG-13,2003,1.5
466,"      Okay, I realize that my fellow critics are giving thumbs down toINDEPENDENCE DAY (ID4), but I absolutely love it.  Although not aspretentious nor as good STAR WARS, which is the show it most closelyresembles, ID4 is the best action and sci-fi thriller I have seen in along time.  It has devastation on a scale that is unmatched by any showI have ever seen, and yet the film is so controlled that kids as youngas 7 should be able to see it and enjoy it as well as the adults.       Since we were scared by the newspaper stories of the long lines atID4, we went on Saturday afternoon to see PHENOMENON instead.  When wegot there, the projector had broken so went over to ID4 where therewere long lines and people with umbrellas and ice chests waiting in theheat of the parking lot.  To our surprise, most of these people werecoming early to buy tickets for later.  We bought tickets 10 minutes inadvance for the 5:25 show in one of the three theaters showing ID4 andgot almost our favorite seats - in the center 10 rows from the screen.       I will only setup the plot and give some of the dialog so you canget a flavor of the show, but without giving anything away.  Alienscome in a huge planetary size home that is one quarter the diameter ofthe moon.  From their home they dispatch a dozen spaceships that arefifteen miles wide.  When these spaceships go overhead they are solarge they eclipse the sun forming dark ominous shadows over entirecities.  Moreover, they look like flying visions of hell complete withfiery clouds that portend the end of the world.       Hollywood of late has two types of picture presidents.  One set ofmovies has presidents who are AWOL as in EXECUTIVE DECISION and BROKENARROW.  The other set are paeans to Bill Clinton as in THE AMERICANPRESIDENT.  Here for a change we have ex-fighter pilot President ThomasWhitmore (Bill Pullman from WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING and RUTHLESSPEOPLE) who is a reserved version of Teddy Roosevelt.  Although he isabout Clinton's age, pilot Whitmore is clearly not a Clinton clone asDouglas was in THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, and there is even a hint in themovie that he is actually a Republican.  I liked Pullman's performance.He is believably concerned for all of his people, and althoughnaturally a quite type, he is not afraid to lead and make toughdecisions.       Jeff Goldblum plays the nerd role of satellite engineer and chiefcode cracker David Levinson.  David's ex-wife Connie (Margaret Colin)is the Chief-of-Staff to the president.  Judd Hirsch is David's fatherJulius.  Julius is full of funny homilies as when he tells his son tocalm down on the drive to the capital, ""What's the rush?  You thinkwe'll get to Washington, and it won't be there?""  Working in the TVstation with David is Marty Gilbert (Harvey Fierstein).  When he learnsthat the aliens are on the way, he advises David as he is running tothe bomb shelter, ""There is no shame in hiding,"" and then reflects,  ""Ibetter call my mother.""       California is not treated with much respect in the movie.  AsCaptain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) and his girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow(Vivica Fox) are waking up, an alien ship is passing overhead whichmakes their bed shake.  Steve asks, ""Is that an earthquake?""  Jasminereassures him with, ""not even a four pointer.  Go back to sleep.""After this is one of many great comedic scenes in the picture.  Stevewalks outside and looks right noticing his neighbor is leaving and thenas he looks all around he gets wide eyed realizing that everybody isleaving.  When he figures out what is going on, he tries to reassureJasmine with, ""Look, I don't think that they flew 90 billionlight-years here to start a fight.""       The people in LA are excited about the aliens coming.  This istheir kind of event.  One undulates in rapture, ""Oh god, I hope theybring back Elvis.""  A California teenager uses the come-on line to agirl in his pickup truck, ""This may be your last night on earth.  Doyou want it to be as a virgin?""       The serious lines are given to the president.  He holds a newsconference to proclaim, ""the question of whether we are alone in theuniverse has been answered.""  The answer, of course, is troubling.Later he tells the world that, ""we can't be consumed by our pettydifferences anymore.""       Even more than the funny script by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerichand the precise and energetic direction by Roland Emmerich, what makesthe show burst with excitement are the special effects.  The power andthe scale of the effects outdoes the death star in STAR WARS and thetornadoes in TWISTER.  Actually the picture has aspects of these shows,plus many others (TESTAMENT, TOP GUN, BLADE RUNNER, DR. STRANGELOVE,etc.), but is never derivative.  Everything here fills fresh, and yetat its heart this is a classic sci-fi tale from the 50s.       Okay, now is the time to address the plausibility issue.  If afilm is good enough, you can ignore a lot of unlikely material.  Upuntil the solution is found to combat the alien invasion, I found thestory reasonably believable.  After that it became a bit tougher tosuspend disbelieve, but, hey, this is not a National Geographic specialafterall.       The hellish colors that cinematographer Karl Walter Lindenlaubcomes up with work great.  The score by David Arnold is dramatic, andit is probably worth buying the CD of it.       My favorite actors in the show are Will Smith and Bill Pullman.The first is hilarious and smart, and the second wise and brave.  For agreat little quirky character Randy Quaid plays crop duster RussellCasse who claims to have been captured by aliens ten years earlier.Watch how the writers tie that in with the rest of the story.  Manyother good minor characters including Robert Loggia as General Grey,Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore, Brent Spiner as mad Dr.Okun, and James Rebhorn as Secretary of Defense Nimziki.  Finally, theending is phenomenal.       INDEPENDENCE DAY runs 2:22, and I am glad they did not trim itdown to make more money.  It is rated PG-13.  The amazing thing to mewas that I could have safely taken my 7 year old son Jeffrey to see it.There is violence, but it is all of the non-threatening sci-fi variety.If your kids can handle balls of flames and cars blowing up and if theyare not frightened at all by Star Wars, they are probably old enough tosee INDEPENDENCE DAY.  My guess is that most kids 7 and up will love itas I did.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad language that I canremember.  I give this enjoyable and incredible film my strongestrecommendation and top rating of ****.  I don't care what the othercritics that I respect say.  This is a great film, and I am happy to bepushing it.  ",Independence Day,PG-13,1996,3
467,"In early 1990s Sean Penn toyed with the idea of quitting the acting business and continuing his movie career behind the camera. First attempt in that direction was his 1991 drama THE INDIAN RUNNER.  The plot deals with two brothers from small Midwestern town. Joe Roberts (played by David Morse) had taken a job of deputy sheriff in order to provide for his family. He is forced to kill a youth in self-defence on the very day his brother Frank (played by Viggo Mortensen) is returning from Vietnam. This incident, very traumatic for Joe, is a sign of things to come because two brothers are complete opposites of each other. While Joe always tried to do the right thing, be dedicated family man and responsible member of society, Frank had been a victim of his violent temper and often ended in jail. Years later Frank is leaving jail and Joe meets his girlfriend Dorothy (played by Rosanna Arquette). Determined to set his brother straight once and for all, Joe takes Frank into his house, gets him a job, helps him start a family and tries to keep him out of trouble. But some characters don't change and the tragedy is unavoidable.  Penn claimed that he had found inspiration for this film in Bruce Springsteen's song ""Highway Patrolman"". More cynical observers would say that Penn could have found inspiration in his own life, particularly brawls with photojournalists and other incidents that had brought him notoriety during the first stages of his career. Penn probably saw THE INDIAN RUNNER as a way to prove himself as something more than tabloid fodder. The film indeed shows the mark of an emerging talent, especially in the way Penn (who doesn't appear in front of camera) allows his fellow actors to exploit their abilities. THE INDIAN RUNNER has plenty of very diverse acting talents that use diverse acting styles and create powerful performance. Although David Morse and Viggo Mortensen dominate the screen, the viewers would probably be very impressed with the appearance of Charles Bronson, here in very unusual role of old Roberts. Unfortunately, Penn in this film also showed typical beginner's mistake of being too much in love with his first movie and not using editor's scissors as much as he could. The movie is at least thirty minutes longer than it should be and the utter seriousness of the theme and tone of THE INDIAN RUNNER makes the viewing experience almost unbearable at times. The film failed but it wasn't such a tragedy for Penn or for the audience. Following this, Penn decided to continue acting and therefore provided the audience with some truly remarkable roles in 1990s. ","Indian Runner, The",R,1991,
468,"Time can be very unkind to movies. In first few months andyears after the premiere, a movie might make record profitsat the box-office, earn multitudes of ""Oscars"" and generallybe regarded as one of the greatest contemporary films. But,only after few years that same film gets utterly forgotten,and future film scholars have a lot of trouble in explainingits initial success. 1980s blockbusters seem to be very goodillustration of this phenomenon, and not even George Lucasand Steven Spielberg, those two symbols of blockbustersuccess, could save their films from such fate. INDIANAJONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, their second instalment invery popular adventure film trilogy, directed by StevenSpielberg in 1984, is a good example - a very popular andcritically hailed film in its time, and now virtuallydespised by contemporary critics, misunderstood by thecontemporary audience and practically disowned by their owncreators.  INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is product of its era,albeit somewhat unusual one. When screenwriter and producerGeorge Lucas begun working on the follow-up to his classicadventure masterpiece RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, he decided tomake prequel instead of sequel and set the plot in Shanghai1935, one year before the events of the first film.Archaeology professor Indiana Jones (played by HarrisonFord) has located the remains of the first Manchu emperorand he comes to luxurious night-club to complete the dealwith local gang boss Lao Che (played by Roy Liao). He is toreceive precious diamond in the exchange for the artefact,but the deal goes bad and in the ensuing chaos he would haveto settle with clueless bar singer Willie Scott (played byKate Capshaw). Pursued by Lao Che's gangsters, they get tothe taxi driven by 9-year old Short Round (played byJonathan Ke Quan) who takes them to airport where they allthree would board plane for India. The flight is not the endof adventure - plane crashes in the Himalaya mountains andtrio, barely escaping death, has to travel to Delhi. On theway they reach small impoverished Indian village and thelocal shaman (played by D.R. Nanayakkara) tells them aboutevil Thugee cult whose minions took away the sacred Shankarastone and all the children. Jones agrees to help them andthe trail lead him to Pankot Palace, place which used toshelter Thugess many centuries ago but now seems to be ruledby benevolent child Maharaja (played by Raj Singh) and hisOxford-educated prime minister Chattar Lal (played by RoshanSeth). Jones is still suspicious and soon he finds secretpassages that lead to the cave which was recently turnedinto temple of goddess Kali and where the evil chief priestMola Ram (played by Amrish Puri) wants to gather all theShankara stone and thus get the magical power that wouldenable him to rule the world.  Like many sequels of its era, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLEOF DOOM had misfortune of being compared with itspredecessor, and in most of such cases predecessors happenedto be much better. In the case of this film predecessor wasRAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, not only the first instalment intrilogy intended to repeat the success of STAR WARS, butalso an undisputed classic of adventure genre. Lucas andSpielberg were aware of this and they tried very hard tomake second instalment of the series as different aspossible from the first. They succeeded in that but thosechanges weren't necessarily for the better and INDIANA JONESAND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is almost universally viewed as muchinferior to the first film of the trilogy.  The most palpable change is in the screenplay, this timewritten by Wilard Huyk and Gloria Katz. While the first filmhad very basic, but still coherent plot, the second one isnothing more than the series of action sequences and gagsloosely sawn together. Characterisation is even worse,except in the case of Indiana Jones. His character has beenclearly established in the first part and screenwritersactually don't need to experiment, but short episode withhis turning to the Dark Side seems refreshing. Harrison Fordplays him very well, being equally convincing in tuxedo andhis legendary adventurer's outfit. Unfortunately, this isnot the case with his partners. Character of weak, stupidand utterly useless female partner Willie Scott representsspectacular departure from the high standards set forIndiana Jones' girl in the first film. Her constantcomplaining, crying and screaming is funny at first butlater gets repetitive and irritating; Kate Capshaw might bethe best actress around but she can't remedy the limits ofher character, which seems insulting to the female gender ingeneral, despite being modelled as a parody of dumb blondeand damsel in distress stereotypes in 1930s movies. Bond's9-year old sidekick Short Round looks much better incomparison, although his character has opportunities to beequally irritating. He was probably introduced to the filmin order to make it more attractive to the younger audiences- those who were basis of Spielberg's commercial success in1980s.  Unfortunately, Spielberg, in his effort to make this filmappealing to adolescent and pre- adolescent crowds succumbsto infantilism that plagued many 1980s films. So, one childamong protagonists is not enough and the film must havevillains that use thousands of children for the slavelabour, sacrificing plausibility in the process. Suchinfantilism, that plagued many films made in the mid 1980s(like MAD MAX BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME), is compromised withthe heavy use of realistic violence. If spiders, bugs,snakes, skeletons and decomposing bodies don't scare thechildren in the theatres, people being ripped to pieces andburned alive, all with appropriate amounts of blood andgore, definitely would. Even the 1980s MPAA censors wereaware of this, and Spielberg used all his clout to createcompromise PG-13 rating that managed to save at least partof his core audience. Of course, MPAA censors were, asusual, more squeamish about sex than violence, so Spielbergreduced eroticism for couple of weak double entendres,leaving critics to interpret the Freudian meaning of thetunnels that play important part in the second part of thefilm.  Screenplay was weaker than the previous film, but at leastSpielberg kept his directing skills. From the opening, thatpays homage to 1930s musicals, to the end, movie is seriesof excellent scenes. The action is always exciting andrhythm very fast, never allowing the film the slow down;which is perhaps a good thing, because characterisation andplot problems would otherwise become even more obvious.Photography of Douglas Slocombe creates good atmosphere, andthe production design in Pinewood studios is superb, as wellas Sri Lanka locations (which some of us might recognisefrom THE BRIDGE AT THE RIVER KWAI). Special effects are alsovery good and still look convincing, despite being made withpre-CGI technology. Music by John Williams is very good, andalthough not being particularly memorable (except in theritual scene), serves as perfect illustration for the eventsin film.  There is another reason why INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OFDOOM enjoys much worse reputation today than sixteen yearsago. All the villains in the film happen to be non-white,and even in 1984 British satirical show SPITTING IMAGEaccused this film for racism in a parody gag calledXENOPHOBIA JONES. We could only imagine how would PC policeof contemporary Hollywood react to the similar script today.Because of that, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM seemsquite refreshing compared with contemporary action andadventure films. Spielberg is also one of the rare Hollywoodfilmmakers who defies stereotypical negative portrayal ofthe British Empire in historical films. This film not onlyfeatures British colonial troops in the role reserved for USCavalry in early westerns, but also references certain goodthings the Empire did for its subjects.  All in all, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is deeplyflawed film that didn't age quite well, but most of thoseflaws are well hidden by Spielberg's mastery. From ourperspective it is still a very good piece of Hollywoodentertainment, much superior to the more recent examples ofsame genre. ",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,PG,1984,2.5

Whistle-blowerJeffrey Wigand, former head of research and development at Brown &Williamson, was a corporate officer, the ultimate insider on theskullduggery involved in the business of selling tobacco. His firingcomes to the attention of Mike Wallace's producer, Lowell Bergman, whoconvinces the reluctant scientist to spill the beans on 60 Minutes,only to have the interview killed by CBS's corporate lawyer who citesa confidentiality agreement the executive signed with the tobaccocompany. Three months later, after the Wall Street Journal printedWigand's allegations, 60 Minutes aired the segment. So much forfiasco. It's the Oscar-caliber performances that command attention,primarily the emotional relationship between Russell Crowe, as theconflicted Wigand, and Al Pacino, as the tenacious Bergman. Ajournalist hasn't shown this much righteous indignation since All thePresident's Men. Christopher Plummer deserves a Best Supporting Actornod as Wallace, who with Philip Baker Hall, as producer Don Hewitt,come across as cowards, bowing to management on ethics, leaving theirsource, Wigand, hanging in the wind.

470,"INSOMNIA, the second major film by Christopher Nolan, is a most ironicmovie -- but not in the way you might expect.  After making one ofthe most unconventional thrillers in motion picture history (MEMENTO),Nolan decided to remake the quite unusual 1997 Norwegian film INSOMNIA,which starred Stellan SkarsgÎrd.  The irony is that Nolan's versionis a completely conventional, big budget Hollywood thriller filledwith star power, including Oscar winners Al Pacino (SCENT OF A WOMAN),Hilary Swank (BOYS DON'T CRY) and Robin Williams (GOOD WILL HUNTING). I expected Nolan to magnify the original's unconventional aspects,not to diminish them.  Don't get me wrong, the result is solid entertainmentfrom start to finish, but it is certainly nothing worth putting onbest of the year lists as MEMENTO definitely was.  (MEMENTO was my top pick last year.) Basically a one man picture, it stars Al Pacino as Will Dormer, acop who can't get enough sleep.  Both versions of INSOMNIA were setin a land where the sun never sets in summer.  This time the actionhappens in a breathtaking Alaska.  Dormer and his L.A. detective partner,played by Martin Donovan (HOLLOW REED), have been sent way up northto help investigate the murder of a teenage girl.  Although it maynot appear to be the work of a serial killer, Will says that he thinksthat other murders will follow.  Probably the best part of the originalwas the way that insomnia dominated the entire story; with SkarsgÎrdmaking it so palpable that you began to feel downright woozy.  Thistime, the impact of the insomnia isn't really emphasized until close to the end.   Hilary Swank plays Ellie Burr, a cop who has worshiped Will from afarand is happy to tag along in this investigation.  Before this murder,she has been assigned to nothing but misdemeanors.  Since Will issomething of a Sherlock Holmes, with a dash of Serpico thrown in tospice up the mix, Ellie is elated about watching the master in action. Robin Williams plays Walter Finch, a local writer who was a friendof the murdered girl.  His performance is effective but a tad bland. The tense and atmospheric film has plenty of twists, although manyof them are easy to guess.  The treat is watching veteran actor Pacinoat work.  There aren't many like him.  As you leave, however, you'lllikely be thinking more of Nolan than Pacino and hoping that Nolanreturns to his unconventional roots for his next picture. INSOMNIA runs 1:55.  It is rated R for ""language, some violence andbrief nudity"" and would be acceptable for most teenagers.",Insomnia,R,2002,3.5
471," Violence has become a negative catch-word recently, so it'srefreshing to see how the concept is explored in this psychologicalthriller, based on Daniel Quinn's book ""Ismael."" Anthony Hopkins playsa highly respected primatologist who has been jailed for killing twoRwandan rangers and injuring others after choosing to live in the wildwith mountain gorillas for nearly two years. Held captive in anovercrowded maximum security prison for the criminally insane, he isinterrogated by a bright, ambitious psychiatrist, Cuba Gooding Jr.,who is eager to understand the mysterious truth behind the scientist'sactions in anticipation of writing a best-seller. While simplistic,Gerald DiPego's script is intelligent and thoughtful, delving into theconcepts of illusion and freedom, combined with the lust fordomination and control, ultimately dividing people into ""givers"" and""takers."" Director Jon Turtletaub (""Phenomenon"") integrates the brutalreality of prison life with memories of what transpired in Africa tomotivate Hopkins' violent behavior. The challenging, combativechemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. is palpable,escalating the tension level, which is already elevated by the hostilesadism of the prison's guards and warden. But a subplot involvingMaura Tierney as Hopkins' daughter never jells, and the conclusion iscloyingly melodramatic. Arguably the most versatile and talented actoron the screen today, Anthony Hopkins evokes a volatile power and furyreminiscent of Hannibal Lechter in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" whileCuba Gooding Jr. displays a forceful, bruising intensity. Andspecial-effects wizard Stan Winston works wonders with thegorillas. On the Granger Movie Gauge, ""Instinct"" is a compelling 7,commanding attention from start to finish. ",Instinct,R,1999,2
472,"In many European languages phrase ""internal affairs"" is used forgovernment departments dealing with national security, lawenforcement and similar police work. In USA same phrase is usedfor similar organisations, but on much lower level -specialiseddivisions that deal with corruption and similar abuses of powerwithin various law enforcement agencies. Since the issues ofpolice corruption tend to evade black-and-white vision of the worldand the investigations, even those successful, leave bitter taste ofmouth, policemen chasing other policemen were as popularamong Hollywood filmmakers as among real life policemen. One ofrare movies that dealt with this subject is INTERNAL AFFAIRS,1990s thriller that happened to be American debut of famousBritish director Mike Figgis.  Protagonist of this film is Raymond Avilla (played by Andy Garcia),ambitious young policeman who has just joined Internal AffairsDivision of LAPD and is blissfully unaware of the emotional toll hewould have to pay for success in his new career. First hint comeswhen he happens to investigate his old friend Van Stretch (playedby William Baldwin), patrolman who turned into human wreck afterconsuming too much of illegally seized drugs. Soon Avilla'sattention turns to Van's partner, friend and mentor Dennis Peck(played by Richard Gere) whose willingness to remain uniformedstreet policeman seems conspicuous, as well as rich lifestyleincompatible with ordinary policeman's salary. Avilla and hispartner Amy Wallace (played by Laurie Metcalf) begininvestigation, determined to expose Peck and his cabal of corruptcops, but this task seems harder than both of them had imagined.Peck is not only well-connected within police and on the street; heis totally ruthless and he would stop at nothing in order to preventInternal Affairs from finding any compromising evidence. But thebest way to stop Avilla is by discovering his soft spot in the form ofAvila's young, beautiful and recently much neglected wifeKathleen (played by Nancy Travis).  INTERNAL AFFAIRS is a movie that should be remembered mostlyfor two things, but none of them has much to do with Henry Bean'sscript that failed to explore social, ethical, racial, ethnic andpolitical angles offered by this potentially intriguing subject. Whatwe are left is rather formulaic 1980s cop story about goodpoliceman that defies odds in order to bring down evil andseemingly all-powerful crime lord (who just happens to be anotherpoliceman). What saves this film is excellent performance byRichard Gere who uses rare opportunity to play villain and does itwith gusto. Dennis Peck is therefore one of the most memorablevillains in history of cinema - someone who is intelligent,manipulative, almost childishly immoral and chillingly ruthless andin the same time able to present himself as loving father andhusband. Gere's performance managed to overshadow the rest ofthe cast, starting with Andy Garcia who tried very hard to bringdarker dimension to his seemingly flawless character. Some minorplayers stand out, though, including Laurie Metcalf who broughtsome dignity to otherwise thankless role of lesbian detective. Thedirection by Mike Figgis is very good - British director obviouslyenjoyed opportunity to shoot in sunny California and his effortsrepresent the triumph of style over substance. Almost anycharacter in this film looks like fashion model, they all live inluxurious houses, drive expensive cars, wear fashionable clothesand enjoy lifestyle worthy of Hollywood royalty. But Figgis doesn'tbother with lengthy explanations (and never answers how Mexicanpoliceman from low background hooked up with wealthy andrefined WASP girl played by Nancy Travis) and actually uses thisvisual glamour to make effective contrast with almost surreallevels of corruption depicted in this film. The abrupt, althoughrather predictable ending, leaves much to be desired, butINTERNAL AFFAIRS is still very interesting, stylish and in manyways entertaining film that didn't deserve to sink into oblivion. ",Internal Affairs,R,1990,3
473,"The question, ""Where were you when the Towers were hit"" hassupplanted the query, ""Where were you when President Kennedywas assassinated, yet the latter conversation piece may prove tobe the more lasting one.  Of the major events during the past 90years: the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand which led toWorld War I; the bombing of Hiroshima which changed the natureof major-power diplomacy; the murder of President Kennedy,which led to a protracted period of investigations on its motive andnature of the crime; and the disaster at Twin Towers, which wasthe first assault by a foreign enemy on one of the fifty states since1815 the Kennedy tragedy lingers largely because manyAmericans and possibly most Europeans disbelieve the WarrenCommission Report that a lone individual, and not a conspiracy,was involved.     Neil Burger's low-budget ""Interview with the Assassin,"" whichlooks like a documentary feature and is probably designed toemulate talking-heads yarns, is pure fiction but has the ring ofemotional truth to those who reject the idea that the investigationis closed.  Though not really purporting to support the conspiracytheory, Burger suggests that in addition to Lee Harvey Oswald, ahandful of others who were not politically motivated had a hand infiring the fatal shot to the ex-president's head, the one thatactually killed him.  Resembling in large part the template of ""TheBlair Witch Project,"" which for reasons unknown to me became amajor hit and a breakthrough in cinematic treatment of the horrortheme, ""Interview"" focuses primarily on two performers; RaymondJ. Barry in the role of the 62-year-old Walter Ohlinger, and DylanHaggerty, who acts the part of news photographer Ron Kobeleski.     When Kobeleski in called over by his California neighborbecause he wanted to make a confession before his expecteddeath from cancer in about six months, the photographer is at firstshocked, and then drawn into the older man's tale, particularlysince Walter sounds convincing enough and emphatically statesthat he has proof that he first the second shot while standingbehind a fence at the grassy knoll near the Dallas book storagebuilding.  Accompanying Walter to Dallas, Ron watches Walterrecreate the shooting, signs up for a couple of guns for his newfriend who fears being killed by those who'd be privy to theconfession, and ends up in Washington, DC. where a surprise isin store for the interviewer.     Neil Burger confirms that while his script appears improvised, itis in fact tightly written and that he put a hundred actors throughan audition for the lead role before he found the man who wouldstrike the right note.  What Burger was obviously looking for was aguy who could project to the photographer and to the movieaudience the ambiguity: is Walter a mentally unstable fellowlooking for notoriety before he dies (if indeed he has cancer at all),or is he actually the perpetrator who could prove the WarrenCommission to be seriously flawed?       The film, however, is so Blair-ish, so lacking in drama, that itlooks like something that might be shown on cable during the weehours of the morning.  The night scenes are dark, shown throughwhat looks like a laser-equipped instrument that could detectmovement in the dark while not calling attention to itself. Raymond J. Barry, who has appeared in several major films like""Dead Man Walking"" and ""Unmarried Woman,"" does convey theambiguity that will have the audience leaving the theaterdiscussing the veracity of his claims, but ""Interview"" is the sort ofwork better seen on TV than on the big screen. ",Interview With The Assassin,NR,2002,2.5
474,"The burgeoning filmmaking path the Coen brotherswriter Ethan and co-writer/directorJoelhave strived for since 1996's ""Fargo,"" one of the best films ofthat decade, has eluded them. While 1998's ""The Big Lebowski"" wasmildly amusing and 2000's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" was more popularfor its wildly successful bluegr ass soundtrack than the film itself,most of the Coen brothers' recent big-screen endeavors have been majordisappointments. Perhaps motion pictures as original and all-aroundbrilliant as ""Fargo"" only come around once for most filmmakers. Whateverthe case may be, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" is a shallow and instantlyforgettable non-romantic comedy, a new cinematic low point for Joel and Ethan Coen.Miles Massey (George Clooney) is the best divorce lawyer in town,a wealthy hotshot who wins cases through swindles and lies. MarilynRexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a venemous gold-digger who marriesrich men with wandering eyes, arranges to catch them in the act, andthen walks away with half their assets in divorce court. When Milesis hired to defend her latest victim, soon-to-be-ex-husband Rex Rexroth(Edward Herrmann), it puts him in direct contact with Marilyn, a temptingforce-of-nature whom he is uncontrollably drawn to despite knowinghe probably shouldn't be. Following the divorce of her third husband,oil tycoon Howard D. Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton), Miles lets his feelingsfor Marilyn be known. Now all he has to do is ensure that her reciprocalfeelings for him are genuine, and not just a part of her latest con.Unlike the Coen brothers' usual oeuvre, this time they have pairedup on the screenplay with fellow team Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone(2002's ""Big Trouble""). Four screenwriters involved in one projectis rarely a good sign, usually resulting in a troubled creative tug-of-war.Whether this is the case or not, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" has all ofthe makings of such a problem. The finished product is severely unevenand the dialogue hyperstylized and unnatural.The romance between Miles and Marilyn is hindered in the process.Whereas the characters of Marge Gunderson and Jerry Lundegaard in""Fargo"" were filled with humanity and given the chance to live andbreathe as real people, Miles and Marilyn are strictly one-dimensionalscreenwriting creations whose every line of dialogue is directly relatedto the plot. Without any apparent hobbies or interests outside oftheir money-obsessed schemes, they share no plausible connection outsideof basic physical attraction. Why does Miles fall for Marilyn in thefirst place? And why does Marilyn react by grappling with her crookedconscience? Because without them, there would be no story to tell.As it is, the story at hand isn't exactly one that needed to be toldin the first place. As intentionally nasty and meanspirited as Milesand Marilyn are, director Joel Coen betrays even these failed intentionsin the final act by attempting to grow them hearts when it is so obviousthey have none. These last-minute pleads for audience sympathy areunconvincing at best, and woefully misguided at worst.George Clooney (2002's ""Solaris"") and Catherine Zeta-Jones (2002's""Chicago"") are impossibly gorgeously movie stars who have never lookedbetter than they do here. In a film that might have given them likable,or at least interesting, characters to portray, this talented paircould have really sizzled. Mark things down as a missed opportunity,then, as Clooney and Zeta-Jones wade through paper-thin characterizationsand stilted dialogue. We never believe for a second that they arefalling in love, and so the picture's entire reason for being is admonished.Some of the supporting roles are a little brighter, if no more developed,with Paul Adelstein (2000's ""Bedazzled"") as Miles' overly sentimentalassistant Wrigley, Billy Bob Thornton (2001's ""Monster's Ball""), asone of Marilyn's conned husbands, and Cedric the Entertainer (2002's""Barbershop"") as tabloid photographer Gus Petch, showing the most promise.As ill-advised and emotionally static as most of ""Intolerable Cruelty""is, fleeting moments of comedic inspiration manage to shine through.Marilyn's wedding to Doyle, with vows written as if they were seafarers,and a truly unfortunate mistake concerning a gun and an asthma inhalerare funny enough scenes to make you briefly forget how hateful thefilm is and how far Joel and Ethan Coen have fallen in the seven yearssince ""Fargo."" Mostly though, you are forced to watch despicable peopledoing things you simply don't care about for 100 minutes. The crueltythese characters inhabit may, indeed, be intolerable, but so is this movie.",Intolerable Cruelty,PG-13,2003,2
475,"""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is an interesting, intelligentlyscripted film, particularly for a 1950s horror film.  However, the melodramatic score, heavy-handed direction and hammy acting make it more of a comedy than it was intended to be.  The plot has a Dr. Binnell arriving to town after a vacationand encountering a rash of people claiming that their relativesare no longer themselves.  Later, these same people recant.Gradually, Binnell comes to believe that these people arecontrolled by aliens and that they are after him as well.  This film asks the questions: What if the people closest to youwere suddenly different.  What if they had some secret and evilplan?  What if they wanted you to join them, even against yourwill?  While the plot has these people's bodies possessed byalien pods from outer space, the screenplay may be a thinlydisguised jab at cold war paranoia in the U.S., and the general belief that communists were around every corner and out to subvert the country.  Since screenwriters as well as actorswere blacklisted (see Woody Allen's ""The Front"") and livedin fear of losing their jobs during the cold war, any protestthat a screenwriter made would have to be between the lines.  The ""pod people"" in this film don't act like the controlled zombies you would expect them to be, except in the group scenes.  Takenone by one, they just seem to be bad tempered.  Often theyact quite human.  More consistency for ""pod people"" behaviorwould have been an improvement, as well as greater contrastin personalities between those converted and those still alive.  Binnell, who has somehow remained single and unattached all theseyears, meets old flame Becky Driscoll, also unattached.They are a couple for the rest of the film.  This begs thequestions: Why does a sci-fi flick have to have a love interestsubplot?  Why can't Binnell and Becky be cast as happilymarried rather than just reunited long lost lovers?Is a relationship only considered interesting if it is brand new?  The studio wanted to soften the ending of the ""Invasion ofthe Body Snatchers"", so the put additional scenes at the beginningand end of the film.  It can be argued that tampering withthe director's concept ruins the film, but a three minutescene added to an eighty minute film cannot significantlyaffect its grade.  Petty criticisms aside, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" isa good and original film that successfully explores theparanoia that sometimes lurks within us all. ",Invasion Of The Body Snatchers,NR,1956,3
476,"      ""My brother and I were born strangers.""  The bittersweet dramaINVENTING THE ABBOTTS chronicles the coming of age of two brothers,Doug and Jacey Holt, played with touching sincerity by Joaquin Phoenix(TO DIE FOR) and Billy Crudup (SLEEPERS).  Set in 1957 in Haley,Illinois, the show is reminiscent of several old movies, but the storyremains fresh and relevant.       Doug has fewer social graces than his slightly older brotherJacey.  Doug will try anything, including painting on fake sideburns,to impress the girls.  Jacey, on the other hand, attracts femalecompanionship like honey attracts flies.  As much as they profess theirdifferences, they are remarkably similar in looks and tastes.       The boys are bound together in a close knit family run by theirgrade school teaching mother, Helen.  Kathy Baker plays the widow witha natural grace.  Her husband died during a childish bit of bravadobefore Doug was born.  Baker's minor, but crucial, role has its biggestimpact in a small revelation scene at the dinner table.       Although the story centers on the boys, equally interesting arethe girls who live in the town's mansion.  Jennifer Connelly(MULHOLLAND FALLS) plays the middle sister Eleanor Abbott, Liv Tyler(THAT THING YOU DO) is her younger sister Pamela, and Joanna Going(WYATT EARP) is her older sister Alice.       Jennifer Connelly gives a strong performance as the sexuallypromiscuous sister.  She unabashedly loves sex and views sleepingaround to be as natural as eating.  Her no-holds-barred role evenincludes one of the few comedic scenes in the show.  As partially shownin the film's trailers, when Doug tries to look up her dress in thelibrary, she has both an enticement and a surprise for him.  Connellysteals her scenes in INVENTING THE ABBOTTS.       The older sister Alice has a child and is about to be divorced.Alice is trivially older than the others, but the extra two years meansshe is the only one that can buy the beer.  Alice's role is small, andGoing's acting diminishes rather than enhances its importance.       The story focuses more on Pam than on the other sisters.  Pamlooks and walks an ostrich.  The costumes by Aggie Guerard Rodgers andthe makeup, transform a normally radiant Tyler into a gawky teenager --the mirror image of her looks in STEALING BEAUTY.  Unlike her sexuallyactive sisters, Pam wants to take it slow, real slow, when it comes tosex.  She draws the line at kissing, which drives Doug's raginghormones wild.  Tyler's acting is convincing during this part, but notlater when Pam has supposedly matured some.       The Abbott family, like the Larrabee family in SABRINA, usesparties as a form of control.  They throw them constantly as largess tobuy off the town.  The Abbotts are run with an iron glove by the fatherLloyd (Will Patton).  Patton (THE SPITFIRE GRILL) outlines his part butlittle more, happy to keep it pure formula.  Lloyd's wife Joan (BarbaraWilliams) shows up but has nothing to do.       Screenwriter Ken Hixon creates a movie full of poignant andrealistic vignettes.  Typical of these is the simple scene of Doug andPam horsing around on the family sofa.  He wants to go upstairs andhave sex with her, but she resists.  They end up having non-sexual fun,just kidding around with each other.  Their play comes to a halt whenher big feet hit him in the groin.       The film's major difficulties stem from Pat O'Connor's direction.O'Conner, who gave us the delightful CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, seems incapableof weaving Hixon's vignettes into a compelling whole.  The film dragsfrequently and the actors are allowed to let their voices taper offinto incomprehensible, low mumbles.  The film's pacing and energy leveltoo often sag.  The good parts are so insightful and strong that theyeasily carry the picture, but the interludes can be quite frustrating. ",Inventing the Abbotts,R,1997,2
477,"Perhaps love can conquer everything - but not Alzheimer's. Based onJohn Bayley's two memoirs about his wife, British novelist/philosopher IrisMurdoch, this is the heart-wrenching story of a loving couple's valiant battlewith that degenerative disease. What elevates the tragic concept are fouramazing performances: Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville as the young pair andJudi Dench and Jim Broadbent as their aging counterparts. Spanning 43 years, thescreenplay by director Richard Eyre and Charles Wood intercuts flashbacks of thecourtship of a high-spirited, lusty, bohemian novelist by a staid, stammeringUniversity lecturer with their later married life as a renowned author andliterary critic in an unkempt Oxfordshire manor house. Problem is: while wewitness their amicable interaction, we know little about them as individuals -except her credo: ""Only one freedom is worthwhile, that of the mind."" Murdoch'smanipulative promiscuity is mentioned, but there's no hint of her passion forPlato's philosophy nor her intolerance of children. And Bayley's merely adevoted, socially inept cipher. It's frustrating to have the characters remainso remote. But that's in the writing, not the performances. Judi Dench isphenomenal, particularly when she realizes that something is dreadfully wrong asshe tries to spell the word ""puzzled"" - and it's not just forgetfulness. JimBroadbent matches her every step of the way on her debilitating descent intoconfusion and darkness. As their energetically youthful peers, Kate Winslet andHugh Bonneville mesh seamlessly. The physical resemblances are uncanny - as isMartin Walsh's astonishing editing. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,""Iris"" is an intelligent, insightful, unconventional 9.

His name isAngel (Isaac Hayes), and he tells us in the beginning that the movie""is mostly true."" Although it is true, it is told as a fairy tale and,moreover, a wonderful romance.       The basic plot setup is that a cop (Nicolas Cage), gives awaitress (Bridget Fonda) a tip of half of his lottery ticket.  Theticket turns out to be worth $4,000,000.  The waitress is the classicbad luck type who has just that day declared bankruptcy.       The cop has had a long childless marriage to his childhoodgirlfriend (Rosie Perez).  Their marriage is one where he muses that""I'm not sure why we ever got married, but we no longer have anythingto say to each other."" Perez is not happy with him either because he isnot making ""any serious money"".  Her girlfriend advises her to dump himand marry an electrician.

479,"Directed by Fred Schepisi (2001's ""Last Orders""), ""It Runs in theFamily"" is a conceited, self-involved comedy-drama that is a literalfamily affair--Michael Douglas (2001's ""Don't Say a Word""), fatherKirk Douglas (1999's ""Diamonds""), mother Diana Douglas, and son CameronDouglas are all on hand. There are so many Douglas' running around,in fact, that onscreen-only family members Rory Culkin (2002's ""Signs"")and Bernadette Peters nearly seem like impostors in the grand schemeof things. While it is nice to see Kirk and Michael playing fatherand son, they should have kept looking for the right project. The Grombergs are your typical dysfunctional, wisecracking Jewishfamily. Alex (Michael Douglas), who works at a soup kitchen in hisspare time, considers an affair with a younger coworker (Sarita Choudhury),despite having been married to Rebecca (Bernadette Peters) for 22years. Fifth-year college son Asher (Cameron Douglas) isn't as interestedin education as he is in dealing drugs and winning the heart of afellow student (Michelle Monaghan). His 11-year-old brother, Eli (RoryCulkin), is just discovering the opposite sex, and gets a crush ona wild, former runaway schoolmate (Irene Gorovaia). Meanwhile, parentsMitchell (Kirk Douglas) and Evelyn (Diana Douglas) are dealing withthe effects of getting old--he's recovering from a stroke and she'sbeing treated for dialysis. ""It Runs in the Family"" has a handful of understated moments of truth,but most of it is hokey, unoriginal, and amazingly smug. Written byJesse Wigutow (what, couldn't Loretta Douglas, Michael's second-cousin-removed,have written it?), the film is so bankrupt of fresh or enliveningstory ideas that it throws into the pot two major deaths, a maritaldispute, a possible affair, a pair of young romances, and an extremelyunconventional form of cremation. With all of these various threadsswirling about, credit director Fred Shepisi for mostly avoiding amawkish tone. Give him a demerit for sloppily handling the streamof subplots, some of which are never satisfactorily concluded beforethe end credits have arrived. Dare it seem like ""It Runs in the Family"" is a total wipeout, it shouldbe said that there are individual scenes and performances that areeffective. Kirk Douglas, his speech impeded by a real-life 1995 stroke,is equally endearing and poignant as a man whose stubbornness doesn'talways allow him to say the things he feels toward his loved ones.Michael Douglas plays off him well, and there is no denying the easyrapport that obviously comes from them being related. In his first film role, Cameron Douglas handles himself admirably,particularly in the scenes he shares with lovely, under-fed newcomerMichelle Monaghan (2002's ""Unfaithful""). And Rory Culkin, so excellentas Mel Gibson's son in ""Signs,"" continues to strengthen his actingr‰sum‰ with wise-beyond-his-years turns. A scene in which Culkin bondswith his burgeoning girlfriend after they skip out on a middle schooldance is beautifully handled in its unforced subtlety. Only BernadettePeters appears to be out of her element, bogged down by overplayed histrionics. There is an audience that may genuinely enjoy ""It Runs in the Family,""but they are likely to either be Michael or Kirk fans, and/or overthe age of 65. Savvier viewers will be able to see right through thisthoroughly mediocre film's charade. There is nothing outright terribleabout the finished product, but in its stringently commonplace existenceare 109 minutes that unveil just how unnecessary and too cute by ahalf this particular family outing is.",It Runs In The Family,PG-13,2003,2
480," If anything, Oliver Stone's 1991 pseudo propaganda film 'JFK' certainlyinfuriated many who believed that Stone had no right to mix togetherfilm clips of authenticity with his own injection of the truth.Outraged media jackals still draw references to Stone and this film whenmaking a point, mostly to complain about the inaccuracies of a certainscenario.  It just so happens that I admire Stone for his complex andPROVEN statement that a conspiracy took place in the murder of John F.Kennedy.  Because of the shocking nature of the assassination, a quick rush tojudgment, called the Warren Commission, tried to calm America's fears ofa government over throw and blamed everything on a half baked ex-Marineusing a rifle with a faulty scope.  Like most important fragments ofhistorical documentation, they sometimes aren't recognized for what theyare at the time of their occurrence until years later when the whole mixhas time to settle and the public ranks it in order of importance.  Mostsurveyed at the time 'JFK' came out, believed that the WarrenCommission's findings were severely flawed.  A much different opinion incontrast to the first release of the report in 1964.  I'm not about to go over the entire process of re-creating theassassination scenario but over 80% of people surveyed believe there wasa conspiracy.  Where Stone makes a mistake in his film is in theoutright declaration of multiple government forces strung together tokill the president.  Certainly, it is a good theory that some body ofgovernment probably had a hand at bringing down Kennedy's presidency butStone should have pin pointed one theory instead of speculating on manydifferent organizations.  Television's 'The X-Files makes assumptionsthat a government conspiracy is on its way to changing the outright lifestyle of America's (and perhaps the world's) civilization, but the show only portrays dark figures in the commission of these crimes and points the finger directly at no one.  A smart style of presentation.  In fairness, Stone does point out that Kennedy was killed because hewould have withdrawn troops from Vietnam and eventually the profitable war machine would have slowed down and the war never would have takenplace.  A good theory but as debatable as any other to come along.  The film opens with a startling mix of edited clips from documented history which have a narrative added to them and the moments leading up to the assassination are pin pointed.  Word of this reaches New Orleansdistrict attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) who witnesses thebreaking news of it all on television along with a colleague and the weekend that follows is as crazy to everyone in the D.A.'s office as the entire staff witnesses on television the murder of JFK's accusedassassin, Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman).  Things settle down but Garrison is strangely drawn back into the investigation of thepresidents death three years later, in 1966.  Throughout the course of the investigation which wraps up after a trial in 1969, when Garrison unsuccessfully prosecuted an internationallyknown businessman named Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), 'JFK' movies like a high tech thriller which combines the most gripping photography and impressive editing ever seen in motion pictures.  Both the editing and camera work were awarded well deserved Oscars.    Oliver Stone's ""in your face"" style of film presentation is done withthe most multi-media like tools.  Using echoed and sharp sound effects,black and white photography, slow motion and many other mixes of filmenhancement, Stone certainly holds nothing back and those who criticized the film as fiction only did more to enhance the film's appeal in making people want to see it.  'JFK' answers no serious questions for most who were around at the timeof the assassination, but the film raises some very interesting pointsand although Oliver Stone's career has been sagging somewhat since itcame out, at least Stone's protest against the alleged cover-up thattook place in 1963 is a testament to one man's courage using the world's most emotional medium. ",JFK,R,1991,2.5
481,"John Wilkes Booth, Sirhan Sirhan, Gavrilo Princip, JamesEarl Ray, Lee Harvey Oswald--all succeeded in assassinatingtheir political targets.  But all were caught and punished.  Inthe movie, ""The Jackal,"" IRA terrorist Declan Mulqueen(Richard Gere),  responsible for the death of several Britishsubjects, was likewise caught and imprisoned.  Only theJackal (Bruce Willis) has succeeded in removing his marksfrom the scene and getting away with it, the only thing heldbehind bars being the millions upon millions of dollars he hasaccumulated from the wealthy men who have given himassignments.  Though he could have retired to the tenniscourts and golf courses long ago, he is a professional killerwho gains great delight in doing his job.  When he is given$35 million in advance of a killing with the promise of another$35 mil after the deed is done, he could easily have taken themoney and run.  But the Jackal, like the animal for whom heis named, derives as much pleasure from the hunt as fromthe kill.      Based loosely on Fred Zinnemann's 1973 British-Frenchthriller ""The Day of the Jackal""--about the intricate plan toassassinate French leader Charles De Gaulle on the ChampsElysees--Michael Caton-Jones's film plays by the numbers. Annoyingly enough, it recycles the age-old flaw of so manymurder plots: when the villain gets the drop on the pursuers,he could easily go away the winner, but takes so much timemeditating on the imminent murder he is himself deleted. Despite its formulaic format and absence of witty dialogue""The Jackal"" has some things going for it, notably the weaponwhich the title character uses to execute his target and thedisguises he assumes to get into the United States and workhis way to the victim's zone.     The story opens in Moscow where a group of Russianmilitia together with agents from the American FBI raid a nightclub and kill a Mafia chieftain who, in a most uncool mannercurses out the officials before his public.  Determined to getrevenge on the United States for its part in the slaying of thisgangster, his brother hires the Jackal (Bruce Willis) to takeout a prominent target in the U.S.--$35 million before, anequal amount after the execution.  Director Michael Caton-Jones has quite a bit of fun dressing Willis up in anassortment of wigs and mustaches, all designed to ease hisway into the U.S. and manipulate his victims.  In some scenesWillis is unrecognizable with thick mustache, five-day growthof beard and long hair, in others he is his usual handsomeself though he switches from gray hair to light brown to darkcoloring.  Caton-Jones has much less fun with the good guy,Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere), an IRA terrorist being heldin a maximum security prison, who is offered the chance foreither a pardon or a transfer to a country-club jail if he willassist the FBI in tracking down the Jackal.  Gere goesthrough the motions mechanically, holding on to his Irishbrogue throughout the movie, but otherwise coming across asa colorless individual who never shows the passion he shouldabout gaining revenge on the criminal who at one time shothis girl friend, killing her fetus.     ""The Jackal"" from time to time draws on the 007 genre,apparently filmed in Moscow, London, Montreal, andWashington, highlighting the killer's intricate strategy insneaking into the U.S.--by flying to Montreal with a falseCanadian passport, buying an expensive boat, and sailing aspart of the Mackinaw-Chicago race.  Equally amusing is hispurchase of a super gun which can shoot several rounds persecond and discharge minor missiles as well.  At one point hecoats the back of his van with a deadly poison, which, whentouched by one of his enemies, causes the man's gruesomeand violent death.     Diane Venora plays the most captivating character, arough-tough Moscow agent with pronounced facial scars who,if not mercifully shot in this movie would surely have beendone in by lung cancer.  When she is not huffing and puffingon a cigarette she is busy lighting another.  You wonder howmuch the tobacco industry contributed to the making of thismovie: why else provide the mostly young audience with sucha chain-smoking role model?     For all we know, weapons such as the one used by theJackal exist today, but they are most likely in the hands of thegovernments of the great powers than in those of anindividual.  Willis gets to send out a great deal of firepower bysimply tapping a few keys on his laptop, giving new meaningto those ads in Tuesday's New York Times for ever-more-powerful computers. ","Jackal, The",R,1997,3.5
482,"At the beginning and end of ""Jackass: The Movie,"" based on the now-canceledMTV reality series, there is a warning to audiences that the stuntsthey are about to see or have just seen should not be tried at home.If I had been the producer, I would have added a follow-up warning:""Prepare to watch the first film in history with the visceral powerto inflict actual physical pain on audience members."" In a way, theformer, used warning is necessary, yet silly, because anyone who wouldwillingly attempt the stunts in the film deserve to be sent to a hospitalfor psychiatric observation. Directed by Jeff Tremaine, ""Jackass: The Movie"" makes a serious casefor why a film critic's job is sometimes a tricky one. For one, thepicture really is simply three uncensored episodes strung together,with no story to speak of and some of the most execrable footage sureto ever be found in an R-rated studio production. And two, there isoccasional amusement to be found, mostly due to how far the cast willgo in their pursuit of claiming victory over the title, but not asmany overall laughs as they are likely hoping for. The movie isn'tuproariously funny so much as it is an inconsequential curiosity ofdegradation and pure disgust. Too often, the viewer isn't reactingto humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance. For those unfamiliar with the controversial television show, ""Jackass""is a series of unconnected skits in which the crazy-assed cast members(headed by Johnny Knoxville) perform a variety of painful stunts andplay gags on unsuspecting innocents. That's it; things don't get much deeper than that. ""Jackass: The Movie"" is akin to a bloody roadside auto accident thatyou want to turn away from, but can't. Some of the material is soout-there and so graphic that it once again puts into question thevalidity of those fools at the MPAA ratings board. While Rob Zombie'smuch-delayed, fictional ""House of 1000 Corpses""--which probably onlyhas some fake blood and violence--had to be severely cut to garneran R, ""Jackass"" is a reality film that has been unleashed seeminglywithout problem from the ratings board. Want to graphically see aman urinate on his snow-cone, eat it, and then throw it up? Want tosee someone stuff a toy car up his rectum? How about a man defecatingin his underwear and then attempting to clean himself up, the sightof which causes the cameraman to barf all over the street? It canbe assured that the sight of the cast getting intentional papercutsbetween their fingers and toes, and on their tongues and eyelids,is the most squirm-inducing moment in any! movie this year. ""Jackass: The Movie"" is an amalgamation of three kinds of scenes:the genuinely funny, the sick and twisted, and the lame. Not coincidentally,the sequences that did garner laughs were those that could have easilybeen shown on television, such as a series of gags where the castpose as old men on the streets of Japan, or a trip to a golf coursewhere they hide in the bushes and continuously blow a horn every timeone of the players swings their club. When the perverse, stomach-churningmaterial was stripped away, you could concentrate on the sillinessof the situations, rather than their sickness. Also making an unwelcomeappearance are skits that are absolute failures, such as a trick charismaticperformer Johnny Knoxville (2002's ""Big Trouble"") plays on a car rental dealership. There will be those (mostly die-hard fans of the show) who will watch""Jackass: The Movie"" from beginning to end and laugh almost non-stop.That is all well and good, and to be expected. The problem is thatTom Green had an almost identical series on Comedy Central aroundthe same time period as ""Jackass,"" but was immeasurably funnier andmore witty. When Green played cruel tricks on his parents, their reactionsseemed authentic, and all the more hilarious because of it. Throughoutthis film, Bam Margera does the same thing to his parents, but theirreactions seem pre-planned and poorly acted. Whereas Tom Green revealedhimself to be some sort of crazed genius, the cast of ""Jackass"" arejust idiots. Go see ""Jackass: The Movie"" and you will not be ableto turn away. Once it is over, mourn for what today's general publichas resorted to calling entertainment. If these 80 minutes don't signalthe coming of the apocalypse, nothing ever will.",Jackass: The Movie,R,2002,1
483," The ""Fab 4"" of Ronald Reagan High are four stuck-up girls, played by Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz and Charlotte Roldan, who overdress like 4 Posh Spice wannabes.  Their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty, and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make-up and powder their cheeks.  Under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public.  In writer and director Darren Stein's JAWBREAKER, it isn't as funny as it sounds.  In fact, it isn't funny at all.  Stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like HEATHERS and stripped it of any intelligence, wit or charm.  His actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don't have time to add any emotion.  And all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains.  The setup for the movie has one of the Fab 4, Liz, who is referred to as ""the Princess Di of Reagan High,"" be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong.  The Princess Di reference is in bad taste, as is much of the movie.  Granted, bad taste can sometimes be funny, but the mere presence of bad taste doesn't guarantee it.  Liz's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth, tape her mouth shut, and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car.  When they open the trunk later, Liz is dead.  They eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like Liz was the victim of a brutal rape.  These realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead, seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer.  The film's dialog not only isn't funny, it's trite.  One nerdy young girl introduces herself with ""My name is Fern Mayo, as in hold the mayo.""  When Fern discovers what has happened, the Fab 3 make her an offer she can't refuse -- make-up! They cake it on her and welcome her to the clan.     The parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching Oprah.  The teachers fare no better, especially in the ridiculous lines they are given.  ""Miss Shayne, please cover your bosom,"" one young teacher, who has been made up to look old and ugly, says without any conviction.  ""This is a learning institution, not a brothel.""  Besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made, there is one other question that I'd like to ask the director.  Why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway?  In a cameo, Pam Grier plays Detective Vera Cruz, who investigates Liz's murder.  As she interrogates the other people, she stares at them like they are all idiots, proving that she is the only one that gets it.  I am sure that if the hard nosed Detective Cruz were to see this movie, she'd walk out after about 5 minutes, and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it.  JAWBREAKER runs 1:27. It is rated R for violence, gore, profanity and sex. I would advise everyone to avoid it, but if teenagers go they should be older and mature. ",Jawbreaker,R,1999,2
484," JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK, Kevin Smith's swan song to his two most famouscharacters, is the best received comedy that I've seen since THERE'S SOMETHINGABOUT MARY, which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in JAYAND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK.  The audience didn't just laugh; they went wild withboisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout.  In short, if you like reallyraunchy humor, you may find it, as I did, to be the funniest movie of the year. (On the other hand, if you are one of those who walked out in disgust withSmith's DOGMA, then JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK is not the movie for you.)  In one of the fastest paced movies of the year, the story has Jay and Silent Bob(Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), a pair of card carrying drug dealers, travelingfrom their New Jersey convenience store home to Hollywood so that they can stopa movie.  It seems their comic book alter egos, Bluntman and Chronic, are beingused in a movie without Jay and Silent Bob's consent.  Jason Biggs and James VanDer Beek are slated to star in it.  JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK has more andbetter used cameos than just about any movie that I've ever seen.  Among others,they include Carrie Fisher as a bible-toting nun, Mark Hamill as a comic bookversion of his famous alter ego and Gus Van Sant as a director too busy countinghis money to yell, ""Action!""  Best of all are Ben Affleck and Matt Damon whomock themselves and their movies.    The film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was""stupid"" enough to buy tickets to this movie.  (Actually, purchasing tickets tothis film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollarthan anything in recent memory.)  The film even skewers people who write aboutmovies on the Internet.  Guilty.  Although it's filled with inside jokes, you'll still be laughing even if youonly get some of them.  It's easy to understand enough so that they are stillfunny.    Jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize.  Hisfavorite topic is oral sex, but, being an equal opportunity profaner, he'swilling to make crude jokes about absolutely anything.  But it is his buddy, theaptly named Silent Bob, who is responsible for most of the movie's success.  Hisreaction shots, with his wildly exaggerated eye movements, are comedic gems.  The story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists, Justice (ShannonElizabeth) and her three sexy buddies, Sissy (Eliza Dushku), Missy (JenniferSchwalbach Smith) and Chrissy (Ali Larter).  These Charlie's Angels types give aride to our heroes on their trek to LaLaLand to stop the picture.  Jay tries toput the moves on Justice, but he doesn't stay in command of the situation forlong.  One of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink, clam-shaped,birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry.  Granted, it's not the movie for everyone, but, if you like Kevin Smith's brandof humor, you'll find that this is his best.  And, as I said earlier, it's thefunniest movie of the year thus far.  No, wait.  Forget, `thus far.'  It's boundto be the funniest movie of the year.  In a time when almost every movie feelsobligated to come in at PG-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash, it'sgreat to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience.   JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK runs a lightening fast 1:35.  It is rated R andcontains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations. It would beacceptable for high school seniors and older. ",Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,R,2001,3.5
485,"His first motion picture set outside of the View Askew universe, writer-directorKevin Smith (2001's ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"") has sa id thathe conceived of the kinder and gentler ""Jersey Girl"" based on hisresponse to becoming a father. His fatal error, however, is that hehas mistaken maturity for old Hollywood cliches and conventions. Thereare a few honest moments to be found in ""Jersey Girl,"" but its triteplot devices ring with a resounding falseness. And instead of givinghis underwritten characters room to live and breathe as fresh individuals,Smith has put them at the strict mercy of his screenplay. ""JerseyGirl"" may be Kevin Smith's most technically polished films to date(and with a cinematographer like the renowned Vilmos Zsigmond at thehelm, there is good reason for this), but it is also one of his weakest.  Ollie Trinke (Ben Affleck) is a workaholic Manhattan publicist witha beloved newlywed wife, Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez), and a baby onthe way. His dreams for the future are shattered, however, when Gertrudeunexpectedly dies during childbirth, leaving Ollie with a daughterto raise on his own. Under the stress of caring for child Gertie,he makes a fatal error at a Hard Rock Cafe press junket by insultingthe guests and star Will Smith and is promptly fired. Moving backin with his father, Bart (George Carlin), in New Jersey, Ollie vowsto be the best father to Gertie that he possibly can.  Switch forward seven years, Ollie now works with his father for thesanitation department, and Gertie (Raquel Castro) has grown into aheadstrong, precocious first grader. Ollie, who deals with his celibacyby frequently renting porn, has a chance meeting with video storeclerk Maya (Liv Tyler). She is a graduate student who wants to useOllie as one of her subjects on a study concerning masturbation, butin the process grows to sympathize with his sole devotion to Gertie.Maya might be just the right girl for him, but first Ollie has tocome to terms with the life-altering consequences his wife's death has brought him.  With a less intrusive, more naturalistic to ne, ""Jersey Girl"" couldhave been a deft, character-driven slice-of-life, something alongthe lines of writer-director Kevin Smith's best feature, 1997's ""ChasingAmy."" Instead, he time and time again uses the oldest and most tiredof cliches to tell his story„shameless things he seemed to be againstprior to this film. Watch Ollie catch his daughter and a neighborhoodboy playing a game of ""You Show Me Yours, I'll Show You Mine,"" andthen sit them down for a serious interrogation. Watch as Gertie latercatches Ollie and Maya hiding half-nude in the shower, only to sitthem down for the same talk she heard her father give her. Har-har-har.Most disheartening of all is a climax that not only fits in a schoolplay, but follows it up with the ""Slow Clap,"" that annoying moviecliche where one audience member starts to clap slowly until the wholeauditorium has erupted in cheerful applause. Give me a break.  It is a shame, too, because there are individual scenes in ""Jersey Girl"" that are incendiary in their beautiful simplicity. Unfortunately,most of them succeed based on a great visual composition, the useof an overscoring song cue, or through the emotion of a performance.Very few of them, save for a poignant early set-piece in which Olliepresents a tearful monologue to infant Gertie, actually rely on caringabout the people or the plight they are involved in. Ultimately, mostof the characters' actions are frustratingly implausible, such asthe way Maya brazenly offers herself to Ollie by saying, ""We're gonnaget you some sex,"" without any attempt on Smith's part to developher beyond the requirements of the script.  Ben Affleck is a ""Movie Star"" whose depth in creating an effectiveperformance is too often overlooked. I defy anyone to watch ""ChasingAmy,"" 2000's ""Bounce,"" or 2002's ""Changing Lanes"" and honestly saythat he is a bad actor. As the grieving Ollie Trinke, Affleck is onceagain very good, infusing his role with the believability of a manunable to move on in his life, but connected to his daughter by agenuine love and care. Underused as she is, Liv Tyler (2003's ""TheLord of the Rings: The Return of the King"") gets in several touchingmoments, even if her relationship with Ollie lacks the screen timerequired to give it the gravitas yearned for. As young Gertie, newcomerRaquel Castro is convincing without being cloying. Surprisingly, thetwo standout performances are given by usual leading man actors inminor roles. As Ollie's devoted assistant, Jason Biggs hasn't beenthis engaging since 2001's ""American Pie 2."" And playing himself inan important late scene, Will Smith (2003's "" Bad Boys II"") is exceptional.His talent long buried in one special effects extravaganza after thenext, Smith lends his single scene with an effortless magnetism andastuteness he hasn't shown since 1993's ""Six Degrees of Separation."" He's that good.  There is one big laugh in ""Jersey Girl,"" the culmination of a gruesome""Sweeney Todd"" musical number the cast performs before an unsuspectingaudience of elementary school parents. This wicked gag hints at what""Jersey Girl"" might have been, had Kevin Smith stuck to his guns andnot lost the edge needed for this bittersweet story to ring true.Instead, the film is too cute by a half, downright corny in spotsand merely unbelievable in others. Save for those seldom truthfulinterludes that sneak in every once in a while, there is little evidencethat Kevin Smith is actually a father at all. This, indeed, is hiscalamitous pitfall. ""Jersey Girl"" is marginally likable, but it isa misfire in Smith's career, nonetheless. And although the two havelittle in common, 2003's vastly underrated ""Gigli"" was the betterfilm. How's that for irony?",Jersey Girl,PG-13,2004,2.5

Directed by television alum Dennie Gordon (in his feature film debut) and executive-produced by Adam Sandler, it is another halfhearted attempt to inundate audiences with bathroom humor and dog-humping jokes. The only problem is, these jokes are, by now, getting moldier than three-month-old bread, and it has a watered-down PG-13 rating. Every physical joke and every line of dialogue that is supposed to be humorous are both predictable and boring. I didn't laugh, or lightly chuckle, or even smile, once throughout the duration of ""Joe Dirt,"" and it takes a really, really bad comedy to achieve such a dubious feat.  Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a radio station janitor in Los Angeles with a cheesy mullet hairdo straight out of the '70s. Living in the building's boiler room, lightning strikes one day when he finds himself on the air with ""tell-it-like-it-is"" radio personality Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), unspinning his fascinating life story, from the moment when he was abandoned by his trailer trash parents at the Grand Canyon when he was eight, up until the present day, circa twenty years later. Passed along from one wacky foster family to the next as a child, Joe has spent his adult years desperately searching for the whereabouts of his parents, who have seemingly vanished into thin air. Amidst it all, he lost touch with the one person who ever really cared about him, Brandy (Brittany Daniel), a fetching young woman who is about to marry the oily Robby (Kid Rock) by default.  An uninspired road-movie-cum-love-story, ""Joe Dirt"" leaps from one comic setup to the next, without any actual care for the story at hand, or the fact that the comedy is D.O.A. David Spade (1999's ""Lost & Found""), who also acts as co-writer to the episodic screenplay, can be a charming performer, but he tries too hard here to be like fellow comedians Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider. In the process, he flounders in a story that would be above the most listless actor in Hollywood.  Cameos are prevalent, perhaps to make up for the lacking material, as they include everyone from Christopher Walken (what is he doing her?), to rapper Kid Rock, to Rosanna Arquette. The only person who permeates any sort of cinematic screen presence is Brittany Daniel (a former recurring actor on TV's ""Dawson's Creek""), as the sweet Brandy, who makes for an attractive love interest. Daniel's scenes, and one admittedly clever vignette in which Joe is captured and put into a well by a cross-dressing serial killer with a white-haired poodle, a 'la ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" are the only elements that raise ""Joe Dirt"" above being utterly worthless. The classic rock soundtrack, including Blue Oyster Cult's ""Burnin' for You"" and Bachman Turner-Overdrive's ""You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet,"" isn't bad, either.  There are so many things wrong with ""Joe Dirt,"" however, that these passing bright spots are only cause for cursory interest. The whole of the film is birdbrained and silly, and doesn't work for a second. Likewise, director Dennie Gordon shows no flair for filmmaking, unable to set up even the most simple jokes for an acceptable payoff.

487,"What gives this otherwise featherweight picture some heft is itstheme, one with which most people in the audience are likely toidentify.  We all want to be noticed, to be somebody, to fit in withthe crowd and yet to stand out in some way.  We conform to agreat extent to our peer culture: pierce our tongues if that's whatthe gang's doing, wear jeans with cut-outs in the knees.  Butwhat to do to be the center of attention?  We can be the class clown,the chess maven, the captain of the basketball team rather thanjust a player.  Joe Scheffer (Tim Allen), for example, fits in justfine in his office as a video specialist in a Twin Citiespharmaceutical company but after ten years he has not receivedthe promotion he deserves based not only on seniority but on hisparticular talent for making marketing videos for the drugs hiscompany is pushing.     ""Joe Somebody"" has all the markings of sitcom, in fact many ofthe performers made their names from TV aside from Tim Allen(""Home Improvement"").  The woman of his dreams, Meg (JulieBowen) comes from the TV comedy series ""Ed,"" his nemesis,Jeremy (Greg Germann) from ""Ally McBeal,"" screenwriter JohnScott Shepherd's 12-year-old daughter Hayden Panettiere, in therole of Joe's daughter Natalie, has appeared on soaps and JimBelushi in the role of martial arts expert Chuck is from ""Accordingto Jim.""     The movie would probably tank if it were not for Tim Allen, a48-year-old actor whose romance with a woman who looks about28 is unlikely in the real world but de rigueur in the movies.

Because his daughter and several co- workerswitness the attack, Joe is particularly humiliated anddetermined to have a rematch in three weeks--when thesuspended McKinney returns to work.  He works out in the gym,plays squash with his buddy, and in the movie's best comicscenes trains with martial artist Chuck Scarett (Jim Belushi),expecting to be in shape in just three weeks.  As the peoplearound him see a man with new vigor and spark--not the leastbeing his ex-wife Callie (Kelly Lynch) and the pixie-ish MegHarper (Julie Bowen)--Joe becomes a somebody.  Everyonelooks forward to the big fight: everyone, that is, except the mostimportant people in his life, namely his daughter and his officesweetie.     At times director John Pasquin pushes the humor as when herepeats a commercial for a prescription drug in which theannouncer relates the side effects: headache, nausea,depression, stomach ailments, depression and in some casesdeath.  At other times Pasquin relies on cutesy scenes betweenJoe and the daughter who seems to be taking over in her homeas her confused and lonely mother begins to regret dumping Joeand uses the 12-year-old for support.  But the scenes betweenJoe and Chuck are the showstoppers as two people fromdifferent walks of life learn to like each other while practicing inthe ring (though what is called martial arts looks more likeconventional boxing lessons).

Apparently, nothing.Unimaginatively directed by Peter Howitt (2001's ""Antitrust""), ""JohnnyEnglish"" casts British comedian Rowan Atkinson (TV's ""Bean"" and 2002's""Scooby-Doo"") in the bumbling title role and expects him to do allthe work. While Atkinson is at his offbeat best, the film he has beenplaced within is sorely routine and more often blase than not, itsevery joke telegraphed far in advance of its ultimate appearance. When the rest of England's spies are killed in an explosion, the fullresponsibility of the job is placed on the shoulders of Johnny English(Rowan Atkinson), an accident-prone doofus who daydreams of beinga sexy, debonair hero, like James Bond. His latest mission is to protectthe Crown Jewels, which are subsequently stolen by wealthy FrenchmanPascal Sauvage (John Malkovich). Sauvage, who had his royal lineagestolen from him years ago, intends to take over the whole of Englandand turn it into a maximum security prison. Helping the inept JohnnyEnglish on his quest to expose Sauvage's criminal intent is trustyassistant Bough (Ben Miller) and sexy secret agent Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia). There are two spectacularly funny scenes in ""Johnny English."" Thefirst concerns Johnny confusing a real-life, tear-filled funeral internmentand a staged one, with zany results. The other depicts Johnny mistakinga medical center and its well-meaning doctors, nurses, and patientsfor Sauvage's lair and its respective henchmen and hostages. RowanAtkinson, wonderful in the kind of classic misfit role he usuallyplays, carries out these comic highlights with a deadpan sinceritythat becomes all the more uproarious when he continues to dig himselfa deeper hole in the face of each misstep. And the scenes are alsonotable for their freshness and their wit, two elements otherwiselacking in this decidedly lazy effort. Written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and William Davies (the formertwo of which worked on 2002's ""Die Another Day""), the film fails tomake the comedic cut. Most of the humor is not only clumsily predictable,but enormously juvenile, with unfunny jokes concerning fecal matterbeing flushed in Johnny's face and the Archbishop of Canterbury gettinghis underwear pulled down for a roomful of royal onlookers in an identitymix-up. Each scene is like its own little private skit, as Johnnyattempts to do the right thing, screws it up, and then must make amendsfor his careless behavior. It gets old fast, not the least becauseit is so obvious and unchallenging in its comic possibilities.  As Johnny's loyal assistant, Bough (pronounced ""Boff""), Ben Miller(2002's ""Birthday Girl"") splendidly slides into the part of sidekick,while John Malkovich (1999's ""Being John Malkovich"") puts on a sillyFrench accent and hams it up as main villain Pascal Sauvage. In heracting debut, singer Natalie Imbruglia doesn't attract any negativeattention as the beautiful Lorna Campbell, but also has little ofnote to do. At least she seems natural in front of the camera, avoidingthe stilted mannerisms and unconvincing dialogue readings of somemusicians-turned-actors (Madonna, anyone?). The ""Austin Powers"" films had their fair share of flaws, to be sure,but they were enlightened with some truly original, ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink""setpieces. ""Johnny English"" pales in comparison, abounding with limperjokes and less energy, and that's even while taking into account thewelcome prowess of star Rowan Atkinson, who gives Mike Myers a runfor his money as #1 spy spoof hero. Unfortunately, in the case of""Johnny English,"" #1 simply isn't good enough when everything surroundingits star is instantly forgettable fodder. Special Note: Further proof that the MPAA has no rhyme, reason, orconsistence behind its ratings, last year's ""Mr. Deeds"" was ratedPG-13 for ""rear nudity"" (which lasted for all of about 10 seconds),while ""Johnny English"" is rated PG for ""comic nudity"" (consistingof a close-up shot of rear nudity that lasts approximately 30 seconds,and closely followed by a scene in which Atkinson gyrates his tighty-whitey-cladpelvis in a sexual manner). I do not complain about the PG-rating""Johnny English"" has been given because it deserves a PG-13, evenif it might have been more appropriate; instead, I only bring it upas further proof why the old farts at the MPAA should hang up theirwitch-hunting profession and pass down the responsibility to someoneyounger and more in tune to today's audiences. It would help evenmore if their ratings were consistent from movie to movie, ratherthan an inexplicable game of ""playing favorites.""",Johnny English,PG,2003,2
490,"In 1980s cyberpunk was definitely the most popular sub-genreof literary science fiction, with plenty of new, young andtalented writers exploring new, dark but fascinating high-tech world of near future. However, for some strange reason,the attempts to recreate this world on the screen (with somenotable exceptions) usually fell flat. Not even WilliamGibson, the father of the sub-genre, could escape this sadfate, as demonstrated in JOHNNY MNEMONIC, 1995 screenadaptation of his best known short story, directed by PeterLongo.  The plot is set in 2021, in a world run by multinationalcorporations, where the information is the most valuablecommodity. Because of the hackers, the most preciousinformation is not transmitted via Internet, but by humancouriers with implanted memory chips in their heads. One ofthose couriers is Johnny (played by Keanu Reeves), whose isgreedy and agrees to double capacity of the chip and riskshaving his own brain melting down. While he carriesinformation from Beijing to Newark, rival corporation hashired yakuzas led by Takahashi (played by Takeshi Kitano) tosteal the information from his head. The only shelter forJohnny is the underworld ruled by LoTeks led by J-Bone(played by Ice-T).  Even those accustomed to the good literature turning intobad films would be unpleasantly surprised by JOHNNYMNEMONIC. Gibson, who wrote and produced the film, wastedalmost entire screen potential of his short story. Newcharacters and subplots were introduced, mostly in order toprovide film with an interesting cast (that includesJapanese cult director Takeshi Kitano, rock star HenryRollins and German actress Barbara Sukowa) and bringecological and ""politically correct"" anti-technologicalangle to the story. But all those efforts failed miserably,not only because those subplots seemed to be artificialdistraction to the story, but also because of the terriblemiscast of wooden Keanu Reeves as protagonist (whose flatperformance is even worse compared to Dolph Lundgren'shilarious portrayal of homicidal preacher) and tragic choiceof director. First-timer Peter Longo, who had worked onvideoclips, proved to be unsuitable for feature film. Actionscenes are unattractive and repetitive, while specialeffects are bad and often turn into boring display of cheappyrotechnics. The whole atmosphere of cyberpunk world ismissing from JOHNNY MNEMONIC, and anachronistic soundtrackby Michael Danna and Brad Fiedel doesn't help either.Because of all that, JOHNNY MNEMONIC is one of the worstcinema failures of 1990s, and the audience really doesn'thave to find out why the fans of the original storynicknamed this project ""Johnny Moronic"". ",Johnny Mnemonic,R,1995,0.5
491,"Without any ""Based on..."" mention in the credits or even a surprisecameo by Chevy Chase, ""Johnson Family Vacation"" is just a chintzy,plagiaristic redux of 1983's classic ""National Lampoon's Vacation.""There is even a m oment, involving the singing of a particular WayneNewton song, that is a blatant steal from 1997's ""Vegas Vacation.""Let's just say that when you find yourself reaching for inspirationfrom the weakest entry in an otherwise successful four-part series,you know you're in real trouble. Appallingly unfunny, to boot, thereisn't an original, witty, or genuine moment to be found in the entire,seemingly never-ending 96 minutes of ""Johnson Family Vacation.""  Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is a mild-mannered Los Angeleanwho sets off on the open road with his family in a newly-rented, pimped-outLincoln Navigator. On their way to Missouri for their extended family'sannual reunion, where the distinguished title of ""Family of the Year""has been just out of reach in years past, Nate also hopes to rebondwith estranged wife Dorothy (Vanessa Williams) and spend quality timewith aspiring rapper son D.J. (Bow Wow), cell phone-obsessed daughterNikki (Solange Knowles), and precoc ious tot Destiny (Gabby Soleil).As with Clark Griswold's misadventures, everything that could go wrongfor Nate and family does. A psychotic trucker tries to run them offthe road. A luxurious dip in the hot tub ends with Nate being bombardedby hefty, buxom strangers. When they make the mistake of picking upsexy hitchhiker Chrishelle (Shannon Elizabeth), they learn too latethat she is a voodoo witch. Their SUV is virtually destroyed by wetcement, and then they run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. UnlikeClark Griswold's misadventures, however, none of it is the least bitfunny or fresh. Furthermore, the Johnson family is an insufferable,one-dimensional lot„a far cry from the likable Griswold clan. The shoddy directing debut of Christopher Erskin, watching ""JohnsonFamily Vacation"" is about as stimulating as an actual 300-mile driveacross the desert wastelands of Arizona and New Mexico. The film'sgoals are simple enough to figure out„it wants to be a light, comicentertainment with slapstick moments culminating in a well-meaning,moralistic ending„but it fails at all of the above. Frothy thoughit may be, the picture is a veritable chore to sit through, its everyworn-out, groan-inducing setpiece taking twice as much time as itneeds to set up a joke that can be seen coming a mile away by anyviewer with half a brain. The horridly banal screenplay (by Todd R. Jones and Earl Richey Jones)is to blame for the film's plodding, lazy nature, but so is the editingby John Carter (2002's ""Barbershop""), who doesn't show any proof thathe can adequately set up a joke through the rhythmic buildup of hisshots. There is a difference between carefully milking a comedic momentfor all it's worth and dragging said sequence out so far beyond thelimits of possible impact that it just tests one's patience and feelsdesperate. Other comedy bits, such as the placement of a payphonein a cornfield and a nonsensical sign the family passes advertisingthe reunion, are so outlandish and nonsensical that they feel likethey should be in a different movie altogether. Because there is onlyone marginally funny scene in the whole film, concerning an unorthodoxdinner prayer given by Chrishelle, the overly deliberate pacing isn'tonly annoying, but close to unbearable. The characters, and the cast who play them, are just as poorly managed.Cedric the Entertainer (2004's ""Barbershop 2: Back in Business"") ismore low-key than usual, but he has little to do but react to thehilarity around him as Nate Johnson. Vanessa Williams (2000's ""Shaft"")makes put-upon, scowling faces as wife Dorothy, all the while rekindlingher love for Nate. This romantic subplot isn't believable for a second.As for teenage son and daughter D.J. and Nikki, Bow Wow (2002's ""LikeMike"") and newcomer Solange Knowles (Beyonce's younger sibling) aresimply terrible, mistaking exaggerated body gestures and line readingsfor a true performance. There is no depth to D.J. and Nikki, nor isthere any palpable connection made between them as brother and sister,or between them and their parents. The hitchhiker subplot had quirkypotential, but Chrishelle, her witchcraft, and the possible circumstancesconcerning spending time with her are never explored. Director ChristopherErskin simply rushes through this segment and abruptly disposes ofChrishelle, who is more interesting than any of the leads, withoutsatisfying closure. Shannon Elizabeth (2001's ""American Pie 2"") isbetter than her thankless role gives her credit for. When the Johnson's finally arrive at their family reunion in Missouri(le t it be known it looks more like the Hollywood Hills than theMidwest), it is understandable for the viewer to expect the storyto wind down. Instead, it continues on for another interminable half-hour,complete with grating arguments between Nate and snotty big brotherMax (Steve Harvey), a potato sack race, and a talent show featuringtwo musical performances. Ultimately, Nate and his family learn athing or two about the importance of being there for each other nomatter what, and they quickly scurry on back home. The epiphany Nateexperiences may mean well, but the way it is presented is egregiousand sickeningly corny. It doesn't help that we have never grown tocare about the Johnson family, either as individuals or as a whole.We're just glad when our time with them has reached an end. Speaking of the end, it doesn't come nearly soon enough in ""JohnsonFamily Vacation,"" a vacuous comedy questionably too racy for youngchildren but not mature enough for anyone over singl e digits . Thisvery conundrum, mixed with blatant copycatting of the superior ""Vacation""movies, amateurish production values, and egotistical preaching, sinksthe film faster than a coin dropped into a water fountain. ""JohnsonFamily Vacation"" is wretched, indeed, notably more loathsome thancould have even been expected.",Johnson Family Vacation,PG-13,2004,1.5
492,"""Josie and the Pussycats,"" writing-directing team Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont's (1998's ""Can't Hardly Wait"") big-screen ode to the '60s Archie comic and the short-lived '70s animated television show, is silly, fun, paper-thin, and cleverly satirical. It's not going to win any major awards (unless its catchy main tune, ""3 Small Words,"" gets a much-deserved Oscar nomination come next year), and it doesn't quite hold up after close scrutiny, but it's entertaining while it lasts, which is probably what the movie's major goal was in the first place.  MegaRecords managing executive Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) and his diabolical boss and CEO of the company, Fiona (Parker Posey), have one goal, and one goal only: to hire a band and wickedly hide subliminal messages and product placements within their songs, brainwashing the youth of America. When DuJour (translation: ""[soup] of the day""), MegaRecords' all-boy band of the moment, threatens to cause the company problems, they are quickly dispatched of. Fiona gives Wyatt just one day to find their ""next big thing,"" which, by chance, comes in the form of three bubbly young women and aspiring musicians living in the peaceful town of Riverdale, who wish for nothing but to hit it big. Before long, Wyatt has signed The Pussycats (now known as ""Josie and the Pussycats"") to a scorching record deal, and in a week, have shot to the #1 spot on the Billboard charts, with millions of obsessive fans around the world clamoring to see them perform in person. Little do starry-eyed Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook), densely sweet Melody (Tara Reid), and serious-minded Valerie (Rosario Dawson) know, their music is being used to send out mixed messages to those listening.  Zippy and cute, ""Josie and the Pussycats"" does nothing but achieve at making a pitch-perfect version of the Archie comic from which it is based on. Everything from the bright color scheme to the fantastically off-beat premise, the film just oozes ""comic."" Luckily, there is a bit more going on underneath than just a direct interpretation of the source material. The cast has a blast with their respective roles, and the music by Josie and the Pussycats (lead vocals by Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo, with backup by the actresses) is unpredictably--almost shockingly--good, so much so that they could truly-to-goodness pass for a talented real-life, all-girl, alt-rock group.  As Josie herself, Rachael Leigh Cook (2001's ""Antitrust"") shows charismatic promise with a front-and-center role that hasn't been equaled since her 1999 hit, ""She's All That."" Tara Reid (2001's ""Just Visiting"") is easily the standout, with her Melody an absolutely endearing character who may be looked upon as a ""ditzy blonde,"" but happily trudges through life always looking on the bright side. Reid springs Melody to life, as her character could actually act as a very positive role model for pre-teens and teenagers everywhere. Rosario Dawson (2000's ""Down to You"") is the weakest link of the three, but only because her character of Val isn't as memorable as the other two are. Dawson remains likable, nonetheless, and a perfectly respectable way to round out the trio of Pussies.  Alan Cumming, more or less replaying his character from the current ""Spy Kids,"" and Parker Posey (2000's ""Scream 3""), ham it up as the scheming villains who are hiding an added secret to themselves. Cumming is good in anything he's in, and Posey gets many laughs from her overtly evil, occasionally lisping, food-obsessed diva. In other supporting roles, Gabriel Mann (2000's ""Cherry Falls""), as Josie's best friend and potential boyfriend, Alan M, is appropriately bland, as is Paulo Costanzo (2000's ""Road Trip""), as the girls' novice agent. Meanwhile, Missi Pyle (1999's ""Trick"") is a comic delight as Costanzo's dedicated sister.  Although it is there to make a point, and does directly correlate with the plot, the over-the-top product placements present in ""Josie and the Pussycats"" do grow monotonous after a while. Not only do they sometimes distract, and detract, from the subject matter of the given scene, but they also feel artificial and antithetical. Sure, the movie deals with product placements being used as subliminal messages, but all of the companies (including McDonalds, Target, Tide, Colgate, MTV, Entertainment Tonight, Evian, Krispy Kreme, among literally hundreds of others) were sure to compensate the producers real well with the added promotion. In this case, less might have been more.  In an age of cynicism, ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is innocent, light-hearted, and charming. Perfect for children, as well as adults, the movie might not be free of flaws (actually, it is far from it, with an opening half-hour that has trouble finding its footing), but it is free of terribly risque or raunchy humor, which works in the film's favor. And Tara Reid's Melody Valentine most definitely gives us an idea of the zestful mindframe of the Pussycats with one of the movie's best lines: ""If I could go back in time,"" she cheerily proclaims, ""I would love to meet Snoopy."" ",Josie and the Pussycats,PG-13,2001,2.5

495,"      If human conditions were patentable, Thomas Hardy would have theoriginal patent for hopelessness.  His characters begin with moments ofutter desperation and then their lives get worse.  Momentary happinessin a Hardy story is only an illusion soon to shattered by someunexpected, but plausibly cataclysmic event.       As Woody Allen said, ""More than any other time in history, mankindfaces a crossroads.  One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness.The other, to total extinction.  Let us pray we have the wisdom tochoose correctly.""  Hardy novels are like that.  Although you don'tread them to have a good time per se, you do gain a greaterunderstanding of life and of your fellow man.       The few Hardy novels made into films for theatrical release, TESS(1979) and FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD (1967), have been excellent, andthis year's JUDE joins that elite list.       Director Michael Winterbottom with the help of screenwriterHossein Amini makes a literal adaptation of Hardy's ""Jude the Obscure.""Yes, the shocking parts are there, but they are not sensationalized,and the film is so realistic that had I not known the story and it waspresented as a true story, I would not have questioned its veracity.       Usually the press kits you get at the screenings are fairlyhonest, but this one did have a whopper of a claim.  As one of myfellow critics pointed out to me, it says that Winterbottom's previousfilm BUTTERFLY KISS was ""a tender and touching love story.""  BUTTERFLYKISS is a story of a vicious serial killer and although I recommendedit, it is anything but tender.  Nevertheless, I am even more impressedby Winterbottom's talents after viewing JUDE.  It is his direction thatmakes the film.  The acting is good, but not on par with the direction.Actually, a cogent argument could be made that the real genius is inthe photography, but more on that latter.       The show opens in the 1860s in a muddy hamlet filmed in black andwhite reflecting its bleakness.  Young Jude Fawley (James Daley) istold by his father that he must go to Christminister if he is to seekhis fortune.  Shown as a Xanadu on a distant hilltop is Christminister.       The show switches to the glorious colors of an English forest andJude (Christopher Eccleston from SHALLOW GRAVE and LET HIM HAVE IT) hasnow grown up.  He meets Arabella (Rachel Griffiths from MURIEL'SWEDDING), and they arrange an assignation.       As all things in poor Jude's life, his affair with Arabella willturn out bad.  No matter how hard he tries he becomes an unsuccessfuloutcast.  He crams Latin and Greek into his brain until his head willsurely burst, but the university rejects him since he is too workingclass for them.  His love life is not much better.  He lives a bitterlife of rejection.       To reinforce the protagonist's despondency, there is a scene wherea pig is killed and his innards removed.  Although it is completelyauthentic, it serves as a metaphor for the desperation Jude feels.  Itmay also give rise to an increase in vegetarianism as it is candid andgory.       One day, into Jude's life walks his beautiful cousin Sue Bridehead(Kate Winslet from SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and HEAVENLY CREATURES), andhe is immediately smitten.  To keep her near him he secures her aposition as an apprentice teacher to Mr. Phillotson (Liam Cunninghamfrom A LITTLE PRINCESS).  With Jude's usual bad luck, Phillotson beginsto fall for his Sue.  His ongoing love for Sue even after she marriesPhillotson gets them both in a lot of trouble, and they becomesociety's outcasts.       The dialog is terrific.  Amini has a deft touch knowing how toadapt the novel for the screen.  ""You are the timid sex,"" Sue tellsJude in an intimate fireplace scene.  She plays him like an old ragdoll telling him that men can do nothing until women give them thatlittle look of acceptance.  Where this scene leads is quiteunpredictable, but not the result - more grief for both of them.       Much later when Jude again comes on to Sue, she spurns hisadvances and then taunts him with, ""promise me you'll never stoptrying.""  Needless to say he views this as extremely cruel.       ""We'll move on again and again as long as it takes for the worldto change.  We've done nothing wrong,"" Jude resolutely tells Sue whentheir fortunes take yet another turn south.  Later Sue asks ""Haven't webeen punished enough?""  In a line that sums up Hardy's view of life,Sue tells Jude, ""It's right that I suffer.""       In scene after scene, the audience has to be in awe of the beautyof the cinematography by Eduardo Serra.  I lost track of the number ofphenomenally gorgeous images.  Among my favorites are the one of thesnow that looks like cumulous clouds that is lit by the early light ofday.  Another has a cottage at dusk with the upper floor encased infog.  All of the interior scenes lit with gaslights have a wonderfulwarmth.  I certainly hope and expect to see an Academy Award nominationfor Serra's work here.       The sets by Joseph Bennett II are a cornucopia of late nineteenthcentury English life.  From the simple pleasures of a faire to basicrustic row houses, it feels totally authentic without ever beingoverdone.       Adrian Johnston's lovely music is full of haunting flutes and ofthe sad strains of a wailing violin.  People should always stay throughthe credits.  In this show you will learn than Mel Gibson had a part.He did the make-up and hair styling.  Perhaps it is not the sameperson.  Then again, ...       For those who do not remember the novel be forewarned that thisbeautiful but consistently morose tale reaches a surprisingly andhorrible conclusion.  It is one that is consistent with the charactersand is genuine, nevertheless, if it doesn't put you in tears, I'd besurprised.       JUDE runs 2:03.  It is rated R.  There is sex, full frontal femalenudity, graphic depiction of birth, death, and animal slaughter, but nobad language.  I am usually conservative when I say which age group ashow is appropriate for, but I am going to go out on a limb on thisone.  I think it would be okay for most teenagers since they wouldlearn from it.  I have a single test for parents.  If you would letyour kids read the book, then this movie should be okay.  Yes, life isfrighteningly depicted, but it is always realistic and neversensationalized.  JUDE gets a strong recommendation from me, and Iaward it *** 1/2. ",Jude,R,1996,3.5
496,"In 1970s skyrocketing crime rates and apparent inability ofliberal state to clamp them down created popular sentimentreflected in the films about Dirty Harry and Paul Kersey.That sentiment also found its way towards comic books, andthat resulted in the futuristic superhero Judge Dredd,featured in the very popular series published in Britishmagazine 2000 AD. After two decades Judge Dredd, like manyother comic book heroes, became adapted to the screen. In1995 that particular task was given to the young Britishdirector Danny Cannon.  The plot is set in the future where the entire planet turnedinto radioactive wasteland. The surviving humans live inoverpopulated megalopolises with skyrocketing crime rates.In order to fight crime, the authorities created Judges -law enforcers authorised to act as judge, jury andexecutioners and thus bring instant justice to any criminalthey apprehend. The best among them is Dredd (played bySylvester Stallone), favourite of the old Judge Fargo(played by Max von Sydow). One day, however, Dredd isaccused of the murder he didn't commit. All the evidencepoint towards him and he is sentenced to prison. While heplots an escape, hoping to clear his name and bring the realperpetrator the justice, Mega-City One becomes the target ofvicious political intrigue.  Fans of the original comic books have all the reasons to bedispleased with this film. Fascist overtones of the originalwere too much for ""politically correct"" 1990s and thecharacter of Dredd in Disney's screen got his violence toneddown and his personality became kinder and gentler, with asense of humour and comic relief in the form of pettycriminal (played by Rob Schneider). The plot of the film is,of course, formulaic and utterly predictable. However,Sylvester Stallone fits this part quite nicely, as well asArmand Assante, who obviously had a lot of fun playing theover-the-top villain. Director Cannon, on the other hand,isn't particularly interested in story and characters -entrusted with huge budget, he probably felt like a kid inthe candy store and that reflected in truly stunning visualsand whole series of spectacular and very attractive actionscenes. But the best thing about Cannon was his sense ofpace - films unfolds very quickly and in 90 minutes we havehardly a time to notice one-dimensionality of thecharacters, predictability of the plot and some obviouslydisinterested actors (like Diane Lane in formulaic role offemale Judge). As a result, JUDGE DREDD is mostlyforgettable, but nevertheless pleasing movie experience. ",Judge Dredd,R,1995,2

Since Jeffrey is a big moviebuff like his Daddy, in the end he decided to go, so the whole familywent on President's Day.  Five minutes into the movie, Jeffrey was inmy lap declaring, ""We should have gone to MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND.""Notwithstanding his periodic fear during the film, we all three lovedit immensely.  It is a great mixture of action, humor, special effects,and poignancy.       As JUMANJI starts, it is a dark, foggy, and spooky night in NewBedford, Massachusetts in the year 1869, and the coyotes are wailingaway.  Two children are burying a box.  A hundred years later, a boynamed Alan Parrish (Adam Hann-Byrd), finds this box and inside is aboard game called Jumanji.  He and his friend Sarah (Laura Bell Bundy)decide to play the game.  When they throw the dice, the pieces move bythemselves so Sarah figures ""it must be magnets"".       Soon the game turns out to be pretty terrifying.  After each turn,ferocious jungle animals come out to attack them.  After one turn, Alangets the message, ""In the jungle you must wait until the dice read fiveor eight.""  He is thereupon sucked into the game, and Sarah runsscreaming out of the room since she is now scared out of her wits.       The story skips ahead to 1995.  The old abandoned Parrish house isbeing occupied by a new set of young children, Peter (Bradley MichaelPierce) and Judy (Kirsten Dunst), along with their Aunt Nora (BebeNeuwirth).  The kids find Jumanji, and again, the pieces move bythemselves which causes Judy to comment ""it must be microchips.""  Soonhowever, all hell is unleashed on the town, but at least the firstthrow of the correct number frees Alan (now played by Robin Williams).To save the community from the destruction, they have to finish thegame and to do this they must find Sarah (now played by Bonnie Hunt)and get her to play too.       The logo for this show should have been a whirlwind.  Gettingsucked into the game is pictured as a whirlwind, and the frantic andmarvelous pacing by director Joe Johnston sweeps the audience in aswell.  A wonderful roller coaster of a good time at the movies to useanother metaphor.  And funny.  The script by Jonathan Hensleigh, JimStrain, and Greg Taylor, which is based on the book by Chris VanAllsburg, is naturally hilarious with great sight gags.  Among my manyfavorites were the monkeys driving the police motorcycle and the one ofthe flood, but there were many more.  The beauty of the story itself isthat it naturally sets an horrific pace.  Be sure and take everyone tothe bathroom before entering, you will not be able to miss a minute ofthis.       After the story, the director is the one who deserves the mostcredit.  He had his actors in control and everything set up perfectly.He knew exactly what he wanted to do and executed precisely.  Thecinematography (Thomas Ackerman) with the dark and shadowy interiorswas excellent at evoking a far away jungle.  Usually extraordinaryspecial effects, as these are, dazzle the audience and focuses theaudience's attention on the mechanics of the effects.  Here, thespecial effects, i.e., all of the animals, were great, but theycomplimented the story rather than dominating it.       All of the actors were fine albeit not on par with the story orthe directing.  My favorite was Kirsten Dunst's performance of thelittle girl who told one tall tale after another.  Robin Williams waswell cast as a serious and sad character, and the director keep him incontrol so that Williams did slip into his comedic role.       JUMANJI runs a blazing fast 1:40.  It is rated PG for violence,e.g., a stampede of rhinos, but no one gets killed in the show.  Thereis no sex, nudity, smoking, etc.  Except for the violence, and that isa big except, this would have been a G rated show.  There are no swearwords in the show, a minor miracle today.  Jeffrey says he wouldrecommend it for kids 5 or 6 and up, and he enthusiastically gives ittwo thumbs up.  His dad recommends the movie, but still would cautionparents of kids under 10 that the special effects can be terrifyinglyreal.  What if you walked into your bedroom now and a real lion roaredat you from your bed?  Would you be scared?  Finally, I award it ***. ",Jumanji,PG,1995,2.5
498,"      JUNIOR is the story of a scientist (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who, asJenner did with his small pox vaccine, decides to be a human guinea pigfor his own medicine.  His medicine is for controlling pregnancy hencehe must have an egg planted in himself and actually get pregnant toprove his drug works.  And thereby make himself millions from thebiotech industry.       His partner is an OB/GYN played by Danny DeVito.  The fellowscientist working on frozen human eggs is played by Emma Thompson.       As a person who had a recurring dream when he was in his 20s thathe was pregnant, and as one who loved the director's (Ivan Reitman)last movie (DAVE), I was really looking forward to JUNIOR.  The set upof the plot is fascinating.  It is cast with great people, and it hadterrific trailers.       This is a single joke movie.  We have an increasing larger andvery realistically pregnant Schwarzenegger as a caricature of apregnant woman.  He gets to utter every cliche possible.  People tellhim he looks ""radiant"".  He complains to DeVito that he doesn't takehim out of the house enough.  He stuffs himself silly on ice cream,pickles, Chinese food, and the entire contents of the refrigerator.  Itworks okay for the first 5 minutes and then you start checking yourwatch.  I don't blame Arnold - an actor I absolutely love.  It is thescriptwriter's and the director's fault, not Arnold's.       DeVito plays DeVito.  In general he is hot and cold as an actor.In JUNIOR he is not believable or funny as an obstetrician.       The sad part is that Emma Thompson, whom I think is brilliant, istotally wasted in this movie.  It is frequently embarrassing watchingher.  She has no dialog worth remembering.  They have her doing onesight gag after another.  Typical ones are where she falls asleep onher cheese sandwich and wakes up and talks to people not realizing shehas a large piece of cheese stuck to her cheek.  In another she danceswith her paper napkin stuck to her high heel shoe until while trying toshake it off she throws the shoe onto some one's table.  Gosh, I surehad some belly laughs over that original material.       On the good side, you get to see a lot of scenes of Berkeley'sLife Sciences building plus beautiful images of living in the bestparts of San Francisco.       I give the show a single * and do not recommend it.  It iscorrectly rated PG-13 for adult themes.  It runs a very long 1:50. **** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.***  = Excellent show.

499,"      I have a theory that some actors can not read.  As proof of this Ipresent Demi Moore in THE JUROR.  If she had been able to read, surelyshe would have read the script and seen that it had bomb written onevery page.  There was probably a Surgeon General's warning on thecover about taking this job being hazardous to an actor's wealth.       As further proof of my theory, there was her recent disastrouschoice of doing THE SCARLET LETTER.  When she has good material to workwith as she did in GHOST and A FEW GOOD MEN, her incredible talentsradiate so it must be her inability to read that is causing her to makesuch poor decisions about which projects to undertake.       The plot of THE JUROR is that Annie Laird (Demi Moore) is on ajury trying a big time Mafia boss, Louie Boffano (Tony Lo Bianco), formurder.  Boffano gets The Teacher (Alec Baldwin) to threaten jurorLaird to not only vote not guilty in an open and shut case, the policeeven have a tape of Boffano talking about the murder, but to convincethe rest of the jury to vote not guilty as well.  The show is filledwith major implausibilities and improbabilities.  In an unbelievableshow, the ending manages to be even worse.  I did not think thispossible.       Annie Laird is an avant-garde artist who makes boxes people sticktheir hands in to get an artistic tactical feel.  Sure.  After thetrial begins, a creepy stranger called The Teacher comes with her toher remote cabin in the woods to see her art.  This is a set up for herto be able to use lines like, ""would you like to feel another one.""You must check your brains at the lobby or you will never be able tobuy a minute of this preposterous script.  When The Teacher isthreatening to kill her son Oliver (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), she isconsoled by The Teacher's partner in crime, Eddie (James Gandolfini),""Hey, I got a kid too.  I know what you're going through.""       The cliched hyper-spooky music by James Newton Howard has to bethe most ludicrous of the year.  The cinematography by Jamie Andersonis of the ugly, dark and dreary school with various shades of dirtyblues and grays.       I was very sad to see one of my favorite actresses, Lindsay Crousegetting a terrible part as Prosecutor Tallow.  She has to utter absurdlines as her advice to Laird on the relative danger of the mob, ""Theyalways threaten, but they don't do squat.""  On the other hand, thereare almost no good parts in this film.  Most of the film is anembarrassment as when they show Oliver, aged 12, playing pornographicvideo games for no reason.  It is completely out of character forOliver.       Even given the low quality of the script by Ted Tally based on anovel by George Dawes Green, the overacting by Moore and Baldwintransforms from merely awful into a colossal disaster.  Too baddirector Brian Gibson didn't pay more attention to the dailies and justabandon the project before it was completed and save the backers somemoney.       Is there anything good in this turkey?  Well, there are a few veryminor actors in almost trivial roles that are good.  My favorite isJack Gilpin (SOMETHING WILD and BARCELONA) playing a juror who is tiredof deliberating and ready to go home regardless, saying, ""These peopleare scum, but I don't care anymore.""       THE JUROR runs forever at 1:58.  It is rated R for bad language,sex, brief nudity, and violence.  It would probably be okay for mostteenagers, but I hope none of them waste their time seeing it.  I hatedthe show, and I feel certain you will too.  I am giving it 1/2 of a *only because I have seen worse.  At least the show is more utterlyridiculous than painfully unbearable. ","Juror, The",R,1996,1
500,"Replacing a vacationing family with a newlywed couple, ""Just Married""holds many similarities with the ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" series.Everything that could go wrong does go wrong for the protagonists,threatening to ruin their good time and tear them apart. While theGriswald family (headed by Chevy Chase's Clark) retain charm and likabilitythroughout, ""Just Married"" emphasizes the meanspirited nature of thecharacters. The result is a mediocre romantic comedy that, while certainlyfast-paced under the helm of director Shawn Levy (2002's ""Big FatLiar""), has a tendency to pick at the viewer's nerves. In a pointless prologue that makes way for an elongated flashback,Tom (Ashton Kutcher) and Sarah (Brittany Murphy) have returned froma honeymoon that has clearly not gone well. At the point of not speakingto each other, Tom drops Sarah off at her well-to-do family's mansionand returns to the grind of his radio job. Deeply upset about hisquickly unraveling marriage, Tom reminisces about he and Sarah's past.First meeting on a beach when Tom's football accidentally hit Sarahin the face as she walked her dog, they instantly became an inseparablecouple. When Sarah announces to her family that she is engaged toTom, they question his low-class roots. Sarah knows her soul matewhen she seems him, however, and she and Tom get married. Settingoff on what is supposed to be a romantic trip to Italy, their honeymoonbecomes a disastrous one from hell. The structure of ""Just Married"" is uneven. Knowing from the beginninghow bad everything turns out, it rips the suspense out of the proceedingsand weakens the obvious finale when Tom and Sarah rekindle their love.Screenwriter Sam Harper makes the dire mistake of asking the audienceto care about the characters' fate together before we have even hada chance to get to know them as individuals or as lovers. The zany hi-jinks of the honeymoon are at least amusing, for a while.An attempted quickie in an airplane bathroom is quite funny, as isa brief stay at a grimy, roach-infested hotel. Unfortunately, themajority of the film fails to take off as it should because of directorShawn Levy's unsteady experience in adequately setting up a joke formaximum impact. Too often, he sloppily shoots what is going on andexpects it to make viewers laugh with little consideration to thefact that it is often in the tight editing of comedic sequences thatrender them successful. By the time the final thirty minutes haverolled around, a series of frustratingly dumb misunderstandings areintroduced for the sole reason of creating more conflict. These scenesstrip the characters of what charisma they have had up to this point,and make a good case for why they shouldn't be together. It isn'tjust that the honeymoon has been a bad one; Sarah and Tom's problemsprimarily stem from their mutual ! immaturity. Ashton Kutcher (2000's ""Dude, Where's My Car?"") and Brittany Murphy(2002's ""8 Mile"") are on different plains as actors, and this is nevermore glaringly true than when they are sharing a scene. Kutcher makesTom a nice enough guy, but there is a tendency on his part to nottake the material seriously. Even when he is aiming for poignancyor sincerity, Kutcher always seems to be winking at the audience,as if he doesn't believe in what he's doing, or simply doesn't care.As the high-spirited Sarah, Brittany Murphy is lovely. Not since 1995's""Clueless"" has she been given the chance to strut her stuff in a straightcomedy, but she is a natural comic delight. And, unlike Kutcher, whenMurphy is asked to bring on the tears and go for truth within thedrama, she is able to fully sell it and make the viewer sympathize.The supporting performers are mostly inconsequential, although singerValeria joyfully steals all of her scenes as a sexed-up woman Tom meets in a sports bar. The final impression ""Just Married"" makes is about on par with whatis to be expected from the first major release of the new year. Whilefans of Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy may rejoice, the moviethey happen to be stuck in lacks the momentum or care needed to makeit genuinely romantic, consistently humorous, or an insightful portrait of just-marrieds.",Just Married,PG-13,2003,2
501,"In its native France, 1993's time travel comedy, ""Les Visiteurs,"" became a breakout hit that ended up outgrossing ""Jurassic Park"" in that respective year. When it was finally released in the United States, it flopped, but Hollywood's viewpoint was that all it needed was an American remake for it to become a financial success. In a rare move, the original's director, Jean-Marie Poire, and main stars, Jean Reno and Christian Clavier, have reunited for ""Just Visiting,"" which is cursorily enjoyable, but  almost instantly forgettable.  In a prologue set in 12th-century England, the honorable Count Thibault (Jean Reno) is preparing to marry his beloved Rosalind (Christina Applegate). When he becomes victim to witchcraft and ends up accidentally killing his fair love, he seeks out the help of a wizard (Malcolm McDowell) to cast a spell on him and his goofily faithful servant, Andre (Christian Clavier), to send them back in time to the moment preceding Rosalind's untimely death.  The spell goes awry, however, and Count Thibault and Andre end up awaking in Chicago, circa 2000. In an entirely different place and time than they have ever known, they are both mystified and frightened of the inventions and way of life in the modern world, standing as two fish helplessly out of water. Almost immediately after landing in the present day, they have a chance meet with Julia Malfete (Applegate, in a dual role), a great-great-great-great-great descendant of Rosalind, who takes them in and helps them in finding a way back home.  With a screenplay by Jean-Marie Poire, Christian Clavier, and John Hughes, ""Just Visiting"" takes its time in setting up the premise, but finds much physical comedy once things get going. The movie is very funny some of the time, and occasionally clever, but is so slight that it offers nothing worthwhile outside of a few laughs. The featherweight plot lacks an urgency that fails to ever involve the viewer in the goings-on, and with the end credits comes a feeling of time that could have certainly been more well-spent.  Jean Reno and Christian Clavier, as Count Thibault and Andre, expertly play two 12th-century men humorously floundering in the 21st-century, and no wonder--they played the same exact roles in ""Les Visiteurs,"" unseen by myself. Their characters never feel like anything other than pawns, though, so it is difficult to invest any interest on their returning to England and setting things right.  The American actors who surround them are all rising young actors whose involvement in such a minor, wasteful effort boggles the mind. Christina Applegate (1998's ""The Big Hit""), as both Rosalind and Julia, is a bright actress whom I've admired ever since her days on TV's ""Married...with Children,"" and she is very good here, trying to keep a straight face amidst the insanity that is brought with two men from medieval times transplanted in the year 2000. Matt Ross (2000's ""American Psycho""), as Julia's slimy fiancee; Bridgette Wilson-Sampras (2001's ""The Wedding Planner""), as his mistress; and Tara Reid (2000's ""Dr. T and the Women""), as a free spirit who catches the eye of Andre, have one-dimensional supporting roles.  As a movie that just happens to be playing on cable late one night, ""Just Visiting"" might be a harmless way to spend an hour-and-a-half before heading to sleep. As a  theatrical release, its aspirations are hopeless, and its chance of financial success is about as promising as ""Battlefield Earth 2."" Hollywood Pictures would have been best off had they just left well-enough alone. ",Just Visiting,PG-13,2001,2
502,"K-PAX, a ONE ALIEN FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST story, concerns a being whomay or may not be human and who goes by the name of Prot.  Prot is played inanother wonderful performance by Kevin Spacey who gives his all to what isessentially a one-note character.  Jeff Bridges plays Prot's examiningpsychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell. As in the recent HAPPY ACCIDENTS, in which the central character might be atime-traveler or just a wacko, Prot may be an alien, a crazy alien or justcrazy.  As the story develops, it isn't quite clear where it is headed andto what extent it will resolve the central issues it poses.  Will it, likethe film LIMBO, leave most of the audience frustrated with its lack ofresolution, or will the answers be spelled out with some clarity?  As themovie evolves, most will probably hope to learn that Prot is exactly what heclaims to be, a guy from another planet who has mastered flying at seventimes the speed of light. Asked by the cops who first find him to take off his sunglasses, he tellsthem that he'd rather not since ""Your planet is really bright.""  Prot, wholooks sort of like a homeless guy, has hypersensitive eyesight which allowshim to see even ultraviolet light.  He also has some amazing astronomicalknowledge ""Let's hope extraterrestrials qualify for Medicaid,"" Mark comments when hefirst gets the bizarre case.  Prot is disarmingly funny.  He tries toreassure the doc by telling him, ""Don't worry.  I'm not going to leap out ofyour chest.""  Another time, as he munches on a banana like an elephant,eating peel and all, Prot says smiling, ""Your produce alone is worth theworth the trip."" K-PAX, directed clumsily by Iain Softley (HACKERS and THE WINGS OF THEDOVE), meanders when it should stay focused and has trouble making the shiftfrom the relatively comedic first half to the more serious second.  Themovie's two leads, Spacey and Bridges, are quite good, but the supportingcast isn't.  Mary McCormack, in particular, brings nothing to the part ofMark's wife. Our audience broke into applause at the end so they must have really likedit.  In the car afterwards, I heard various interpretations of the story,especially the ending, from my wife and son.  Personally, I would havepreferred a slightly different ending resolution, but the one chosen isfairly satisfying.  Suffice it to say that you will have things to talkabout on the drive home. K-PAX runs a little too long at 2:05.  It is rated PG-13 for ""a sequence ofviolent images, and brief language and sensuality"" and would be acceptablefor kids around 11 and up. My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film ***.  He thought the plot was very,very interesting, and he liked the twists along the way.

503,"If a person over the age of 12 walks into a movie called ""KangarooJack,"" it would probably be best if they were to lower their expectationsfirst. How worthwhile, after all, could a lived-action film be inwhich there is a scene where a kangaroo belts out the lyrics to ""Rapper'sDelight?"" The surprise, then, is that ""Kangaroo Jack"" is far betterthan it has any right to be (and for the curious, the singing kangaroobit is thankfully only a dream). Silly and inconsequential, but alsopain-free and passably entertaining, it is an unlikely action-comedythat is fast-paced enough to capture the attention of children, andsmart enough (relatively speaking, of course) to make it fully tolerable for adults. Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis Fucci (Anthony Anderson)are long-time best friends who unintentionally are always gettingthemselves into predicaments. When Charlie's crooked crime boss stepfatherSal (Christopher Walken) gives them a package with $50,000 insideand orders them to travel to the Australian Outback to give it toa mystery man named Mr. Smith (Marton Csokas), Charlie and Louis haveno choice but to accept the assignment. Once there, their luck quicklyruns out when they accidentally hit a kangaroo with their rental jeep.Believing it to be dead, they dress the marsupial up in Louis' jacketto take pictures, only for it come to and escape. The problem is,the jacket the kangaroo has on is carrying the money they need to deliver. Energetically directed by David McNally (2000's ""Coyote Ugly""), ""KangarooJack"" is more fun than could possibly have been expected. As withpractically any movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, it opens up withan exciting, if pointless, car chase, and continues with a seriesof comedic and death-defying action setpieces. As written by SteveBing and Scott Rosenberg, the dialogue is occasionally quite wittyand the kangaroo antics amusing. It only helps that the special effectsare top-notch, digitally bringing the kangaroo to life with equalparts believability and outlandishness. A climactic action scene setover a cliff boasts real craftsmanship and even some suspense. For what is being billed as family entertainment, however, ""KangarooJack"" includes enough questionable material making one wonder whataudience the makers really had in mind. The sporadic juvenile humor,including a sorely unfunny flatulence joke, oftentimes has troublemixing comfortably with the sexual innuendo and gun violence on display.Additionally, one of the villains is seen several times wearing anecklace with an upside-down cross--a character trait that holds nopurpose and is completely out of place. If ever there was a film thatpushed the boundaries of the PG rating, it is this one. As for the actors, they are clearly having loads of fun, upping theenergy level around every corner. It is no secret that Anthony Anderson(2002's ""Barbershop,"" 2000's ""Me, Myself & Irene"") is a gifted comedian,and here he is rightfully thrown to the forefront as Louis after astring of standout supporting roles. As Charlie, Jerry O'Connell (2001's""Tomcats"") makes for a likable leading man and plays off of Andersonwith an easygoing chemistry. While having less to do than the boys,Estella Warren (2001's ""Driven"") is charismatic as Jessie, an Americanoutbacker who helps Charlie and Louis in their quest to retrieve themoney from the fast-moving kangaroo. Meanwhile, Christopher Walken(2002's ""Catch Me If You Can"") returns to his usual bad guy roles,and makes little more than a forgettable cameo. ""Kangaroo Jack"" won't be winning any awards come next winter, butif there ever was a category for ""Worst-Looking Movie That TurnedOut To Be Good,"" this one would deserve a spot within the nominations.High-spirited and even endearing (with a zippy soundtrack that includes,appropriately, the 80's classic ""Down Under"" by Men at Work), ""KangarooJack"" is an enjoyable and undemanding way to spend 87 minutes. ",Kangaroo Jack,PG,2003,2
504,"      Robert Altman is perhaps the most unreliable of the greatdirectors.  His SHORT CUTS was one of my favorite films in 1993.  Hislist of movies includes as many failures as successes, but hisgreatness stems from his best movies.  I have not seen all of hisfilms, but I nominate KANSAS CITY as a surefire candidate for thebottom of the list.       The script by Robert Altman and Frank Barhydt is such a mess thatdescribing the plot will not convey the abyss into it sinks theaudience.  In the 1930s in Kansas City a black gangster named SeldomSeen (Harry Belafonte) is holding a white hoodlum named Johnny O'Hara(Dermot Mulroney).  In order to get her man back, gun moll and JeanHarlow wannabe Blondie O'Hara (Jennifer Jason Leigh) kidnaps CarolynStilton (Miranda Richardson).  She demands that Mr. Stilton get thegovernor to get the Pendergas Democratic machine to force Seldom Seento release Johnny.       To further complicate matters Mr. Stilton is an advisor toPresident Roosevelt and is on a train to Washington.  Moreover there isan election is in progress in Kansas City which is keeping all of thepoliticians busy.  The Pendergas machine, which is supposedly the onlytrue part of the story, is getting drunks from all over the state tovote ""10-12 times each"" for the Democrats using the names off oftombstones.       This is a highly confusing and contrived story.  None of it isclear at first, but once you figure it out, you will not care.  I spentmost of my time with mouth opened in shock at how appalling bad thisfilm is.  Let me cover just a few examples.  Belafonte is pathetic.  Hetalks non-stop, but since he mumbles all of his lines and talks in awhisper, little of what he says can actually be heard.  That is thegood news.  When he accidentally reverts to a normal voice, you realizethat his lines are all drivel.  He even has to give a racist andanti-Semitic joke.  Sad.       As truly awful as Belafonte's performance is, Leigh is much worse.She sounds like Bugs Bunny trying to sound like Jean Harlow.  It is sobad that you find yourself laughing sometimes at Leigh's acting, andthis movie is not a parody.  She too is given ridiculous and clicheddialog like, ""Move over toots.""  She is so gratingly bad, that you wantto cover your ears when her mouth starts to move in case she is aboutto make another one of those terrible noises camouflaged as speech.       All of the acting is terrible.  The only variable is how bad.  Theleast miserable work is delivered by Richardson as the druggie wife.Richardson looks like she wishes she were anywhere else but in thispicture, which at least shows some good taste.       Okay, so the movie is not a total waste.  There is some good jazz,and the old cars and the sets (Stephen Altman) are fun to watch.  Thisis not enough to keep you confined to the theater for what seems likean eternity but is only two hours.  Escape if you find yourself caughtin there.  Being a critic, I saw it all, but you shouldn't have to.  Itis a completely pointless show that is incomprehensible.  Finally, justwhen you think Altman's film has hit bottom,  it manages to come upwith an ending even worse than the rest of the picture.       KANSAS CITY runs 1:55, but you will see in two minutes what astinker it is and leave.  It is rated R.  There is nudity, drug usageincluding snorting cocaine, gory spilled guts style violence, and badlanguage including lots of use of the F and the N words.  I would keepall human beings away from the show, but if kids want to see it, Ithink they should be at least mature teenagers.  I hate this show andam sure most people will.  I generously give it 1/2 of a star. ",Kansas City,R,1996,0.5
505,"Cleverly timed for the Passover and Easter season, this isan amusing comedy about ""The God Squad,"" two pious but unconventionalyoung men of religion, directed by actor Edward Norton, who is usuallyassociated with meaty dramas like ""Primal Fear,"" ""The People vs. LarryFlynt,"" ""American History X"" and ""Fight Club."" Norton also playsFather Brian Kilkenny Finn - a Roman Catholic priest. Brian's bestfriend since childhood is now a Jewish rabbi named Jake Schram, playedby Ben Stiller. They're living near one another on New York's UpperWest Side when Anna Reilly, a young woman whom they grew up withreturns to the city on business. That's Jenna Elfman of ""EDTV"" and""Dharma & Greg."" So, instead of one of the old jokes that begins, ""Apriest and a rabbi and a woman walk into a bar and....,"" this plotignites when a priest and a rabbi both care deeply for the samewoman. And this is no ordinary woman. She's a high-powered, cellphone-addicted workaholic who firmly believes that with her help Godcould have created the world in just three days, not seven. But she'scertainly not the ""nice Jewish girl"" whom the synagogue elders hadenvisioned for their rabbi. And what about the priest's vow ofcelibacy? The supporting cast is terrific: Anne Bancroft as Jake'smother, Eli Wallach as an open-minded rabbi, and Milos Forman as acompassionate priest. It's just too bad that first-time directorNorton didn't call ""cut"" more often when actor Norton's scenes went ontoo long and that Stuart Blumberg's utterly predictable script gets abit verbose, but on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Keeping theFaith"" is a frothy, feel-good 7. In an age of cynicism, it's anamiable, old-fashioned romantic comedy, a light-hearted date movie. ",Keeping the Faith,PG-13,2000,2.5
506,"      KICKING AND SCREAMING is a good, but too frequently trite movieabout the superficiality and meaninglessness of young people's livestoday.  It tells the story of a group of boys just graduating fromcollege, and although there are many girls in the cast, they are insecondary roles.  It is being billed as a droll comedy, but it reallyisn't.  The movie at its best is an insightful satire on youngadulthood.  I laughed a couple of times, but more often I was eithertouched by the dialog or just bored.       First time writer and director Noah Baumbach assembled a cast oftypical college kid looking actors and actresses.  Most have been inother shows about Generation Xers that either I have never seen or thatI hated, i.e., shows like NAKED IN NEW YORK or AMATEURS.  None had beenin the absolutely wonderful BEFORE SUNRISE which is proof positive thatshows about people in their 20s can be both well made and notdepressing.       In KICKING AND SCREAMING's circle of friends are Grover (JoshHamilton), Max (Christopher Eigeman), Skippy (Jason Wiles), and Ottis(Carlos Jacott).  The perpetual student and local bartender, Chet (EricStoltz) has ""taken every class in school"" and yet is still a student.Chet says that he can not understand why people want to be lawyers ordoctors, when they can be students.  Chet is also the only oneinterested in real knowledge.  The others spend their time in makebelieve trivia game shows and appear to have vast surface knowledgeabout everything like ""the names of eight movies where monkeys played aleading role"", but no interest in the meaning of anything.  Onesemester Skip takes only: Ethics, Scandinavian Literature, andPersonality.       Their girlfriends are Jane (Olivia D'Abo), Miami (Parker Posey),and Kate (Cara Buono).  Finally, Elliott Gould, an actor who was neververy good, is a complete embarrassment in this movie as Grover's dad.He demonstrate what happens to a bad actor when he goes down hill.Luckily, he has a limited number of scenes.       Two of the main girls in the movie, Jane and Miami, have anunusual way to flirt with boys.  They take the retainers out of theirmouths and hold them like cigarettes or twirl them around their fingersand then get their boyfriends to hold them.  Weird.       The movie has way too many failed attempts at sight gags.  Jacott,who is almost as bad as Gould, wears a pajama top with a tie to thegraduation party.  In another scene, someone breaks a glass in hiskitchen and then puts a sign that says ""broken glass"" over it ratherthan sweeping it up.  Baumbach should have concentrated on the dialogwhich is the high point of the show and given up on the sight gags.       Baumbach's dialog ranges from the insightful to the bizarre.  Chetis the philosopher even when serving drinks.  To a regular who thinksChet is nuts, Chet muses, ""If Plato is a fine red wine, then Aristotleis a dry martini.""  In another scene, Max, talking about his parentssays, ""It's like my real parents were assassinated, and they were nextin line for the job.  They fight a lot, but they'd never split.""  Janekeeps calling Grover from Prague and leaving messages on his answeringmachine about everything, even her tour of Auschwitz.       Although the guys and gals hang out a lot, none of them have morethan a superficial interest in each other or in life itself for thatmatter.  I found this part of the movie believable but incredibly sad.The kids smoke a lot, and drink all of the time.  I am sorry to reportthat movie seems to say that you can drink Scotch and Colt 45 maltliquor with one large swig after another, and yet never get mushmouthed, stumble, or have it in any way affect your body or yourbehavior.  Since the film is clearly targeted at the 12-29 age groups,it is freighting that this movies trivializes alcoholism so much.  Mostkids in the show have major drinking problems that the picture makesalmost invisible.       Other than the two pieces of terrible acting mentioned previously,the other actors and actresses were good.  Eric Stoltz who needs gooddirection to be effective got it from Baumbach.  Stoltz has beenpathetic in some films (NAKED IN NEW YORK and SAY ANYTHING) and quitegood in others (ROB ROY and THE WATERDANCE).  Here he was the bestperson in the cast.       The almost sepia colored photography by Steven Bernstein and thedepressing and lifeless costumes by Mary Jane Fort add to the overallmoroseness of the show.  Bernstein likes using a series of black andwhite stills that dissolve into a lightly colored set of stills whichthen dissolve into a live action scene.  It is a technique that workswell at focusing the audience's attention on the character'sexpression.       KICKING AND SCREAMING runs a quick 1:34 thanks to editing by JulieDole.  It is rated R for heavy drinking that teaches a bad lesson,heavy smoking (ditto), some bad language, some nudity, a little sex,but no violence.  If you let your teenagers go, go with them if you canand talk about the movie afterwards, especially the drinking, thesmoking, and the real reasons for going to college.  This could be agood opportunity to open up some communication with them.  I foundmyself touched by the movie, and although Baumbach's film showed a lotof potential, too much was unrealized for me to be able to recommendit.  I give the movie my average movie rating of **. ",Kicking and Screaming,R,1995,2
507,"      After the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobilewrecking yard, out steps a steel-gray, human-like creature withaquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit.  Spencer, the boy whoobserves this, having seen his fill of science fiction flicks, figuresthis thing must be a robot from outer space.       With the exception of Disney and a few others, most studios viewchildren's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product andthereby make a quick profit.  STAR KID stands out as that rare kids'film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative.       Remember, the robot?  It wasn't one at all but rather a ""Phase OneAssault Cyborsuit."" The Cyborsuit is actually a prototype combatenhancer developed by the Trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrievalwhen they are under attack from the invading Broodwarriors.       The significant twist in the story is that Spencer gets to goinside the Cyborsuit, and the Cyborsuit, nicknamed Cy, has plenty ofspunk.  Cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including wordslike ""cool.""  Upon hearing that ""command,"" Cy starts rapidly decreasingthe temperature in the Cyborsuit until Spencer screams for him to stop.And when Cy speaks, we see Spencer's view, the backside of Cy's lipsand eyes.       As 12-year-old Spencer, Joseph Mazzello from the JURASSIC PARKfilm series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy andinitially tongue-tied kid.  Even when enclosed in his powerful newCyborsuit, he has his fears but he learns to overcome them.       ""If you run away, things don't get better, whether it's bullies,spiders, or girls,"" his science teacher advises him after he hasdifficulties dealing with all three.  Turbo (Joey Simmrin), theschool's chubby bully, beats up on him, spiders frighten him, and, mostembarrassing of all, he can't speak when in the presence of hiswould-be girlfriend.  With his Cyborsuit on, he learns some braverythat transcends his time inside Cy.       Spencer lives with his Dad and his older teenage sister Stacey,played by a smart-mouthed Ashlee Levitch, who looks like a youngerSarah Jessica Parker.  Stacey derides her brother, whom she barelytolerates, by referring to him only as ""the fungus.""       This whole setup for Spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funnylife makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirthand empowerment.  The beauty of Mazzello's performance is that you canvicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goesafter the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget.  Theensuing mayhem has some of the HOME ALONE antics, but the slapstick iskept tightly under control by writer and director Manny Coto so thatone never feels embarrassed to be laughing.       The romantic angle is handled ever so delicately.  When Cy wishesto know if Spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire,Michelle (Lauren Eckstrom), his eyes open wide in revulsion.  ""Matewith her!"" Spencer exclaims.  ""Pllllleeeeease, I just like her that'sall.""       The show has many funny twists.  In one, Cy sees a man in aBarney-like costume and begins firing at him, thinking he is an alienlife-form.  Soon things get way out of hand, and Cy and Spencer have tobeat a hasty retreat.       As proof positive of the show's class, it actually containstasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids'picture, didn't you?  Cy cannot allow Spencer to leave the Cyborsuit,and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet andhilarious.  The director's staging of this sequence is one of thefilm's more charming moments.  Oh, and eating is pretty funny too.       Spencer, whose idol is the comic book character ""MidknightWarrior,"" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a Broodwarriorcomes to capture the Cyborsuit.  Spencer's valiant battle gives him achance to find his mettle.  And the action sequences in the battlemanage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventivenessand lacking the usual repetition.       For a family movie mixing humor, fantasy, and action, STAR KIDdelivers.  Although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want tosee without kids, with them you'll have a magical time with arelatively straightforward but well developed story.  You'll be rootingfor and laughing with Spencer and his buddy Cy all the way through. ","Kid, The",PG,2000,2.5
508,"      KIDS is a film by first time director Larry Clark about a group of kidsfrom about 10 to 15 years in age.  They are a culturally diverse group ofboys and girls who share a common trait, they represent a good parent'sworst nightmare and they have zero moral values.  Let me warn you upfrontthat as a parent, watching this show was about as enjoyable as havingboiling oil poured over my body.  Non-parents may be able to view the moviemore dispassionately and give it higher marks.  On the other hand, thepeople who should probably see KIDS are parents, especially poor to mediocreones.  Having thus been forewarned, let me continue with the review.       KIDS tells the story of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and Jennie (ChloeSevigny), and their friends Ruby (Rosario Dawson), Harold (Harold Hunter),Darcy (Yakira Peguero), Casper (Justin Pierce), and many others.  Tellyspends all of his waking hours plotting ways to seduce very young girls intohaving sex for the first time.  When he is not busying doing this, he andhis friends are drinking malt liquor, doing drugs, stealing things, trashinghouses, lying constantly, and demonstrating all of the traits associatedwith what was known as hoodlum behavior in a more genteel age.       Although the script by Harmony Korine does not show any of the kids ashaving positive attributes, it does portray the girls as sort of willingvictims.  Given that statistics show that teenage mothers have typically hadliaisons with men in their early 20s, this depiction of girl as victim maynot be inaccurate.  In this movie, the kids were painted in degrees of evil,but the worst were the boys.  A set of frightening images all around.  Themost graphic horror movies are nothing compared to KIDS.       Although the filming does not have the hand held camera instability ofa documentary, overall, the script and especially the low quality of theacting makes you think you are watching a poor documentary of an extremelyimportant subject.  I read the director had the kids ad lib a lot.  Thepicture feels as if they cast them all in a single day on the street andtold the kids to just act natural.  I suspect it was more organized thanthat, but it feels pretty amateurish.  The depressing and filthy sets add toits documentary feel.       The boys and the girls in the movie are obsessed with sex.  They talkabout it constantly, and do it when not busy with drinking, getting stonedand passing out, or other such activities.  They all act as if they hadfried their brains with drinking and drugs years ago and thereby reducedtheir IQ levels to under 80.  Low mumbling and foul language is the way theycommunicate.  You may wish many of the scenes were subtitled.       Most of the movie is about Jennie and her quest for Telly after shefinds he got her HIV positive with her only sexual encounter ever.  Themovie totally ignores the possibility of teen pregnancy and of gettingthrown in jail, yet has a girl get AIDS with a single incident.  Therelative likelihood of the problems were totally out of proportion.       KIDS runs 1:30, and I saw every painful minute of it, but wish Ihadn't.  It is unrated because the MPAA board was going to give it an NC-17and since the producer wanted kids to be able to see KIDS, he released it asunrated instead.  There is no way I would let a kid see this show.  It isperhaps useful material for adults but could be misinterpreted by kids.  Onthe other hand, most of the people in the audience I was at seemed to beabout 18.  I wondered what they thought of it.  Beside all of the horrormentioned above, it has extreme violence which is treated as nothing by thekids in the movie.  So we may have killed someone; so what.  One of thekids, I think Casper, sums the kids' philosophy when he says ""when you areyoung, not much matters"".  I can not actually recommend this show that makesKafka look like an optimist, but if you do go, you may gain some insights,depressing as the film may be.  I award KIDS ** for risk taking and chillingrealism.  Were I not a parent, perhaps I might have been able to view itmore charitably and give another half star or so. ",Kids,NR,1995,2
509,"You're a single woman, an incurable romantic, who lives inAnytown USA but longs to take up residence in Camelot. Youdream that Merlin will conjure up a Galahad or Lancelot and thatyour garden will be guarded over by a large sword stuck tightlyin stone. Your friends tell you to come down to earth, so you goto Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" where you find out that, yes,the title character probably did exist, a half-Roman, half-Britishfellow by the name of Lucius Artorius Castus, that Lancelot andGalahad are as handsome as you imagined, but then you wakeup from your reverie. You see this new, de-romanticizedversion of Arthur. You note that Clive Owen in the title role(along with the rest of the cast and crew) is taking a biggergamble than he ever did in ""Croupier,"" and that while you mightbe wide-eyed at the final battle scene between the Arthur-Merlinalliance against the dirty Saxons, you'll write even that off astypical, hackneyed, seen-it-done-that-in-""The Last Samurai"" andscores of other action pics. You may go home and open aphysics book to see how arrows shot at 45-degree angles overan Irish landscape the size of a football field can kill scores ofwell-armored warriors. In this version Arthur, in the service of Rome with the knightsof the Round Table, including Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad(Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Gawain (Joel Edgerton),Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson), isready to accept discharge from the legions when the bishop tellshim that discharge papers are his, but only after one moreassignment. (You'd almost think that writer David Franzoniwants us to think of our soldiers in Iraq whose discharge wasput on hold by the Bush administration.) He has to go to warto bring back the pope's favorite godson, but that part of thestory gets kind of lost in the fighting. We're not in the fifteenthcentury of the Camelot legend but in the down-and-dirty fifthwhen the Roman legions were being besieged by Saxons,Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Huns and assorted rabble determined,like America's enemies today, to crush Western civilization. AsRome exits from Britain, Merlin and Arthur, former enemies,make an alliance against a common enemy_something likeSunni and Shiites banding together today against theirliberators. The best thing about this picture is the chief villain,the Saxon Cerdic (Stellan Skargard) known to Arthur as simply""Saxon,"" a chap fond of saying ""kill them all and burn thevillage."" Before the big battle, Arthur frees Guinevere (Keira Knightley,who turns out to be a handful on the battlefield), as the lady hasbeen incarcerated for practicing paganism. Over the next fewweeks, though Guinevere is destined to pad down with Arthur,she does cast a few glances toward Lancelot, but one wonderswhat she sees in him or any of the other knights since nobody,not even the female warrior, is blessed with the slightestcharacter development. When Arthur ultimately decides that he's no longer fighting forRome but for a higher cause, we strain our ears to hear that,like our president today, his higher cause is freedom_to thecheers of the unwashed in the background. Huh? Freedomfrom what? Not even the alleged slavery is given anyexploration, so we're about as in the dark about Arthur's motiveas we are about Mr. Bush's. All in all, a forgettable epicdrowned out by music and, speaking of drowning, there is a niftyscene that will remind biblical scholars of the parting of the RedSea.  ",King Arthur,R,2004,1
510,"      Director Doug Ellin's KISSING A FOOL, released earlier this year,is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in anartificial story.  Like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would beimpossible to overlay a laugh track on it, the movie meanders alonginsulting the viewers' intelligence in almost every frame.       The script by James Frey and the director is filled with vapidactors who read meaningless lines you've heard before.  (""I'm notwearing any underwear,"" the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster, Max,in what she assumes will be a sure-fire come-on line.)       Max, Chicago's biggest playboy, decides to get married after awhirlwind love affair with Sam, short for Samantha.  Max and Sampossess two irritating personalities, and they hold little chemistryfor each other or the audience.       Max is played without any style by David Schwimmer.  Schwimmer,whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality, makesan unlikely lover.  His costar, Mili Avital as Sam, is cut from thesame cloth, so they can be argued to be a matched pair.  After all,people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other,ditto for similar looks, so why shouldn't the personality-challenged beattracted?       The implausible plot has Max asking his best friend, Jay (JasonLee), to hit on Sam as a test.  Jay is supposed to try to get her tosleep with him, but stop short of the actual act.  Max, beingpromiscuous by nature, worries that his future bride may have the sameneed to sleep around as he does.  The idea of flirting with thebeautiful Sam makes Jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work.Neither the script nor the actors make this test believable.       ""The 64,000 question is: How do you know you're with the wrongperson so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life?""Jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousnessto the film.       Finally, there is the film's attempt at physical comedy.  Jay'sex-girlfriend Natasha (Vanessa Angel) becomes infatuated with Jay againonce she thinks he is going out with someone else.  Natasha rips Jay'sshirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa.  As she throws herhair on his bare chest, she demands he pull it.  This is supposed to befunny?       Most films have some saving grace. Some bit part was doneespecially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest ofthe picture wasn't. KISSING A FOOL, on the other hand, has nothing torecommend it.       KISSING A FOOL runs 1:45.  It is rated R for profanity andsexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers. ",Kissing a Fool,R,1998,1
511,"Picture it: Medieval times, circa 14th-century. A jousting competition is about to begin at the town stadium. And the crowd is stomping their feet and clapping their hands to Queen's ""We Will Rock You."" Yes, you read that right, and it is this ingenious, bold mixture of the past and present that makes ""A Knight's Tale,"" directed by Brian Helgeland (1999's ""Payback""), a worthwhile motion picture.  William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is a young man whose estranged father was a peasant, passing down such lineage to him. He is broke, and desperately wants to make something of his life. Then it hits him--learn jousting, pose as a knight, compete in the tournaments, and gain money, honor, and respect. With the help of his two buddies, Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk), William becomes Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland, and turns out to be a natural at the sport. A force to be reckoned with, he single-handedly succeeds in making everyone believe he is of ""noble birth,"" and becomes the most talented jouster in the land, next to the slimy Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell). William has to be careful, though. If just one person discovers his true identity, the trouble that will follow him will be great.  So the story is thin and unoriginal, more or less a smaller-scale version of 2000's ""Gladiator,"" and there isn't a whole lot to ponder when it's over. But that music! More often than not, ""A Knight's Tale"" is a rollicking good show that dazzles each and every time writer-director Helgeland treats the audience to another classic rock song. While using present-day music in a 14th-century setting may feel like nothing more than a gimmick at first glance, it acts as so much more. Not only do the songs fit effortlessly into the proceedings, tightly edited by Kevin Stitt, but they also pose as a bridge for the viewer, in connecting these medieval characters with modern-day people. From War's ""Low Rider,"" to Bachman Turner-Overdrive's ""Takin' Care of Business,"" to David Bowie's ""Golden Years,"" to Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys are Back in Town,"" to AC/DC's ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" ""A Knight's Tale"" plays like a who's who of popular rock music of the 1970s and '80s, and is a genuine treat whenever the soundtrack is pumped up and letting loose its goods.  The songs aren't the only feature of today that have been transferred to the past. The characters all boast modern values and attitudes, and are all the more easily relatable due to this fact. Occasionally, there will also be slang used (i.e. ""Hellooooo!""), and the movie apparently unearths how the Nike swoop was created. ""A Knight's Tale"" has fun with itself, and it is the intermittent mixing of completely different eras that gives the movie its reason for being. Without it, the film would, admittedly, be generic in the most painfully dull way, and have not a lick of creativity.  The first time he has been asked to carry a movie on his own, the dashing Heath Ledger (2000's ""The Patriot"") has an undeniably strong screen presence, and his character of William is both likable and interesting--the type of person you enjoy hanging around for over two hours. Opposite him is newcomer Shannyn Sossomon, as the beautiful Jocelyn, the quintessential love interest whom William falls head over heels for. Sossomon plays Jocelyn as a smart, witty young woman, and gives her more dimension than the role probably had, as written.  Lending adequate support are Mark Addy (1997's ""The Full Monty"") and Alan Tudyk (2000's ""28 Days""), as William's lovable sidekicks; Paul Bettany (1998's ""The Land Girls""), very funny as writer Geoffrey Chaucer, who becomes William's spokesperson; Laura Fraser (1999's ""Titus""), as a canny, resourceful peasant girl who befriends William; and Rufus Sewell (1998's ""Dark City"") as the token bad guy, and William's competing nemesis.  At 132 minutes, ""A Knight's Tale"" desperately needed scissors to cut off the excess fat. The story is relatively simple, and the motions that it goes through are predictable every step of the way. As a 100-minute entertainment, ""A Knight's Tale"" would have been a little easier to give in to. As is, it is a good movie--nothing great, mind you--that works in spite of its flaws, first and foremost due to the offbeat approach with which director Helgeland tackled the project. It's been years since music has been so smoothly, and delightfully, integrated into a film. ","Knight's Tale, A",PG-13,2001,2.5
512,"KNOCKAROUND GUYS is a mediocre Mafia movie that was released to theaters foronly one reason -- the newfound popularity of one of its stars, Vin Diesel(XXX).  After languishing on the studio's shelf for three years, the movie,written and directed by ROUNDERS's writing team of Brian Koppelman and DavidLevien, was dusted off and shipped to theaters with the hope of cashing in onDiesel's cachet.  It has direct-to-video written all over it.  It does leave onewondering if the reason the cinematography appears so dark and dull is that theycouldn't get all of the grime off of the negative.  The setup has the boss's boy, Matty Demaret (Barry Pepper), trying to prove tohis pop, Benny 'Chains' (Dennis Hopper), that he really is a chip off the oldblock.  Circumstances conspire, of course, to screw up his first job for dearold dad.  With a bag full of a half million in cash lost in a tiny town, Mattycalls on his buddies, Taylor Reese (Vin Diesel), Johnny Marbles (Seth Green) andChris Scarpa (Andrew Davoli), to help locate the loot.  Taylor is the barroombrawler, Johnny is the smart-aleck doofus and Chris is the sweet-talkingplayboy.  The four of them use all of their limited talents to find the bag. Their plan is to beat up the meanest guy in town with the hopes that whoeverstole the bag will hear of this and beg them to take it back.  John Malkovich, with his best Brooklyn accent, is onboard as Teddy Deserve,Benny Chains's right-hand man.  Easily the most interesting character is thetown's larcenous sheriff (Tom Noonan, who played the Tooth Fairy in MANHUNTER). A tall, lanky guy with a big white hat, the sheriff is the only character thathas you guessing -- and caring -- about what he is going to do next.  Speakingof guessing, the story's ending has a few nice twists, or they would be if theyweren't so easy to predict.  Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix, thereis no real reason to see KNOCKAROUND GUYS.  Wait for video -- and then don'trent it.  KNOCKAROUND GUYS runs 1:32.

He got himself a large sum of counterfeit dollar bills and wants to sell them for a million US$ in real money. Frankie decides to help his friend in the deal, but the routine exchange turns into bloody shootout. One of the victims is undercover cop and his sister Colleen (played by Hilary Swank) decides to track down his killers and take the justice in her own hands.  Low budget of this film corresponds with the level of ambition displayed by its makers. The plot recycles many obligatory elements of low budget crime movies (vengeance as the prime motive for one of the protagonist, good guys who don't turn out so good at the end) and combines them with Tarantinoesque portrayal of small time criminals as protagonists. Even the less experienced viewers won't have much problem in deciphering the film's ending at least thirty minutes before the closing credits. The only interesting thing about KOUNTERFEIT is casting - Bruce Payne, specialised for the roles of charismatic and over-the-top villains in low budget films, plays somewhat different character here, while future ""Oscar"" winner Hilary Swank makes very little impact in stereotypical and thankless role.

514,"    In 1949 the Communists took over the mainland of Chinaand by 1950 had solidified their hold on the previouslyindependent Tibet.  The Dalai Lama, after giving the politicalsituation much thought, went along with his chief adviser andfled to India to form a government-in-exile--where he stillresides today.  After you watch Martin Scorsese's film,""Kundun,"" however, you may conclude that a differentstrategy could have proved far better.  This fourteenthincarnation of Buddha--played by four actors who portray HisHoliness from the age of two to his eighteenth year--shouldhave remained in the Tibetan capital where he would havebored the entire invading Chinese army to death.     Director Scorsese could hardly have had this subtext inmind but he has perhaps unwittingly portrayed his Ocean ofWisdom (as Dalai Lama translates to English) as a youngfella with all the bedside manner of a Dr. Kevorkian and thecharm of a junior accountant working his way through theexams to become an actuary.  Well, now, nobody says thateverything Scorsese does has to carry the electricity of ""TaxiDriver.""  His ""Last Temptation of Christ"" is probably the filmmost like ""Kundun"" in that it represents one of America's greatdirectors journeying within.  But when a movie proceeds stepby step as a chronicle with banal dialogue, little action (butsome great visuals, admittedly), you might find yourselfscreaming to introduce a rugged Nazi like Brad Pitt's HeinrichHarrar from ""Seven Years in Tibet.""  Not a chance.  ""Kundun""is a meditation that would embarrass even some Zen masterswho face a blank wall for eight hours daily.  What sort oftarget audience did Scorsese have in mind for this heartfeltalbeit static drama?  Your typical fourteen-year-old wouldhave little patience for this PG-13 tale and adults will soon tireof a film which can best recommended for Philip Glass'ssuper sound track and some dazzling desert scenes filmed insouthern Morocco where hundreds of nonprofessionalTibetans were transported.  (It is, incidentally, to Morocco'scredit that the almost exclusively Muslim nation welcomedvisitors who followed a religion quite different from theirown.)     Think back to Jean-Jacques Annaud's ""Seven Years inTibet"" and recall how charming the Dalai Lama was from thetime he was a tyke through his portrayal by the 14-year-oldBhutanese actor Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk.  As a kid hewas absolutely fascinated by his telescope which he'd peerthrough constantly though there was not an apartment windowin sight.  He'd bounce up and down while watching movies onhis home projector and radiate delight in life.  ShowingBuddhist-like compassion for all living things was the easiesttask in the world for him since he shed hundreds of watts ofglee at everything he saw of a pre-Chinese derivation.  Bycontrast the two-year-old ""discovered"" by monks as thefourteenth incarnation of the spirit of Buddha is little morethan a spoiled, self-centered whelp given to bossing hisparents around and insisting that he was ""in charge.""  To hiscredit, though, he did separate two ferocious looking blackants battling in the Moroccan sands, setting them far enoughapart to live to fight another day.     What we have is a chronology that begins in 1933, the yearthat Hitler became Germany's chancellor, an event as remoteto Tibetans as the emergence of a full moon on Jupiter wouldbe to a run-of-the-mill New Yorker.  Tested surreptitiously bymonks, the two year old played by Tenzin Yeshi Paichang (ifyou're keeping score) ""selects"" the right objects laid outbefore him on a table, thus proving his near-divinity, but bythe time 1944 rolls around, the Dalai Lama is no longergiggling.  He watches the bombing of Hiroshima withastonishment and is ultimately challenged when the newCommunist government in Peking (now Beijing) insists thatTibet surrender its alleged sovereignty and become part ofChina.     The most absurd vision is a conference between the DalaiLama and General Mao Tse-tung, the latter played by RobertLin who looks as though he had just emerged from MmeTussaud's wax museum.  Mao is a heck of a nice guy at first,so unlike the dictator who ultimately sends his legions toLhasa to massacre non-resisting, colorfully costumedTibetans.  Knowing that Tibet is doomed as soon as henotices Mao's shiny, Western shoes, the Lama is faced with adecision.  Should he agree to the seventeen demands andturn his people over to these Communists?  Should he remainin Lhasa and carry out an active resistance?  Or should heflee just over the border to India and carry on a government-in-exile there?  Well, now, anyone who knows the differencebetween a Lhasa Apso and a Great Dane already remembersthe answer, and the rest is history.  The enlightenedmoviegoer will not learn much that is new, save one valuablepiece of information.  Non-violence, for which practicingBuddhists are famous, does not necessarily mean pacifism. Non-violence, as explained in Melissa Mathison's screenplay,means: cooperate where cooperation is possible, resist whenit is not.     What the picture does is provide dazzling visuals,particularly one from the Dalai Lama's nightmares of hundredsof Buddhist monks lying bloodied in the streets which, as acecameraman Roger Deakins draws his camera up and awayresembles nothing less horrible than the gruesomediscoveries made by liberating armies at Auschwitz in 1945. ""Kundun"" has its heart in the right place but emotionally isoddly distancing and intellectually ordinary.  We might sum upthe 134 minutes as providing us with a ""Hello, Dalai, wellhello Dalai...'twould be nice to have you back where youbelong."" ",Kundun,PG-13,1997,2.5
515,"""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"" written, directed and starring Steve Oedekerk(1995's ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls""), may not be a completelysuccessful spoof of the martial arts genre, but it is spirited andhas several big laughs. Reminiscent of TV's dearly departed ""MysteryScience Theater 3000,"" Oedekerk has cleverly taken the obscure 1976kung fu picture, ""Savage Killers,"" and dubbed the original dialoguewith his own comically insane screenplay. What's more, he has digitallyinserted himself and a few other actors into the source material andincluded several added scenes to create the wackiest movie you arelikely to see this year. The story is superfluous and unimportant. Oedekerk has forgone a clearlydefined plot as a means for setting up a line of loosely related skitsthat drive the laugh quotient. What we do learn is that The ChosenOne (Steve Oedekerk), as he is called, saw his parents slain as ababy at the hands of Master Pain, also known as Betty (Lung Fai).After being raised by rodents, the adult Chosen One sets out to avengehis parents by going up against the sniveling Betty, all the whilefalling in love with the pretty, whiny Ling (Tse Ling Ling). The opening five minutes of ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" are thankfullyits worst. After the misguided, even painfully unfunny and underlit,beginning setpiece in which the infant Chosen One attacks his parents'killers, the film gradually finds its footing. The peculiar idea ofredubbing and digitally changing an older movie takes some gettingused to, but once you get into the groove of things, a parade of surprisinglyfunny moments arrive.  The squealing, daffy Ling (played by Tse Ling Ling in the 1976 film,and redubbed by Oedekerk himself) is easily the most entertainingand wacky character, and whenever she is onscreen, the film is hilarious.A new sequence, in which The Chosen One goes up against a kung fucow, is another inspired bit of lunacy, but this umpteenth lampooningof 1999's ""The Matrix"" is a lazy one. Steve Oedekerk deserves major credit for taking on such an oddballproject and, for the most part, making it work. At 82 minutes, ""KungPow: Enter the Fist"" does not wear out its welcome like most spoofsdo, but it also fails to achieve anything other than being ""kind offunny, but very stupid."" As is the case with the genre, the ratioof hits to misses on the laugh meter favor the latter, but there areenough good jokes to make it an enjoyable, if unproductive, time at the movies.",Kung Pow!

516,"Because THE LADIES MAN has one of the worst trailers in recent memory, themore I saw the trailers, the less I looked forward to the film's screening.When it finally came time for the screening, I could barely force myself togo.  It turned out to be one of biggest and most enjoyable film surprisesI've had in some time.  Whereas the movie is no THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUTMARY, it is extremely funny and wonderfully sweet, although with quite araunchy brand of humor. Directed with good comedic timing by Reginald Hudlin and writtenuproariously by Tim Meadows, Dennis McNicholas and Andrew Steele, THE LADIESMAN stars Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps.  Leon is a radio talk show host wholikes to help people with their sexual difficulties.  A mixture of Dr. Ruthand Howard Stern, Leon throws out advice a mile a minute, most of itunprintable. The movie is like an African-American version of PRIVATE PARTS as it relatesLeon's life story.  With the wild wackiness of AUSTIN POWERS, the movietells us of Leon's childhood as an orphan raised by buxom bunnies in aPlayboy Mansion look-alike with a Hugh Hefner clone as his surrogate father.Having an Afro hairstyle from age 1 on, Leon is a guy who has been foreverstuck in the 70s.  His radio show's advice comes from his long experience asa ladies man, having had sex with half of the women in town.  Maybe more. Although this material could be crude and offensive, instead it is crude andfunny, thanks to Meadows's eminent likeableness.  With his little, disarminglisp, and his broad smile, he is such an easy guy to love that you canunderstand women falling for him, even if he isn't the handsomest guy on theblock.  A side-joke concerns his private part, which causes a blinding lightwhen unleashed, and his butt, which has a smiley tattooed on it. One of the reasons for the film's surprising success is the casting ofLeon's sidekick.  His radio producer and work companion, Julie, is playedwith charm and spunk by Karyn Parsons.  She is one of the few women in hislife with whom he hasn't slept.   After being thrown off of his popular radio show due to viewer complaintsand management who hates him -- again, shades of PRIVATE PARTS -- Leon goesfrom rejection to rejection as he and Julie apply for jobs at otherstations.  After promising Julie that he'll clean up his act, he finallylands a job at a small religious station.  His first guest is a nun whotalks about assuming a missionary position and traveling to Bangkok.Sweating profusely, Leon looks in danger of short-circuiting his brain as hefights back bawdy responses to the comedic softballs she unknowingly throwsat him. The supporting cast is well utilized.  Billy Dee Williams, playing abartender, serves also as the story's narrator, giving Leon's story a fairytale rendition.  Will Ferrell plays Lance, the leader of a support group(VSA - Victims of the Smiling Ass) of husbands whose wives have been caughtdallying with Leon.  A Hummer driving, Greco-Roman wrestler who has aproclivity for heavy body oil and other wrestlers, Lance turns out to bequite a song-and-dance man.  One of the film's delights is a long dancenumber with the VSA men that seems straight out of an old Rodgers andHammerstein musical.  It is well choreographed, tuneful and funny.  (I'dtrade this one number for all of DANCER IN THE DARK.) The people, including Julie's parents, who take Leon's advice, end uphappier and with a much better love life.  So it is with the movie.  Go inexpecting little and you may find the movie as charming and funny as I did.Our half-full audience certainly laughed like a packed one. THE LADIES MAN runs a lightening fast 1:24.  It is rated R for sexualcontent and language and would be acceptable for older teenagers.","Ladies Man, The",R,2000,2
517,"      English Director Kenneth Loach's last film was the brilliant andpowerful but hard to watch LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD.  This time he brings usLAND AND FREEDOM (Tierra y Libertad) about English men and women goingto Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War in 1936.       The film starts in the present with the death of an old man namedDavid.  David is played by Ian Heart who was John Lennon in BACKBEAT.In going through David's effects his granddaughter (Suzanne Maddock)learns out how he was a member of the trade unions and the BritishCommunist party who left the safety of Britain to answer the call tojoin the socialists, anarchists, and communists in Spain in theirbattle against the fascist forces of General Francisco Franco.       The movie is shown in flashback as we relive David's life as amember of the Spanish militia.  The brilliantly lit cinematography(Barry Ackroyd) and the decaying sets (Martin Johnson) evoke a feel ofthe desperation of their cause.  They are in a ragtag army and fightunder miserable conditions.  You never see Franco's forces, but somehowthe picture conveys the feeling that they must have been much betteroff since after all at least they have fancy uniforms and a real chainof command.  Nevertheless, David loves the militia and in one of hisletters writes, ""We elect the officers and everything.  It's socialismin action - not like the army back home.""  He is an idealist whothinks, ""Revolutions are contagious.""       At first the fighting is a lark with both sides trading insultsand jokes from their respective foxholes.  During this time, David isin bliss.  Soon however the militia and the film bogs down in talkfestsas thick as molasses.  The socialists, anarchists, and communists getlocked in long verbal battles over their goals.  They each wantimmediately to remake society exactly according to their recipe anddefeating Franco is only of secondary importance.  This infuriatesDavid.       The script by Jim Allen gets so wordy that you feel like screaming""enough already, back to the story.""  A little of this infighting isfascinating; extremely long scene after scene of it is not.  A typicalbattle among the leftists has the socialists thinking dirt poor farmersshould be allowed to keep their measly four acres of land whereas thecommunists believe that they should immediately collectivize everythingeven if that means they starve for a while since the collectives thusfar have proven unsuccessful.       The acting by Ian Heart is quite good.  The acting by the rest ofthe cast, Blance (Rosana Pastor), Maite (Iciar Bollain), Lawerence (TomGilroy), Vidal (Marc Martinez), and Bernard (Frederic Pierrot) is okay,but nothing special.  The historical perspectives the film providesfrom the inside of the Militia is fascinating, but the picture dragsincredibly through its long middle.  It needed much stronger editingthan Jonathan Morris provided.       LAND AND FREEDOM runs 1:49, but should have been shorter and morefocused.  It is in English and Spanish with English subtitles.  It isnot rated, but would probably be rated R.  There is no sex, no nudity,a couple of uses of the F word, and only mild violence considering thisis a war picture.  It would be fine for any teenager.  I liked a lot ofthe picture, but the long, slow, and pedantic middle was too much forme to be able to recommend it.  I do give it ** for many good parts. ",Land and Freedom,NR,1996,2
518,"The summer of laughably protracted movie titles continues with ""LaraCroft: Tomb RaiderThe Cradle of Life,"" a superior sequel to 2001's""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" in that it is a divertingly tolerable experience,rather than a numbingly dull one. One possible reason for the notableimprovements in pacing is the change in director, from the hack-styleSimon West (1999's ""The General's Daughter"") to the more stylish Jande Bont (1994's ""Speed""). If there is one thing de Bont has provenin the past, it is his adeptness in setting up and pulling off actionseq uences. However, while there are more moments with flair thanin the original fiasco, it remains a one-dimensional and suspiciously lifeless affair.  Based on the video game character, Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) isa wealthy Brit who raids tombs, and saves humanity in her spare time.This time, Lara's mission is to retrieve Pandora's Box, which liesdormant in a secret place and has the power to destroy mankind. Standingin her way is Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), who has stolen a magicalball with the power to lead anyone in its possession to the sought-afterbox. With time running out, Lara enlists the aid of ex-boyfriend andconvict Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), who still may hold feelings for her.  ""Lara Croft: Tomb RaiderThe Cradle of Life"" holds scenes of vividimagination and effectiveness, but for every one that inspires orstimulates or even frightens, there are two more that lack narrativecohesion, professionalism, and energy. The key to the franchi se'sfailure, thus far, is its confusion in how to handle the lead heroineof Lara Croft. As with Charlie's AngelsDylan, Natalie, and AlexLarais strong-willed, tough-as-nails, and sexy. Unlike the crime-fightingthreesome, however, screenwriter Dean Georgaris gives Lara no truecharacter shades, and Angelina Jolie (2002's ""Life or Something LikeIt"") keeps her role at arm's length, unable to endear herself to audiences.When an action film (or any genre, for that matter) can't even getthe viewer to care about its protagonist, then it has more than likelyfailed. Nothing much is learned about Lara in the process of the film'sadmittedly brisk-seeming two-hour running time; she is little morethan an unfocused cipher.  Fortunately, much of what surrounds the spoil-sport Lara works inspite of itself. The plot is preposterous and I wouldn't even wagera guess at what, exactly, it is about outside of the basic premise,but there are worthwhile bits. An underwater opener involving a buriedcity and a hungry shark is thrilling, as is a creative and unexpectedlyspooky climax set within a dark, creature-filled forest. Likewise,some of the stunts are awesome to watch, all the more so because thecamera shots linger long enough on the action to understand they havebeen done with a minimum of visual effects. Lara and Terry's motorcyclerace, their death-defying jump off a building wearing parasailinggear, and Lara's bamboo stick gymnastics are silly, yet fun in aneager-to-please way that the first picture didn't even attempt. Atthe same time, the stuntpersons too often feel obvious, and are notas seamless with the real actors as s the norm for big-budget filmmaking.  Angelina Jolie has turned in electric performances of emotional weightand depth, and she will undoubtedly have more such roles, but herLara Croft is not one of them. Jolie is athletic and beautiful, butshe sorely lacks heart. Ultimately, this is the case with the entirety of ""Lara Croft: Tomb RaiderThe Cradle of Life,"" a motion picturethat, like its precursor, is a joyless, emotion-free slog that neverseems to take off before the end credits have rolled. Giving viewersa reason for why they should care about, or even watch, Ms. Croftis awfully difficult when the filmmakers themselves obviously haveno idea who she is. They don't even seem to care.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,PG-13,2003,2
519,"When Tarantino became something of the ultimate authority onHollywood few years ago, many critics were taken aback byhis view of brothers Ridley and Tony Scott. BeforeTarantino's verdict Tony Scott was seen as nothing more thanuntalented hack who had just happened to be related to theauthor of masterpieces like ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER.Tarantino changed this perception by proclaiming Tony Scottto be much better director than Ridley Scott. Nowadays,Tarantino's verdict seems justified with Ridley Scottjeopardising his reputation with the series of hack jobs andTony Scott enjoying reputation of a director who couldproduce more than decent films, able to stand on its own.One of the first examples of such talent could be found inTHE LAST BOY SCOUT, 1991 action film which is probably thebest film of Tony Scott's career, but also one of the mostunderrated titles of previous few decades.  The script for this film was written by Shane Black,screenwriter best known as the author of LETHAL WEAPONseries. The protagonist is Joe Hallenbeck (played by BruceWillis), private detective that used to be highly decoratedSecret Service agent whose brilliant career ended afterconflict with US Senator Calvin Baynard (played by ChelcieRoss). Hallenbeck is now forced to work sleaziest andlowest-paid jobs in order to support his increasinglyestranged family as well as his own developing gambling andboozing habits. His latest customer is Cory (played by HaleBerry), striper and part-time prostitute who hires hisservices of bodyguard. Soon after that she is gunned down byprofessional assassins and Hallenbeck starts investigatingher murder, reluctantly taking Cory's boyfriend Jimmy Dix(played by Damon Wayans), former star of L.A. Stallions profootball team who was kicked out of the League because ofthe gambling and substance abuse. Hallenbeck and Dix soonreveal the reason for Cory's murder - tape that connectsL.A. Stallions' owner Sheldon ""Shelly"" Marcone (played byNoble Willingham) with huge corruption/gambling scheme.Before they are able to present the tape to the authorities,they become targets of assassins and must use all theirskills and abilities in order to evade ruthless andmurderous goons.  THE LAST BOY SCOUT is one of the more obscure titles inBruce Willis' filmography and there are two major reasonsfor that. First of all, many critics saw this film asnothing more than Shane Black's lame attempt to repeat hiswinning formula of LETHAL WEAPON. There are somesimilarities between two scripts - both employ raciallymixed pair of protagonists who start as complete losers andhate each other's guts before joining forces and becomingbest friends during their ordeal. But, there are also manydifferences -the contrast between Hallenbeck/Willis andDix/Wayans is never as sharp as the contrast betweenRiggs/Gibson and Murtaugh/Glover in LETHAL WEAPON. Thisscript is much tighter and action-oriented. Despite clearlymiserable state in which protagonist begin or elegiac soundsof Michael Kamen's score, the general tone of the film ismore light-hearted. This is due to extremely effectivedialogues (probably the best in their class before Tarantinoera) that provide laughs almost any second of the film andthe enormous amount of graphic and almost larpourlartistviolence that won't allow audience to take this filmseriously.  Another reason why THE LAST BOY SCOUT failed to leave muchof the impact during its premiere could be found in changingsocial climate of early 1990s. Female characters being lessthan saintly or women in general being described in everyderogatory term imaginable by protagonists - that was morethan simple anachronistic aberration in the era of PoliticalCorrectness running amok. It was unforgivable crime thatbrought stigma of misogyny to the entire film. The onlymajor exception in Shane Black's script - character ofHallenbeck's rebellious trash-talking 13-year old daughterDarian (brilliantly played by Danielle Harris) - createdanother set of controversy due to scenes in which she helpsdynamic duo and thus becomes participant of the events thatno child should ever take part of.  Controversial or not, THE LAST BOY SCOUT is veryentertaining film that brought many great talents. TonyScott as the director did more than adequate job for someonewith ""talentless hack"" reputation and proved that he canmake outstanding work with outstanding scripts (same as withTarantino's script for TRUE ROMANCE two years later). But,regardless of the spectacular and memorable action scenes(including the opening, one of the most shocking in thehistory of cinema), people who remember and enjoy THE LASTBOY SCOUT do it because of the actors. And this film hadreally great cast. Willis here does something more than toreprise his John McLane role of DIE HARD - his JoeHallenbeck is less perfect, more human and therefore moresympathetic to the audience. Black comedian Damon Wayans isalso very good and avoids the danger of being second fiddleto Willis. Both of them are, however, overshadowed by thesmall but very talented group of character actors - BadjaDjola, Jack Kehler, Kim Coates - who embodied some of themost memorable villains in the history of cinema. Many ofthem appear briefly but they leave long lasting impressionto the audience. But few of them are as effective as NobleWillingham as arrogant sports tycoon or Taylor Negron as hischillingly soft-spoken and sadistic sidekick Milo.  Often referenced as ""guilty pleasure"", THE LAST BOY SCOUT isa movie that would also deserve epithet of ""hidden gem"". ","Last Boy Scout, The",R,1991,4
520,"Oscar alert! This high-tension military prison drama is the first real contenderof the Fall season. The story begins as idolized but court-martialed three-starArmy General Irwin (Robert Redford) is delivered in handcuffs to amaximum-security military prison run by Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini) whosestunned reaction is: ""They should be naming a base after the man, not sendinghim here."" A proud West Point graduate who pled guilty to disobeying a directorder, Irwin is resigned to spending time incarcerated in the stockade, tellingfellow inmates: ""I'm not fighting anyone for anything any more."" But he's soonappalled by the brutal, sadistic manipulative techniques used by the psychotic,power-mad Colonel. ""We are soldiers - and no one can take that away from us,"" hefinally declares, igniting guerrilla warfare against injustice within the penalsystem, culminating in redemption and the triumph of the human spirit.Screenwriters David Scarpa and Graham Yost set up a classic dramaticconfrontation over leadership since the plight of the protagonist is only astough as the antagonist makes it. Director Ron Lurie infuses the film with aresonating tension, pitting Robert Redford, as the intense, charismatic herowhose quiet, understated dignity transforms his desperate, dispirited cohortsinto defiant yet disciplined soldiers, against James Gandolfini, who carries thewarden to the brink of hardcore villainy with the will and ability to kill asmany prisoners as necessary to retain control. Mark Ruffalo scores as anopportunistic bookie, Clifton Collins Jr. as an abused inmate, and Delroy Lindoas Irwin's former colleague.

521,"      ""The environmental movement of our times was sparked by there-release of Bambi in the 1950s,"" is one of many deliciously offbeatslices of wisdom from writer and director Wilt Stillman's latest film,THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO.  Full of wry, intelligent humor, Stillman'spictures (METROPOLITAN and BARCELONA) are perhaps an acquired taste,and his latest is arguably his best yet.       We are told that the story is set in ""the very early 1980s,"" and,although it is being marketed as a nostalgic disco movie, the storyreally has little to do with discos or dancing.  The movie is atalkfest that uses the disco scene and the period merely as a backdrop.       The large ensemble cast is head by a pair of female buddies,Charlotte Pingress and Alice Kinnon, who are entry level bookpublishers during the day and disco devotees at night.  In the tightlycontrolled world of disco, the doorman has gatekeeper powers that St.Peter would envy, these women are among the elite group regularlygranted admission, albeit more to hang out than to dance.  And whenthey do make it onto the floor, they have the more dancing with eachother.  Forget those guys and their hang-ups.       As filmed by John Thomas, the harsh strobes of the darkly litdisco contrast strikingly with the warm sunshine flowing into theiroffice windows during the day.  Their disco has no romantic JohnTravolta-style dancing.  (In fact one scene is devoted to mockingSATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.)  The dancers are made into quasi-buffoons intheir outlandish outfits, the best being a group dressed as charactersfrom the Wizard of Oz but with masks full of long scowls.       As the bossy Charlotte, Kate Beckinsale from SHOOTING FISH gives awinning performance.  She alternates between politely insulting andinstructing the meek Alice, played without much personality by ChloeSevigny from PALMETTO.  After learning from Charlotte that the constantuse of the word ""sexy"" is a turn-on to men, Alice tries it out on hernew date, Tom Platt (Robert Sean Leonard).  Since she knows he collectsfirst edition Scrooge McDuck comics, she tells him with as muchconviction as she can muster that ""there's something sexy about ScroogeMcDuck.""  He proceeds to write her off as a nut case.       The film comes alive with its wonderfully complex, intellectualhumor that is so dense and fast-paced that it might take severalviewings to catch it all.  One long scene has the group deconstructingthe meaning of LADY AND THE TRAMP, contemplating the various dogs'psychological motivations and envisioning possible epilogues.       Des McGrath, played with paranoid verve by Christopher Eigemanfrom METROPOLITAN and BARCELONA, likes to relate the story of how hewas traumatized by a pair of large female breasts in college and of howwomen do not realize ""how nuanced"" men's feelings are about breasts -it's more than just sexual.       The group also ponders the meanings of various lines ofShakespeare.  ""To thine own self be true"" can become bad advice if your""self"" isn't all that great in the first place.       Charlotte, whose mouth always runs several steps ahead of herbrain, argues that having VD is actually a gift, since you get toreestablish contacts with all of your old sexual partners.  Besides, itcould be worse since VD is easily treatable, unlike herpes.       Much of their logic has an Escher quality, nicely twisting back onitself.  One couple, for example, has agreed on a trial separation buthave been caught cheating by seeing each other on the sly.       And then there is Des, who claims he's gay because two days ago hesaw this guy on the ""Wild Kingdom"" TV show who caused him to realizehis true sexual orientation.  The women take this as a convolutedputdown, but he swears he's serious.  Des, who turns out to be the mostinteresting character of all, is full of reflections on life.  ""Ourbodies are not really designed for group social life,"" he observes whentheir little party breaks up into couples going off for sex.  ""We'rereally designed for pairing off.""  Des admits to being an habitual druguser, but certainly not an addict, which he is.  ""Do you think theneurological effects of caffeine are similar to those of cocaine?"" heasks Alice during a brief bout of sobriety.  Before she can answer, hethrows his face into a large cup of coffee.       Just the opposite of the ultra-confident entrepreneurs of the 90s,these 80s yuppies are depressed and fearful.  ""A lot of people won'ttake no for an answer,"" a diffident, would-be boyfriend, Josh Neff(Matthew Keeslar from WAITING FOR GUFFMAN), tells Alice.  ""I wanted youto know that I'm not one of them.  I can be discouraged."" ","Last Days of Disco, The",R,1998,3
522,"      Let's create a high concept movie.  First, we will getquintessential action writer and director Walter Hill (48 HRS., ANOTHER48 HRS., ALIENS, ALIEN 3, and WILD BILL among others).  Now we needthat high concept.  Viola, let's remake Akira Kurasawa's 1961 classicYOJIMBO (THE BODYGUARD), but here comes the great twist.  We will makeit in the style of Sergio Leone's 1964 cheap spaghetti Western FISTFULOF DOLLARS.  Westerns don't sell anymore so we will switch it to theTexas border during Prohibition.  And if that isn't enough, for thepiece de resistance, we'll cast Bruce Willis as the Clint Eastwood forthe 90s.  We need a name that tells the story, so LAST MAN STANDING itis.  Okay, now stand back and watch the dollars roll in.       By now, you are probably either thinking that this is one of thestupider ideas you have heard recently or that this could be a lot offun.  Well, the truth is that this highly atmospheric piece ofcinematic nonsense is fun albeit not that much.  Back in 1964,Eastwood's invulnerability was original enough to be hokeyentertainment.  Here watching Willis as outlaw John Smith gun downscores and scores of people before getting hit is so derivative thatthe film quickly bogs down.  Nevertheless, the show may be worthwatching for the atmosphere and the images.       The film starts with hired gun Smith riding into the Texas town ofJericho run by Sheriff Ed Galt (Bruce Dern).  There are two rivalChicago gangs - an Italian one run by Fredo Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) andan Irish one by Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) - that have run almosteveryone out of town.  When they aren't killing each other, the gangsearn a living shipping illegal booze from Mexico.  Smith is afreelancer who alternates sides and slowly kills off each gang.       The town looks just like the Western town in FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.There is even a dead horse in it to remind you of the linkage.  Thecinematography by Lloyd Ahern (WILD BILL) and the sets by Gary Wissner(SEVEN, THE ABYSS, and WYATT EARP) are certainly the best and mostimaginative parts of the film.  They paint a beautiful homage to theWestern towns in Eastwood's films.  The most effective atmosphere isthe blowing sand reducing visibility to about ten feet, but there arealso large rain storms and blinding rays of sun to enjoy.       Soon John Smith gets paid by one side and then the other to goguns blazing to wipe out a few more bad guys.  The costumes by DanMoore (WILD BILL) are all hats, suits, vests, big pistols, and Tommyguns.  In the many Tommy guns massacres, I kept looking for Bonnie andClyde to appear at any moment.       Hill's script is populated with terse dialog in pure Eastwoodstyle.  Doyle tells Smith, ""I figure you as the kind of guy that alwaysgoes to the highest bidder.""  Smith refuses his offer with, ""I may be agun for hire, but I'm not exactly an assassin.""  Got that distinctionpartner?       Actually, Doyle already has in his stable a shooter named Hickeyso evil that he slit his father's throat, and then when he was sent toan orphanage, he burned it down with all of the kids in it.  Thismeanest of the mean is played with subtle gusto by Christopher Walken.       Hill tries to make Smith into some kind of introspectivephilosopher, but this unbelievable silliness is laughable.  Doyle hasan imprisoned mistress named Felina (Karina Lombard star of WIDESARGASSO SEA) who confesses to Smith that, ""My fear is my curse.What's yours?""  He retorts, ""I was born with a conscious.""  Later whenhe goes out on a limb for someone and his killing prowess suffers, helaments, ""You can know the rules and still do the wrong thing.""       Still our philosopher killer is not perfect.  In one of hisaphorisms, he reflects that, ""I always like sinners a lot better thansaints.""  He also shares with us the tautology that, ""Everybody ends updead.  It's just a matter of when.""  This justifies his slaughter ofanother dozen guys.  By an hour into the picture the audience istotally anesthetized to death.  People with large holes and flowingblood become nothing more than targets in a video game.       In a completely predictable show, I thought there was going to bea mildly surprising ending.  Sad to say, it was not to be.  As soon asyou hear the plot, you can write the rest of the script yourself andsave your seven bucks.  Of course, if you do you will miss out on somegreat atmosphere. ",Last Man Standing,R,1996,2
523,"Fred Schepisi's delightfully sweet and dryly funny LAST ORDERS features acornucopia of great, older English actors, including Michael Caine, TomCourtenay, David Hemmings, Bob Hoskins, Helen Mirren and Ray Winstone.  Justwatching them work is well worth the price of admission, but the script, basedon Graham Swift's novel, is a real treat as well.  For almost two mesmerizinghours, we get to know the characters' lives, loves and friends as they reminiscealoud and as younger actors play them in flashbacks.  We come to love each andeveryone of them so much that the arrival of the ending credits is the film'sonly disappointment.  The purposely ambiguous title refers both to the last orders of the deceasednamed Jack (Caine) and to the calling for the last round of drinks at the pubwhere the guys hang out.  The story, which fluidly and clearly moves back andforth in time, begins just after Jack, a second-generation butcher, has beencremated.  The guys are gathering at the pub with ""Jack in a box,"" as his friendLenny (Hemmings) refers to the ashes.  The mission that day is to make an ashesscattering pilgrimage to Margate, a seaside resort town where Jack and Amy(Mirren) had their honeymoon.  Jack's son, Vince (Ray Winstone), a car salesman,drives them.  Also along for the ride is Jack's friend Vic (Tom Courtenay), anundertaker who delivers the funniest line.  ""My old dad,"" Vic tells them, ""usedto say, 'You don't dilly-dally with the deceased.'""  Their dalliance en route toMargate, however, is precisely what makes the movie so captivating.  Along theway, many memories are shared as well as a few secrets.  All are touching.  LAST ORDERS runs 1:39.  It is rated R for ""sexuality and some language"" andwould be acceptable for teenagers. ",Last Orders,R,2001,3.5
524,"THE LAST SAMURAI stars Hollywood's number one A-list actor Tom Cruise asCivil War veteran Captain Woodrow Algren, a washed-up American hero hauntedby nightmares of his participation in the Little Big Horn debacle.  Adrunkard who makes his living hawking firearms like a cheap carnival barker,he is offered several times his salary to go to Japan to teach modernwarfare to their soldiers. This hot-and-cold action picture, set in 1876, is directed by Edward Zwick,who can normally be counted on for fast paced dramas such as THE SIEGE andCOURAGE UNDER FIRE.  This time he starts the film cutely and dramaticallyand then lets it bog down in a long, pretentious middle section thatsometimes feels more like an endurance contest than a movie. After being captured by the rebels he is fighting, Algren comes to love andrespect his captors and learns how to fight as a samurai, without the use ofmodern weaponry.  The analogies to the training in the ways of the Jedi fromTHE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are obvious -- only the light saber and Yoda aremissing.  This snoozer of a middle is interrupted by a big Ninja fightsequence that is simply spectacular.  In fact, whenever the movie involvesfighting, it soars.  The battle armor is incredible, and the costumes andthe music are certain choices for Oscar nominations. After all of his training, including getting beaten repeatedly by sticks,and after having to utter some awkward and pretentious dialog (""I am besetby the ironies of my life.""), Algren and his previous enemy, Katsumoto (KenWatanabe), finally fight together in a battle royal that is truly awesome.This sequence is reminiscent of the large battle segment in GETTYSBURG.  THELAST SAMURAI isn't a bad film, but it could and should have been a greatone.  If you just wait and see it on video, you can easily edit out the manyslack moments. THE LAST SAMURAI runs way too long at 2:32.  The film is in Japanese withEnglish subtitles and in English.  It is rated R for ""strong violence andbattle sequences"" and would be acceptable for teenagers. My son Jeffrey, age 14, said that it was one of the best movies of the yearand gave it ****.  He was very touched by it and said that it was one of thefew movies that made him tear-up.  He loved the costumes, the music, theaction and the character development.  He found the film realistic, and heespecially liked the ending.","Last Samurai, The",R,2003,3
525,"""The Last Shot"" tells a fascinating true story, one originally writtenabout in a Details article by Steve Fishman, in which the FBI usedan aspiring filmmaker's screenplay as a front for a mob sting operation.The writer was led to believe his script, the one he had only dreamtof turning into a movie, was being fast-tracked by Hollywood intoproduction. He was wrong. A sad account, yes, for all those strugglingfilmmakers out there praying and hoping for a big break, but alsoa potential source for some ripe comedic material. Such is the casewith ""The Last Shot,"" the smooth directing debut of writer Jeff Nathanson(2002's ""Catch Me If You Can""), a brassy satire of moviemaking andall of the shortcuts taken and unforeseen pitfalls that work theirway into it. The picture is often hilarious, sometimes rudely so,and its eccentric ensemble of characters hold a forthright charm thatcarry them through the rougher third-act passages, when things turn pretty serious. In an unorthodox attempt to capture a head mob boss, FBI agent JoeDevine (Alec Baldwin) heads to Hollywood under the guise of a hot-shotproducer and hand-picks a screenplay called ""Arizona"" by lowly Grauman'sChinese Theater employee Steve Schats (Matthew Broderick) to turninto a respectably budgeted feature film. Steve, who had all but givenup his dreams of stardom, is all the more nonplussed to discover thathe will get to direct himself. Only, there isn't going to be a movieat all, and not Steve, not the crew, and not the actors, includingfading starlet Emily French (Toni Collette), have any ideas they aremere pawns in a bigger scheme to snare the mob. ""The Last Shot"" has a breezy tone and a wicked edge, good enough tomake for a satisfying 90 minutes but not quite madcap or tightly developedenough to be anything more. While Joe's goal of catching the mob isclearly defined, less conspicuous is how, exactly, the making of themovie is going to aid in his work. The film, which mostly depictsall of the pre-production work of Steve's unknowingly faux motionpicture, also neglects the countless uproarious possibilities thatmight have gone with a bunch of complete amateurs trying to make aHollywood feature. So, just as filming commences and the momentumbegins to build, the story is wrapped up and cuts things a little short. Nevertheless, there is some sharp, unanticipatedly brazen comic goldleading up to that paltry finale. In an uncredited two-scene cameo,the invaluable Joan Cusack (2003's ""The School of Rock"") is brilliantlyfunny as a brutally honest Hollywood exec who coaches Joe and hisfellow undercover co-workers on the ins and outs of the film business.Gags concerning a lonely dog who allegedly commits suicide, actressEmily French's overblown death-scene audition and ensuing desperationfor the lead role, and even the making of ""Jaws"" keep the laughs comingin the first hour at a fast clip. As for the very notion of forcingSteve to shoot the desert-set ""Arizona"" in the very New England-lookingRhode Island town of Providence, the sight of them trying to scoutlocations to stand in for the Colorado River and even the Grand Canyon is priceless. In his meatiest role since 1999's ""Election,"" Matthew Broderick isdelectably charming and wide-eyed as Steve Schats, who is so dumbstruckto be making a movie that he doesn't stop and realize none of it isreal. Broderick makes Steve innocently good-hearted and naive„butnot stupid„a believable portrait of a man technically unskilled inmaking movies but with a love for the cinema that could possibly transcendhis lack of experience. Alec Baldwin (2003's ""The Cooler"") makes asolid match for Broderick as Joe Devine, a veritable nice guy whogrows to regret his deceptions and fears having to tell Steve thetruth. Baldwin does nothing wrong here, and is superb at playing dead-pan,but there is something about his look that makes him not seem likean FBI agent. Actually, there are times when it is easy to forgetwho he is playing and uncontrollably think of him as being a partof the mob. It is no fault of his, probably having more to do withhow unexplicitly his character is written. As actress Emily French, once an Oscar-winner who turned to a shortstint in porn and is looking for a step back up to the A-list, ToniCollette (2004's ""Connie and Carla"") is fabulously droll with narya wink or a smile. Collette wonderfully plays into the general stereotypesof Hollywood actresses while somehow avoiding cliches; her Emily isso content and nonchalant within the realm of her own world that shedoesn't even realize how outlandish she really is. Finally, CalistaFlockhart (1999's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"") is intentionally insufferable,but insufferable all the same, as Steve's girlfriend, Valerie, ananimal-hating, borderline-psychotic wannabe actress. Flockhart relishesthe un-PC role, a big step away from ""Ally McBeal,"" but her characteris akin to fingernails on a blackboard. In its satirical look at making a big film in a small town, ""The LastShot"" resembles David Mamet's 2000 entry, ""State and Main,"" lackingMamet's pitch-perfect, world-class dialogue but probably a littlemore humorously clever in its ideas. There is a nagging sense, though,even as it entertains and concocts some slyly acidic, in-the-knowjokes, that it is holding back from being the encompassing Hollywoodmockery it intends to be. The premise should have been more tenaciouslydeveloped, rather than an excuse to attach jokes to, and the third-actround-up does slow things down. The final scene, however, is kindof mournful in a positive way, effectively bringing to a close thejourneys Steve and Joe have been on and showing the respect that hasgrown between them. Putting the film's overall quality in the termsof the money-hungry Hollywood mindset, ""The Last Shot"" is an amusing,likable sleeper hit, but not an out-of-the-stratosphere blockbuster. ","Last Shot, The",R,2004,3
526,"      LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS is a Henry Jaglom film.  He is thedirector, the editor, and to the extent there is a script, he wrote it.As in most of his movies, he also plays a role, albeit a small role inthis film.  Jaglom is arguably the most independent of film makers inAmerica today.  He makes his movies for himself and allows the audienceto view them much as your neighbor might invite you over for some homemovies.  He is frequently criticized for being self-indulgent, but tome that is his charm.       Although Jaglom films can be pretentious one moment and totallyoff the wall the next, they always push the edge of the envelope.  Myfavorite is ALWAYS (1985) which should not be confused with Spielberg'sALWAYS (1989) with Holly Hunter.  Jaglom's ALWAYS is apseudo-documentary about the signing of his divorce papers and has asubtitle of BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOREVER.  In ALWAYS he has a weekendparty and invites his soon to be ex over along with all of theirfriends.  It was one of my top ten movies of the 80s.       Jaglom does not mind experimenting which means some of his moviesare turkeys, but others are brilliant successes.  I found LAST SUMMERIN THE HAMPTONS to be a minimally enjoyable movie, but one that,nevertheless, has a certain fascination.  It starts with the strains of""Accentuate the Positive"".  This choice of this tune has a meaning youmay want to ponder during the slow parts of the film.  In typicalJaglom style the picture is shot (Hanania Baer) frequently with asingle handheld camera and too many pans and zooms that leave theaudience dizzy.       In LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS, Helena Mora (Viveca Lindfors) thematriarch of an artistic family invites everyone back for the lastsummer they will have in the family home in the Hamptons before it issold.  Helena is a great star who owns the large sprawling home.Although retired from acting herself, she teaches it to others.  Herfamily consists of her son-in-law, avant-garde director Ivan Axelrod(Andre Gregory), his daughter Trish (Melissa Leo) and his playwrightson Jake (Jon Robin Baitz), Helena's son Eli Garield (Ron Rifkin) andhis daughter Chlow (Martha Plimpton), and others.  To the estate theyhave invited the currently famous actress Oona Hart (Victoria Foyt).       The family is one who prides themselves in taking forever toproduce their artistic endeavors and not caring if they are financiallysuccessful.  Jake however informs the audience that ""the dirty littlesecret of the avant-garde is they are jealous of money.""  It is as ifJaglom is saying this himself.  As if he is saying, I only make theseart house pictures and although I claim not to care, I wish one wouldbecome a major hit that would make me filthy rich.       When Jaglom shows up in the movie, he plays Oona's agent Max.  Maxwants her to play a sequel to the mindless but popular movie she justfinished.  He claims that if she does this, she could start commandingtwo to three million dollars per picture.  She is angry because shefeels her life is being wasted and tells him forcefully, ""We could havedone something important Max.  We could have fought child abuse orRepublicans!""       Although Oona is successful, she keeps trying to improve hercraft.  She does this by acting as a baby seal, a leopard, and a heron.She has long scenes where she converses with people acting and talkinglike these animals.  A great but failed attempt by Jaglom atcreativity.  Poor Foyt really put herself out on a limb and tried hard,but ended up looking bizarre and totally ridiculous.  When he has AndreGregory (MY DINNER WITH ANDRE and VANYA ON 42ND STREET) act as aleopard wooing Foyt's leopard, you want to yell at the screen to getserious.       The best and only part of show that really works is the way itdeals with Trish and her incestuous relationship with her gay brotherJake.  None of the rest of the characters in this movie are the leastbit believable, but Jake and especially Trish are.  They have a seriousproblem to deal with and the movie handles the touchy subject of incesthonestly and amazingly well.  To further complicate things, Trishcomplains that Jake steals all of her boyfriends.       LAST SUMMER IN THE HAMPTONS runs overly long at 1:45.  It is ratedR for some bad language and for the incest themes.  It is a soft R andwould be fine for teenagers.  Although I can not recommend the movie,I'm glad I gave it a try.  Mining Jagloms can sometimes turn up gold,but then again, sometimes not.  For the risk taking and for theexcellent acting by Melissa Leo and Jon Robin Baitz, I give it * 1/2. ",Last Summer In the Hamptons,R,1996,1.5
527,"      THE LAST SUPPER is a no holds bared satire and political comedyabout the far left and the far right.  It manages to be both thoughtprovoking as well being chock full of dark humor.  The premise of theshow, as stated by Luke (Courtney Vance), concerns his theoretical timemachine.  ""It's 1909 and you're alone with a young artist named Adolph.Do you kill him?""  Think seriously about your answer to that questionbefore reading the rest of the review as it may color how you view theplausibility of the film's plot.       As the show starts five graduate students and self-proclaimedliberals, Jude (Cameron Diaz), Luke, Paulie (Annabeth Gish), Marc(Jonathan Penner), and Pete (Ron Eldard), who share a house in Iowa,are watching TV.  They are ridiculing the conservative politicalcommentator Norman Arbuthnot (Ron Perlman) who is a straight take offfrom Rush Limbaugh.  Norman warns his audience that, ""A storm isbrewing my friends, and someone must stop it.""       Into their lives comes a redneck ex-Marine named Zack (BillPaxton) who drives a pickup and who fought in Desert Storm.  Afterbefriending Marc by giving him a lift, the group invites Zack to stayfor supper.  He soon starts mouthing one racist cliche after another.Although the dinner table dialog by writer Dan Rosen, is too outlandishto be credible, taken as satire, it is great.  After he ridiculesliberals as talking but never taking action, he turns psychotic on themand threatens them with a knife.  Marc responds by stabbing in the backand killing him.       Paulie demands, ""We've got to call the police.  They'llunderstand.""  In a strong and beautifully controlled performance byCourtney Vance as Luke, he ridicules this idea with, ""Sure they would.Grad student kills war hero with a knife.  You'll probably just get aticket.""  Luke confidently wants to just bury him since, ""Peopledisappear all of the time.""  Jude retorts, ""Especially in Iowa.  Weprobably saved him from an alien abduction.""  The script is full ofthis intelligent and biting humor.       At first some of the group is horrified, but eventually theydecide the world is a better place with Zack dead.  Luke arguesrhetorically, ""What if you kill somebody whose death makes the world abetter place?""  Jude says ""The conservatives are effective.  They dothings.  All we do is buy animal-friendly mascara.""  From this streamof logic they devise a scheme whereby they have a dinner party once aweek and invite over a conservative.  If they view him as dangerous andthey can not chance his mind by the end of the meal, they will give himpoison wine out of the blue decanter rather than the good wine in thegreen.  They all figure this will be a success since as Paulie puts it,""Look we're liberals.  We do the right thing.""  Once this starts, theyfind almost everyone suspect and kill them.  When a guy shows up with aswastika, they announce happy hour and kill him before dinner evenstarts.       Although I am a card carrying conservative, I found the satirehilarious.  Okay, so I lied, I don't have a card, but I am a dedicatedconservative.  This is the type of movie that people on all ends of thepolitical spectrum should be able to enjoy, laugh at, and generallymake them think.       The first in their experiment is a homophobic priest namedReverend Gerald Hutchen played humbly, but bigotedly by CharlesDurning.  As soon as he asks to say grace, which they ridicule, theystart eyeing the blue bottle.  I soon lost track of everyone they foundobjectionable and killed.  These included a male chauvinist, ananti-ecologist (""I'm not anti-earth; I'm pro-earthling.  Kind of hardto care about the earth if you don't have a house to live in.""), alibrarian who banned ""Catcher in the Rye"", a militant Right-to-lifeactivist, a black Muslim, and an anti-homeless guy.  An innocent andsweet high school senior girl whose only crime was to sue the schooldistrict for distributing condoms does test the groups resolve to fightfor liberal causes with unswerving vigor.       Nora Dunn plays Sheriff Alice Stanley who gets suspicious of thegoings on at the house.  Finally, the central figure in the show turnsout to be none other than the Rush Limbaugh figure.  The ending of thefilm is imaginative as the rest of the script.       The editing by Luis Colina yields a film that moves quickly butnot so fast it fells like sound bites which would be an easy way tooveredit the film.  The cinematography by Paul Cameron is veryeffective in its use of the wide angle lens.  He shoots all of theliberals at one end of the table with it and then the conservative byhimself at the other end thus creating a perfect us versus themmetaphor.  The dramatic thunderstorms which bracket the shows beginningand ending are ominous and efficacious.       Although my favorite is Courtney Vance, all of the acting isbrilliant.  The conservatives with the exception of Bill Paxton and RonPerlman have one dimensional parts.  Nevertheless, all of theconservatives, although most have limited roles, are good too.  I thinkmost of the credit however should go to the director Stacy Title.  Anexceptional piece of work.       THE LAST SUPPER runs only 1:34.  It is rated R.  There is somesex, not overdone violence, pot smoking, a little bad language, but nonudity.  This show would be fine for any teenager.  With a strong cast,excellent direction and a funny script that never pulls its punches, Irecommend this show highly and give it *** 1/2. ","Last Supper, The",R,1996,3
528," THE LAWLESS HEART, jointly written and directed by Tom Hunsinger and NeilHunter, is a nice but frustrating film.  It's frustrating because it is so wellmade and acted but can never find much of anything to say.  With a largeensemble cast, the movie creates a host of characters worth caring about if theywere ever given something meatier to say or do.  The story starts at a party after the death of Stuart, a local restaurateur whodied in an unseen boating accident.  Stuart left behind a boyfriend, Nick (TomHollander), a sister, Judy (Ellie Haddington), and a dog.  Judy and her husband,Dan (Bill Nighy), are dairy farmers without much money.  They have to decidewhether to give Stuart's money to Nick or keep it for themselves.  Judy wants todo the right thing by giving it away, but Dan sees it as a matter of financialnecessity that they should keep it.  Like most of the story, however, no sooneris the issue of the money introduced than it is dropped, not to be heard ofagain until it is resolved in a spur of the moment decision in the end.  The rest of the story has Dan having a brief fling of infidelity, and Nicksampling and regretting a heterosexual assignation.  Just after the midwaypoint, the movie rewinds and tells the same story from the viewpoint of Tim(Douglas Henshall), a cousin of the deceased.  When the two stories are finallybrought together, the audience is left waiting for some narrative payoff thatnever occurs.  I liked all of the characters.  I'd really love to see them againif they could just locate a script worthy of them.  THE LAWLESS HEART runs 1:39.

Trent Burns, played with subtlepower by Sam Rockwell, doesn't live there, but he visits periodicallyto take care of those lush lawns and generally be abused by themansion's condescending owners.       ""The way I see it, you have people who own lawns and people whomow them,"" Trent says, explaining his role at the bottom of the socialhierarchy.  ""And they are never the same.""  Full of self-deprecatinghumor, Trent faces his reduced opportunities in life with spunk but notmuch hope.  He lives in a beat-up trailer parked illegally in a stateforest.       John Myhre's interior sets of the homes have cool, pale bluesaccented with perky roses and purples.  As the quirky film starts, itlooks like another plastic parody, but director John Duigan hassomething else entirely in mind.  The imaginative director of SIRENSstages scenes in ways shocking, surprising, and generally quitesatisfying.  With rampant sexuality, violent undertones, andfascinating characters, the film has something for everyone.       The central character in this modern fable is a precocious,10-year-old girl, Devon Stockard, played with wonderful complexity bynewcomer Mischa Barton.  She delivers a riveting performance thatconstantly surprises.  With her wide-eyes and broad smile, she isdevilishly delightful and ever inquisitive.  Although Devon seems asthough she might turn into a Lolita, she never does.  She is, however,a completely free spirit and a perfect match for her bosom buddy,Trent.       Devon's father is played by Christopher McDonald from last year'sLEAVE IT TO BEAVER and her mother by Academy Award nominee KathleenQuinlan from APOLLO 13.  Devon rebels against them.  In her mostpalpable protest, she sits on the top of her father's car and urinateson his car's windshield.       Devon's wildness comes out in other vivid ways.  She walks out ofher bedroom window one moonlit evening onto her rooftop.  Once there,she discards her gown, which is shown magically floating upward on awarm summer breeze.       Devon has a bad heart (hers goes ""dee dee dum, dee dee dum"" whenit should go ""dee dum, dee dum, dee dum"") and a propensity to see theworld in terms of a fairy tale that she keeps inventing.  (""Once upon atime in the middle of a dark forest, a boy lived aloneƒ"") The chemistrybetween Devon and Trent is a delight to behold and in moves in ways theaudience never quite suspects.       Kathleen Quinlan, whose specialty is loyal, suffering housewives,plays an erotically charged one this time.  Having a most unusualaffair with one of the local young men, she manages to transmit a rawsexuality solely through her facial expressions.  The director'stalents are best seen in those scenes in which he transforms weedpulling and salad preparation into incredibly erotic undertakings.       LAWN DOGS, like SIRENS, basically defies description.  Suffice itto say that it has just about everything in it, including a directorwho knows precisely how to combine the ingredients in amazing andcompelling ways.  The performance by young Mischa Barton alone is worththe price of admission.       LAWN DOGS runs 1:41.

530,"""Laws of Attraction,"" a romantic comedy about two ace divorce lawyers who fall in love as they represent opposing sides of a case, is nearly as tedious as it is unfunny. Reminiscent of a modern-day retelling of 1949's ""Adam's Rib,"" stars Julianne Moore (200 2's ""The Hours"") and Pierce Brosnan (2002's ""Die Another Day"") are more than capable as actors, but any hopes of their romance igniting the sparks of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are shattered right from the start. Moore and Brosnan have no palpable chemistry together, and under the incapable helm of director Peter Howitt (2003's ""Johnny English"") and screenwriters Aline Brosh McKenna (1999's ""Three to Tango"") and Robert Harling, they are asked to perform well below their obvious natural intelligence. Manhattan divorce attorneys Audrey Miller (Julianne Moore) and Daniel Rafferty (Pierce Brosnan) are at the top of their respective field, collectively never having lost a single case. When Daniel moves back to the east coast and meets Audrey, there is an attraction at first sight. Audrey, however, does not return the gesture. Going through divorces day in and day out has left her a hardened, cynical woman, uninterested in marriage or even having a relationship (""A trial-run marriage,"" as she describes it). Following a night of letting loose with a whole lot of drinks over a business dinner, Audrey is horrified to wake up in Daniel's bed. And when the two of them later decide to represent the divorce proceedings of fashion designer Serena (Parker Posey) and rock star Thorne Jamison (Michael Sheen) and, once again, end up together and married after a drunken night, Audrey can no longer deny that Daniel might be the right guy for her. ""Laws of Attraction"" is a trying slog through a formula romance that is exempt of energy and surprises. It is crystal-clear where the story is going every step of the way, which would have been acceptable had the characters of Audrey and Daniel seemed righ t for each other. They don't, and as much as Pierce Brosnan gazes at Moore with hearts in his eyes, he came off looking more like a leering perv. Meanwhile, Audrey outwardly holds so much disdain for Daniel throughout that her reversal of feelings in the third act creak with the machinations of a simple plot requirement needing to be filled. The characters simply are not a plausible match for each other, and no amount of loyal work from Moore and Brosnan can change this. If the romantic aspect of the story is lackluster, then its comedic intentions fail to an even greater degree. The one-liners, if you can call them that, are dreary and lame, and the pratfalls and crutches Audrey is given only act to dumb her down. She knocks files off desks, freaks out on a dime and makes a fool of herself, and, despite winning all of her cases and being confident in court, she secretly pigs out on junk food in bathroom stalls to nurture her anxiety. That's an awfully original character tra it (insert sarcasm). Based on what is glimpsed in the finished product, Audrey is unbelievable as a Yale graduate who finished at the top of her class. Meanwhile, director Peter Howitt proves that he does not know the first thing about courtroom behavior. Each and every court scene is awkwardly written, vague, and uninvolving, and because of this Daniel and Audrey are unable to show the viewer why they are regarded as such fine lawyers. Howitt makes the mistake too often of telling his audience information on the characters, rather than showing them, which makes the entire enterprise implausible. In a rare film role outside of the spy genre, Pierce Brosnan is at ease but unmemorable as the self-assured, smarmy Daniel Rafferty. As Audrey Miller, Julianne Moore is a more accomplished performer, and it is a testament to her abilities that she can be so very good even in the most fruitless of parts. Supporting the two leads, Frances Fisher (2003's ""House of Sand and Fog"") gets to be amiably brash and outspoken as Audrey's mother, Sara, but there is a missed opportunity here to explore this potentially interesting mother-daughter relationship. After all, there is something to be said for a beautiful woman to constantly feel overshadowed by her hip, glamorous, Botoxed mother. Finally, Parker Posey (2002's ""Personal Velocity"") and Michael Sheen (2003's ""Timeline"") are shrill and grungy as the feuding couple going through a vicious divorce. ""Laws of Attraction"" may mercifully clock in at only 90 minutes, but that is still about 90 too long. The time spent watching this hackneyed waste is interminable, frustrating, and quite boring. A shameful excuse for a star vehicle for Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan, ""Laws of At traction "" won't likely even stand as a footnote on either of their respective careers. Having only seen it myself just two hours ago, it has already begun to drift from my memory.",Laws of Attraction,PG-13,2004,2
531,"In Lerner and Loewe's musical ""My Fair Lady"" based on G.B.Shaw's Pygmalion, Professor Henry Higgins, a stickler forlinguistic style, reminds us, ""The French don't care what they do,actually; so long as they pronounce it properly.""    Prescientprofessor!  Not everyone in the world thinks like us Americans,nor do others speak like us as the French just now remind usby rejecting the term ""e-mail"" just as we superciliouslysuggested using the term ""freedom fries"" to refer to thosegreasy potatoes that really have nothing much to do with Franceanyway.     Cultural disparities are not only inconvenient to travelers butoften comical, a concept that James Ivory, inspired by DianeJohnson's novel, ""Le Divorce,"" milks for subtle humor, nuancedcriticism, and an absorbing (if overplotted) story.  The French,oppose not only what they consider America's so-called gung-ho cowboy spirit in foreign policy but as we learn in this filmwould quickly go along with Maggie Smith's observation in ""Teawith Mussolini"" while watching Yanks at a nearby table eating ahot fudge sundae, ""The Americans vulgarize everything.""  At therisk of being schematic, we note from ""Le Divorce"" that thestereotypical American does not see eye to eye with thestereotypical Frenchman in matters of sex, morality, food, andfashion though the differences are more subtle thanpronounced.     To illustrate the thesis within a charming plot featuringcharacters both charismatic and snooty, the Merchant Ivoryproduction goes with an ensemble exposition which, forconvenience sake, we can say centers on Isabel (Kate Hudson). To assist her pregnant sister, Roxy (Naomi Watts) who is livingas an expatriate in Paris with her daughter and her Frenchhusband, Charles-Henry (Melvil Poupaud). Her happiness isshattered suddenly when her man without much ado simplywalks out on her to pursue an affair and appears stunned thathis wife bears an American stubbornness: she does not want togive him a divorce.       For her part Isabel is not about to spend all her time with hersister but rather takes a job editing papers of an Americanauthor, Olivia Pace (Glenn Close),  has a fling with Olivia'syoung bohemian assistant (Romain Duris), eventually settlinginto the essentially European role of mistress to a much olderdiplomat, Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte).  Charles-Henry's motherand family matriarch, Mme. Suzanne de Persand (LeslieCaron), moves to settle the marital problems in a rational way,perturbed by the emotional turmoil expressed by Charles-Henry's soon-to-be-divorced wife, Roxy.     If that sounds complicated (especially for a fluffy comedy),there's a lot more going on, enough subplots to fill the screenwith two additional movies.  For example, there's considerableado about the ownership of a painting which Roxy took from herSanta Barbara home to Paris, a work which may or may not bean authentic by a French master.  The French have laid a claimon behalf of the Louvre while the estranged couple differ on howthe proceeds should be divided.  In addition, the parents of thetwo young women (Sam Waterston and Stockard Channing),together with the women's very American brother (ThomasLennon) have arrived in Paris following a half-hearted attemptby the emotional Roxy to commit suicide while out of the blue,an entertainment lawyer (Mathew Modine) is stalking his ownwife, furious that she is now carrying on an affair with Roxy'sestranged husband.  Got it now?       Somehow all the strands save one involving theentertainment lawyer are logically woven together in a film thatmay suggest a loosely plotted Robert Altman drama but whichretains Kate Hudson's character as its center.  While Americanshave been known to shack up with people other than theirspouses particularly if the significant other is rich the Frenchhave institutionalized the tradition of wealthy men who keepmistresses.  The women are given introductory gifts (in the caseof the Isabel-Edgar affair, an $18,000 red alligator bag) and thewomen are ultimately treated to expensive scarves such as theone that Edgar, shopping in an exclusive store, tries on theAmerican writer he runs into in an exclusive store, Olivia (whohappened to be an ex-mistress given the same treatment).       The ambiance a plush chateau owned by French matriarchMme. de Persand, an elegant restaurant serving a $900 lunch(a tab that upsets the American brother while treated likenothing extraordinary by the French), the auction gallery sellingthe painting owned by Roxy and her flighty husband Charles-Henry serves to punctuate the differences between the stylish,matter-of-fat French best illustrated by Leslie Caron as a FrenchMaggie Smith and the passionate Americans, best shown by thehysterical pleas of Naomi Watts.     While Kate Hudson's education in the culture of the Frenchstands out, Naomi Watts's powerful performance is the ne plusultra of the film.  As opposed to the calm exterior of the familymatriarch, Watts's face shows the fury and frustration of awoman who is facing life with a daughter and a baby on the wayin a country whose culture she no longer accepts.  Above all, wenever lose track of James Ivory's vision which is to trip the lightfantastic rather than indulge in melodramatic fanfare in a filmthat shows how good can ultimately come from separation anddivorce. ",Le Divorce,PG-13,2003,3
532,"In terms of this summer's large-scale, special effects-laden actionextravaganzas, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is lower-keyand less flashy. None of its big moments come close to approachingthe sheer adrenaline rush of, say, the highway sequence in ""The MatrixReloaded"" or the crane chase through the Hollywood street in ""Terminator3: Rise of the Machines"" or the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrikein ""X2."" And yet, the film is decidedly more involving than all ofthe above, holds more intriguingly original conceits, and--here'sa refreshing change of pace--keeps its running time well below the two-hour mark. Based on the comic book by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, ""The Leagueof Extraordinary Gentlemen"" brings together a wide array of figuresfrom classic literature to join forces and do battle against a megalomaniacout to start a World War between England and Germany. The time is1899, and a masked villain known as the Phantom has begun to destroyboth countries in an attempt to create a strife between them, and,thus, getting the chance to sell his new high-tech weaponry. To preventthis from happening, British secret agent ""M"" (Richard Roxburgh) enliststhe aid of aging adventurer Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery), sea-farerCaptain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), the Invisible Man (Tony Curran),and Dracula's ex-lover and newly vampiric Mina Harker (Peta Wilson).Given free reign to find anyone else who may want to join their new""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" Quartermain later finds helpin the form of the immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Dr. Jekylland Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng), and the now-adult Tom Sawyer (ShaneWest). As their quest leads them to Venice, across the open seas ina gigantic submarine known as the Nautilus, and finally to the snowymountains of Mongolia, it becomes increasingly apparent that one oftheir own may secretly be in cahoots with the Phantom. Directed with casual aplomb by Stephen Norrington (1998's ""Blade""),""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" captures your attention fromthe first frame, holds it for most of the running time, and does itwithout trying too hard. As far as this year's comic book adaptationsgo, the movie chimes in second only to the adult-minded and challenging""Hulk."" That said movie is superior to ""Daredevil,"" ""X2,"" and ""BulletproofMonk,"" as well as non-comic book features like ""The Matrix Reloaded,""""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" and yet is stillnothing more than merely good, only goes to prove that there is muchroom for improvement in today's summer blockbusters. First, the good. The premise itself, in which famous characters fromliterature cross paths and work together for the greater good, isexciting and ingenious. The Invisible Man, for example, is able tospy on the bad guys without ever being seen, while Dr. Jekyll occasionallytransforms into his giant, Hulkish alter-ego Mr. Hyde, and the bloodthirstyMina Harker can turn into a hundred bats at once and attack at will.The camaraderie between the lead characters is easy-going and believable,with a subtly forming father-son relationship between Allan Quartmain(who lost his own son years ago) and Tom Sawyer quietly effectivewithout growing maudlin. The production design (credited to CarolSpier) of a turn-of-the-century world that, nonetheless, has futuristicelements around the edges, is sometimes awe-inspiring and always sumptuous.The special effects are also some of the best of the year, with Mr.Hyde surprisingly more lifelike in his creation and movements thanthe Hulk himself. The Nautilus, an enormous, curvy, fast-moving submarine,is an equally superb visual treat. Although the picture moves with efficiency and the pacing rarely flags(makers of the overlong, overblown ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" takenote), the editing does not hold such close scrutiny. In one scene,the characters can be in England, and in the next they are in Venicewithout any reasoning. No matter how fast the Nautilus can move, itcertainly isn't superpowered to achieve such a feat as this. The movie'slacking sense of space and time is often confused because of it. Additionally,while the members of the ""League"" all get their chance to be in thespotlight, their backstories are woefully underdeveloped, and disappointinglylittle is taken advantage of from their respective novels. At 72, Sean Connery (1999's ""Entrapment"") appears to be in amazinglyfine shape and still passes muster as an action hero. With his distinctivevoice, speech, and suave mannerisms, Connery brings nobility and exuberanceto every role he plays, and Allan Quartermain is no exception. AsTom Sawyer (the one original addition to the film that wasn't in thecomic), Shane West (2002's ""A Walk to Remember"") does quite well inthe part of Quartermain's young apprentice. And Peta Wilson (TV's""La Femme Nikita"") has got Mina Harker down pat, with equal partssensuality, sweetness, and vicious bite. As problematic as certain elements are (the anticlimactic ending,too, could have used some more thought), ""The League of ExtraordinaryGentlemen"" is undeniable entertainment, far more compact and frequentlysatisfying than some of this summer's bigger--and lesser--action pictures.After seeing the promise that director Stephen Norrington has shownwith what is set up as a new potential franchise, the idea of a ""Leagueof Extraordinary Gentlemen 2"" doesn't sound like a bad idea at all.There are many more high-flying adventures that Allan Quartermain,The Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, and the rest of them could potentiallygo on, and there's also much that could be solidified and perfected on a second voyage.","League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The",PG-13,2003,1.5

The girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of Delta Nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says: ""If I'm going to be a Senator by the time I'm 30...I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn."" Determined to prove she's as smart a snobby brunette (Selma Blair) from country-club Connecticut, Elle not only applies to Harvard Law School but gets in, much to the amazement of family, friends and faculty. Once there, this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives, befriending a local manicurist (Jennifer Coolidge), dazzling a professor (Victor Garber) and rescuing a defendant (Ali Larter) in a celebrated Boston murder trial, plus finding a more worthy beau (Luke Wilson). In the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker John Hughes and his disciple Amy Heckerling, there's wit, cheerfulness, a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving.

534,"The small percentage of movie-goers who do the right thingand stay in their seats until the final credits roll may notice thedisclaimer: ""Monitored by the American Humane Society.  Noanimal was harmed during the production of this film.""  Thisregulation puts the U.S. in the minority of nations refusing toallow dogs, cats and other mammals displayed on the screen tosuffer in any way.  Yet when it comes to the use of four-leggedcreatures to test products, America is not yet there.  What manyin the audience of ""Legally Blonde 2: Red White & Blonde"" willrealize at the close of the thankfully brief film is that dogs, likebunnies, are used by science not simply to research for curesfor disease but for the trivial purpose of testing whether they willsuffer when covered with mascara or lipstick.  Kate Kondell,who wrote this sequel to ""Legally Blonde,"" has her heart in theright place, but as we know, the road to hell is paved with goodintentions.  While ""Legally Blonde 2"" isn't exactly cinematicHades, the broadly drawn characterizations, the virtuallycomplete absence of wit and nuance, and the message drivenhome that the only thing our sheep in Congress need is aheartfelt speech to make them join hands and vote unanimouslyfor apple pie and motherhood, is close enough.     The problem is not with Reese Witherspoon, whose capacityfor both comedic turns and dramatic flourishes was highlightedby Alexander Payne's entertaining yet spot-on satire, ""Election."" In that 1999 movie, filled with audacity and wickedness, aNebraska teacher tries to stymie the election of a compulsivelyambitious overachiever (played by Ms. Witherspoon), the lattergaining her revenge by exposing the instructor's extra-curricularsexual activities.  This time around, her character settles for thepredictable victory but in doing so, director Charles Herman-Wumfeld takes a step down in his career-making ""KissingJessica Stein,"" which was a bold and unpredictable turn aboutthe unexpected emotional consequences that befall a womanwho answers a personal ad.     ""Legally Blonde 2"" finds Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon),favoring pink and thereby standing out from the army oforganization-man politicians decked out in the more appropriatecolors of gray and black.  When Elle goes to Washington to fightfor a bill that would make illegal the use of animals to testcosmetics, she runs into several roadblocks.  CongresswomanVictoria Rudd (Sally Field), who is sponsoring the bill and whohas enlisted Elle to help her get it passed, betrays the youngand pert Ms. Woods.  The congresswoman's staff, headed bythe straight-laced  Grace (Regina King), are both repelled byElle's audacity and envious of her preliminary successes.    Herefforts to get the bill passed are blocked in turn by a no-nonsense member of the House, appropriately named LibbyHauser (Dana Ivey) and a conservative southerner, Stan (BruceMcGill).  True to the nature of the sitcom, all the protagonistneeds to do is to find the weaknesses in the opposition, exploitthem, and move on to the glorious, crowd-pleasing finale.     If this film is meant to show how venal our legislators are (byopposing bills that they like if their principal donors tocampaigns are opposed), it does so, but only superficially.  OnlyRip Van Winkle would lack the cynicism needed to explode themyths of fairness.  If the movie indicates that the common guy,in this case doorman Sid Post (played by Bob Newhart whoseyears have not cured his irritating, Hugh-Grant-like stutter),knows what's good for America, yes, of course.  If ""LegallyBlonde 2"" is designed as a believable fable, a Ms. Woods Goesto Washington, then, no nor is that important.  What issignificant is the absence of any but the broadest, most sit-comish jokes, the sort of movie that will appeal to an audiencethat roars when it finds out Elle Woods's Chihuahua, Bruiser(Moondoggie), is gay. ","Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde",PG-13,2003,2
535,"      LEGENDS OF THE FALL is a soap opera set on a ranch in Montana atthe turn of the century.  It goes from the age of cowboys and Indianswith everybody on horseback to World War I and beyond.  It is a largemovie painted on a vast canvas ultimately spanning almost a century.At the core of the piece is the story of a young man, played byheartthrob Brad Pitt, his family, friends, and lovers.       The movie starts with his dad (Anthony Hopkins) fighting forIndian rights by quitting the army in protest.  It then immediatelyswitches to an isolated ranch in some of the most beautiful Montanalandscape you have ever seen.  At the ranch are his two brothers (AidanQuinn and Henry Thomas) and an old, wise, trusted, and heavily clichedIndian friend (Gordon Tootoosis).  Eventually, there are two girlfriends(Julie Ormond and Karina Lombard) as well plus lots of other minorcharacters.       The biggest attraction for the movie is watching the visuals.  Thelandscape chosen was stunning.  The cinematography was perfect with 90%of the outdoor scenes carefully filmed in the last twenty minutes oftwilight and always with the actors' hair back-lit by the setting sun.The indoor scenes were dark with the glow of candles or with lightstreaming in from the outside.  Travelogues never looked better.  Iexpected to see someone selling land in Montana in the lobby after theshow!       Unless you are a big fan of seeing hearts cut out of the bodies ofanimals and people or unless you feel you must see all of Brad Pitt'smovies (he is major handsome), I can see no reason to see this filmother than as a long travelogue.       The biggest problem I had with the movie was the script (writtenby Susan Shilliday and Bill Wittliff) and to a lesser degree thedirecting (by Edward Zwick).  There are so many ridiculous andunbelievable things these characters do that I ran out of fingers andtoes counting them.  Totally unbelievable.  I did not care about any ofthem.       After forty-five minutes, I was looking at my watch hoping itwould get better (it actually got worse), and wondering when it wouldend.  Sad to say it ran for an incredibly long 2:13.  Perhaps they aregoing to make it into a TV mini-series which is what it looked likeanyway.  It is correctly rated R for heavy violence.  If your teenagerwants to see it, buy her a poster of Brad Pitt instead for her room andsuggest she pass on the movie.  I recommend this movie only to thoseinterested in relocating to Montana.  I award the movie * 1/2 andsuggest all of the proceeds of the show be paid directly to thecinematographer. ",Legends of the Fall,R,1995,1.5
536,"The author of this review didn't need advice of Wes Cravento build opinion about movie sequels. Together with remakes,now extremely popular among big studio executives, sequelsrepresent the embodiment of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy.I became aware of that almost decade and half ago, when theinevitable comparisons between sequels and original filmsbegan giving disappointing results. To make thing evenworse, bad quality of sequels even managed to change theinitial good impressions of originals. Such thing almosthappened to LETHAL WEAPON, one of the most successful moviefranchises in modern Hollywood. The slide of quality insequels wasn't that severe, but the change of character was.While the last film in the series represents one of thepurest examples of action comedy genre and ""high concept"",the 1987 original, directed by Richard Donner, was made asdeadly serious police film.  The plot, based on the screenplay by Shane Black, is set inLos Angeles during Christmas. Roger Murtaugh (played byDanny Glover) is black LAPD homicide detective who has justturned 50 and has every reason to be proud of his lifeachievements - perfect service record, nice family andsuburban home that is embodiment of American dream. MartinRiggs (played by Mel Gibson) is white LAPD narcoticsdetective who became expert in marksmanship and martial artswhile serving in Special Forces during Vietnam War; recentdeath of beloved wife, on the other hand, made himemotionally unstable and nearly suicidal so nobody wants towork with him. Murtaugh reluctantly becomes his partner andtwo policemen, who don't have anything in common exceptVietnam War record, starts investigating suicide ofhigh-class prostitute. The case stops being routine when itturns out that the prostitute happened to be daughter ofMichael Hunsaker (played by Tom Atkins), rich banker andMurtaugh's war buddy. Hunsaker hints that his daughter's wasactually murdered in order to stop him from spilling beansabout large and sinister conspiracy. His words are takenseriously when everyone connected with the case, includinghim, starts getting killed by expert assassins. Murtaugh andRiggs continue with the investigation that would lead themtowards ""Shadow Company"", group of former CIA agents andmercenaries led by General McAllister (played by MitchellRyan). In the meantime, Riggs himself becomes assassin'starget and Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (played by TraciWolfe) gets kidnapped.  First viewing of LETHAL WEAPON was more than pleasantsurprise to me. On the surface, the script contains enoughcliches to make this film indistinguishable from multitudeof 1980s action romps featuring Vietnam veterans and theirdeadly skills being used on hordes of evil drug dealers inthree-piece suits. But LETHAL WEAPON looks different from anaverage film of such kind, thanks to the very good directionby Richard Donner. This director never belonged to the majorleague of Hollywood filmmakers, but his reputation ofreliable craftsman is well deserved, since he alwayssucceeds in turning his mega-budgets into pleasant viewingexperiences. In case of LETHAL WEAPON, big budget becameevident in a series of elaborate and spectacular actionscenes (stuntman died during filming one of them). But thespectacle comes second to the well-created atmosphere of thefilm and Donner's clever use of sharp contrasts - Murtaugh'ssuburban idyll vs. Riggs' living in cheap trailer, glamorouslifestyle vs. corruption and depravity. But the sharpestcontrast is provided by combined forces of Eric Clapton andMichael Kamen whose musical score confronts spirit ofChristmas with atmosphere filled with loneliness, tragedyand death.  Actually, action scenes, no matter how spectacular they are,come second to the atmosphere of the film. But the mostmemorable things about LETHAL WEAPON are its two leadingcharacters. What differentiates remarkable action films fromsimple action films are the protagonists we care for, andShane Black did wonderful job in providing that by writingMurtaugh and Riggs. Actors playing them did even moreremarkable job. Danny Glover is simply excellent aspoliceman who embodies American middle-class ideals -successful career, material wealth, loving family - and hisinsistence on police procedure and reluctance to shoot firstand ask questions later - qualities usually associated withhero's monkey-wrenching superior in average police movies -become quite understandable. But Murtaugh hides skeletons inhis closet - his painful and (presumably violent) Vietnampast is well hidden from his family, and when his familybecomes endangered Murtaugh gets as irrational as Riggs. MelGibson, on the other hand, embraced Riggs as opportunity toplay character very different from the one that made himfamous in MAD MAX series. Unlike the deadly but cool RoadWarrior, Riggs is initially presented as ""damaged goods"" andhe stays that way until the last shot. We are glad that theperson with such skills is employed on the side of Good, butfew of us would like to be in his company. The scenes thatfeature Riggs' outbursts have intensity rarely matched inthe history of cinema. Both Glover and Gibson employ a lotof talent in order to slowly build tolerance and later thebond between those two almost irreconcilable personalities.All other actors were shadowed by such great performances,although some, like Traci Wolfe as Murtaugh's daughter withteenage crush on Riggs, underlines humanity of leadcharacters.  Unfortunately, the film loses its momentum in the secondhalf, when character exposition gives way for action and allcliches associated with it. In many ways, those actionsscenes, although well-done, are implausible (Murtaugh andRiggs, no matter how insane they are, would hardly go afterwhole army of vicious killers without back-up) or evenpredictable (dreadful final showdown between Riggs and chiefassassin played by Gary Busey). Some critics would frownupon the such first class characters being used in thirdgrade plot that deals with government agents going bad andusing covert ops for selfish and nefarious purposes -something that became action movie cliche by itself in late1980s. Such plots, inspired by Iran-Contra scandal and allconspiracy theories that followed it, could, unfortunately,be inspired by some world conflicts that are actual todayand where the line between political intrigue, militaryoperation and organised crime is always blurred (as thecareer of recently deceased Serb paramilitary leader Arkanclearly shows).  Despite being associated with uninspired sequels and clichedone-liner about old age and certain bodily function(actually borrowed by Friedkin's TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.shot two years earlier), LETHAL WEAPON remains one of thoserare 1980s action films that passed the test of time. ",Lethal Weapon,R,1987,3
537," All icing, no cake. That pretty much sums up ""Lethal Weapon 4."" Having decided that the appeal of the buddy cop franchise was action, jokes and the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, the powers that be apparently decided to discard such antiquated elements as character development and coherent plotting, opting instead to create a film of virtually nothing but action, jokes and the chemistry between Gibson and Glover. And so we have ""Lethal Weapon 4,"" a 127 minute stunt and shtick extravaganza.   In the stunt department, a car crashes into a building, drives through, crashes out the other side and continues pursuing the bad guys. Very cool. Mel's stunt double climbs from vehicle to vehicle during a high speed freeway chase. Jet Li moves quite adroitly while kicking the crap out of everybody. There's lots and lots of big explosions too, along with the series' trademark sadism.  Moving on to the shtick, Mel plays lots of wacky practical jokes on his partner and best friend Danny. He gets him to dance in his underwear to ""distract"" a lunatic. Later, he repeatedly fastens newspaper photos of Danny in his underwear to the cubicle walls in the police station. He tricks Danny into believing that Chris Rock is gay and infatuated with him. And so on.  In-between the jokes and fights, there's a couple of pregnancies thrown in, along with a nominal, extremely murky plot about Chinese people doing bad things. The film's recurring theme is family, which is nice.  It's all very fast-paced and pretty entertaining on its own terms, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the first ""Lethal Weapon."" I remembered the agony of that scene where Gibson, as the suicidal Martin Riggs, sat quivering with the barrel of a gun in his mouth, crying tears of frustration when he couldn't pull the trigger. I remembered Danny Glover, as quintessential family man Roger Murtaugh, nursing his partner through his anguish, displaying remarkable nobility and compassion. Sure, ""Lethal Weapon"" was often cheesy and lurid, but I cared about those men.  Watching the fourth installment of the series, I realized how much I missed Riggs and Murtaugh, back when they were people instead of the Two Stooges. Sure, I laughed at a lot of Gibson's puns and wisecracks, but missed the man behind the jokes. With Danny Glover, witnessing his sputtering straight man bit actually became embarrassing. At what point in the series was it decided that Murtaugh didn't need his dignity anymore?  As for the rest of the cast, aside from an absurd, but nifty fight scene, Rene Russo is relegated to the background, although she gets more screen time than the rest of the womenfolk. Joe Pesci returns as the extraordinarily irritating Leo Getz, punctuating his constant yammering with his ""Okay! Okay!"" catch phrase. As if that wasn't annoying enough, Chris Rock joins the proceedings with his own shrill brand of fingernails-on-the-blackboard verbal torture. The nadir of the film comes during a scene where Rock and Pesci exchange rapid fire banalities. I swear to God, if I'd had an Uzi at that moment I would have happily riddled the screen with bullets.  Thankfully, ""Lethal Weapon 4"" wraps up with a genuinely warm, family scrapbook scene that almost makes everything else forgivable. It's as if the cast was saying ""Folks, we're doing this for the last time. We know it's all ridiculous, but we're just having fun and we hope that you had some too."" And, to a certain extent, I did. But it's hard to watch talented performers throw plot, character development, logic and credibility away in favor of playing caricatures in a high-octane free-for-all. I guess I'm just getting too old for this shit. ",Lethal Weapon 4,R,1998,2

539,"      Life is short so time is precious.  From that axiom we derive afundamental rule of movie going: Don't waste your time at moviesstarring people whom you know you hate.       Well, as of two weeks ago, I knew that I could not stand HowardStern or Jim Carrey.  The former was merely foul mouthed and the latterwas an incorrigible overactor.  Since I knew this to be so, Istudiously avoided listening to or seeing them.  There were more thanenough alternatives so skipping their acts was a prudent and obviousdecision for me.       Last week I saw Howard Stern's PRIVATE PARTS and found it one ofthe funniest and sweetest films in a long time.  This week it was JimCarrey in LIAR LIAR, and again, a complete surprise.  One of my fellowcritics suggested I see LIAR LIAR and the trailers did look promising,but still this was Jim Carrey, whose last appearance was in THE CABLEGUY.       A second confession in as many weeks is in order for my readers.Although his incessant physical comedy can easily exhaust his audience,I thought Jim Carrey's performance was hilarious.  I hate slapstickbecause it usually dissolves into mindless stupidity, but Carreymanages to take this brand of humor to a new level.  Carrey has so muchskill and dexterity that he could breathe life into a bad comedy, whichLIAR LIAR is not.  The intelligent script by Paul Guay and StephenMazur utilizes Carrey's talent masterfully.  I expected his antics, butwas surprised by the quantity and effectiveness of the one linerepartee.       Director Tom Shadyac has the good sense to let Carrey set thepace.  In the not-to-be-missed outtakes during the ending credits, youcan see how Carrey was the star around which the other actors revolved.The film's cast has actors who can complement Carrey without everattempting to upstage him -- probably an insurmountable feat in anycase.       As LIAR LIAR opens, five-year-old Max Reid (Justin Cooper) isbusying explaining to his class what his father does.  Although Maxclaims his father's profession is being a liar, the teacher correctshim by saying Max must have meant lawyer.  The story demonstrates thatMax was right.  His dad, Fletcher (Jim Carrey), lies non-stop.  LikeMitch McDeere in THE FIRM, Fletcher is an insatiable workaholic, whowill do anything to advance his career.  Also like Howard Langston inJINGLE ALL THE WAY, Fletcher has trouble making the key events in son'slife.  Unlike these pervious films, however, where the familyrelationship was not credible, Fletcher is convincing about his lovefor his son.  The chemistry between them, especially in ""The Claw""routines, is genuine.  Divorced from his wife Audrey (Maura Tierney),Fletcher's part-time relationship with his son has just enough pathosto make the humor more involving.       Fletcher's busy schedule causes him to have to take Max with himone day to the office.  ""Why don't you go play in the office a minute,""Fletcher tells him.  ""Sue someone for everything they've got.""       The film takes the time to setup the long running big joke.  Alongthe way we meet Virginia Cole (Jennifer Tilly).  She is a connivingadulteress who wears skimpy clothes that advertise her wares.  In atelling bit of dialog, Fletcher interviews Virginia in his office toshow her what a hotshot lawyer he is.       ""Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that after you've providedyears of faithful service and loving support raising his children --,""says Fletcher.  ""They are his?""  ""Oh yeah,"" she replies.  ""One for sure.""       ""After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair andequitable share of the marital assets based on one single act ofindiscretion,"" explains Fletcher showing how he will frame her case.       ""Seven,"" corrects Virginia.  ""Seven single acts of indiscretion.""       Shrugging Fletcher says, ""Whatever.""       Max does not approve of his father's lying so he makes a singlewish as he blows out his birthday candles, ""I wish, for just one day,Dad couldn't tell a lie.""  Like the simple premise in GROUNDHOG DAYfrom this one fantasy element springs the charm of the rest of thestory.       Feeling compelled to tell the absolute truth can get a person inmore trouble than you would imagine.  Fletcher meets a woman in theelevator who says it is her first day on the job, and she is surprisedthat men have gone out of their way to be nice to her.  Fletcher takesone look at her bulging breasts and low cut dress and tells her why themen have been so obsequious to her.  She belts him one.       Max informs him that, ""My teacher tells me beauty is on theinside.""  Correcting him, Fletcher says, ""That's just something uglypeople say.""       The heart of the show is Virginia's divorce trial.  Beside being asometimes touching and always sidesplittingly funny film, the moviebecomes something of a mystery as well as you try to figure out how thetrial will end.  Suffice it to say that the ending is as imaginative asthe rest of this delightful picture.       LIAR LIAR runs a fast hour and a half.  It is rated PG-13 forsexual humor and language.  This is a mild PG-13.  If your kids are oldenough to know about sex, they will probably love the film since it isjust as likely to amuse a ten-year-old as a fifty-year-old.  A goodspirited film that had me doubling over in laughter.  I give it astrong recommendation and *** 1/2. ",Liar Liar,PG,1997,2.5
540," Like several of Eddie Murphy's past films (1998's ""Holy Man""), ""Life"" is a perfect example of a film with an identity crisis. Let Murphy loose and he can be a dynamite comic (1996's ""The Nutty Professor""), but too often he is mired in an uncomfortable mixture of comedy and drama. If Murphy wants to be treated seriously, why not make a straightforward dramatic piece, instead of intermingling it with juvenile comedy, and vice versa?  Spanning 60-odd years and beginning in the Prohibition era of 1932, Murphy stars as smooth con man Ray Gibson who, along with straight-laced banker Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence), finds himself owing a large debt to a bootlegger (Rick James). Paired together to travel from their home of Manhattan to the deep south of Mississippi on a bootlegging journey, they unwittingly witness the death of a black man caused by racism, and then are accused of the murder, sentenced to the Mississippi State Penitentiary for life. As the decades fly by and they remain locked up, Claude and Ray's friendship survives many different hurdles as they begin to suspect that they are going to die without ever being free again.  Does this sound like a rousing yuk-fest? I think not, and although ""Life"" does boast a few humorous moments (I liked, for example, an early scene where they enter into a ""No Coloreds"" restaurant and the waitress tells them that they only have ""whites-only pie""), the overall story is more depressing than anything else, since we know what we are basically watching is two innocent mens' lives being wasted away. In something like 1994's ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" this idea worked because the subject matter was treated with a realism and intelligence. In ""Life,"" it is mostly an excuse to give us one-liners heavily laced with the F-word (and worse).  ""Life"" also has severe pacing problems, as it often has a tendency to be marginally entertaining one minute, and then brain-numbingly dull and misguided the next. This major problem probably owes itself to the fact that there is no story arc to the film, nor is there much of a ""story"" to begin with. Sure, we follow Claude and Ray through an epic 60 years, but not much really happens in those years, and, at one point, a whole 28 years passes by within a two-minute montage! The only good thing about that is I knew the sooner Murphy and Lawrence began to get their faces more heavily applied with ""old man"" make up, the sooner it would be over.  Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence are strong presences throughout, and have at least fairly substantial material to work with. Murphy, especially, rolls things off his tongue at such a rapid rate that it is usually very humorous, and apparent that fellow comic actor Chris Tucker is only imitating him. Lawrence, meanwhile, portrays the more touching of the two characters as he is most affected by the prison experience and sees many of his future plans ultimately shot down, including his love relationship with a fetching young woman (Lisa Nicole Carson). Come to think of it, maybe the movie should have simply been retitled ""Eddie and Martin,"" as written right above the ""Life"" title on the poster. The movie focuses so much on the two that the rest of the many characters are either sorely underused or come off as mere afterthoughts.  Aside from the two central actors, also making an impression is the music score by Wyclef Jean, making his film scoring debut. It is clear that Jean worked very hard on the music to make it effective and put in precisely the right place, and it admittedly does work.   By the time the ending arrived in ""Life,"" without giving too much away, Claude and Ray are ninety-years-old, and although everything concludes on an upbeat note, it's a little difficult to pass by the reality that these two characters are going to be dead soon. Sure, they've hung on to each other's friendship, but that's not enough for me to walk out of the theater singing a happy tune. Honestly, not only did the film turn out to be a downer for me, but as I write this a mere eighty minutes after seeing it, much of the film has already exited my long-term-memory. After the disasterous ""Dr. Dolittle,"" the well-meaning misfire, ""Holy Man,"" and the mediocre, forgettable ""Life,"" perhaps Murphy should begin to choose his feature film projects a little more wisely. After all, as this movie can certainly attest to, life is short. ",Life,R,1999,2
541," 'A Life Less Ordinary' is such a quirky film with jabs of satirical themesthat I could have sworn I was watching a film by the Coen brothers.  In fact,this movie is the latest from 'Trainspotting' director Danny Boyle.  Thatfilm's writer, John Hodge, is responsible for the screenplay here as well. To describe 'A Life Less Ordinary' is to put a puzzled look on your face asyou say, ""Yeah, that's really what it's about"".  Heaven is the setting for some of the film's opening scenes where St. Gabriel(Dan Hedaya) is about to give a mission to two less than squeaky clean angels(Delroy Lindo and Holly Hunter) who have to return to Earth and cause twopeople to fall in love if they want to get back into Heaven and stay.    Ewan McGregor ('Trainspotting') plays a janitor who works in a building ownedby a tyrannical businessman (Ian Holm) and loses his job when the bossreplaces all the cleaning staff with robots!  Yes, little robots who bleep,turn and perform their duties accordingly.  Needless to say, this causesMcGregor so much anger and grief that he storms into the boss' office anddemands his job back.  His timing is somewhat awkward.  It comes just as Holmis telling his daughter (Cameron Diaz) that she will learn responsiblity bygoing to work at the company and will stop living off of her trust fund.  Shetakes pity on McGregor who ends up being swarmed by security guards insidethe office and he takes her hostage and the two of them eventually takerefuge in a broken down shack in the heart of the countryside.  All along,the two angels (Lindo and Hunter) are watching them and try to set up ascenario where McGregor and Diaz will fall in love.  If you have to wonderwhether or not they DO fall in love, then shame on you.    I immediately started getting flashbacks of 1994's 'The Chase' with CharlieSheen and Kristy Swanson as Sheen played an armed robber who holds up aconvenience store and when the police intercept him, he takes a little richgirl (Swanson) hostage.  Ditto here!  'A Life Less Ordinary' is nothing morethan a hostage movie where the romance is implausible and unconvincing.  Ittries to entertain lightly but comes off as a silly and innocuous with noreal reason to exist except to tell a story which has very little originalityand even less edge.    Relax.  Ewan McGregor will be featured as a young Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi in thenext 'Star Wars' trilogy but Cameron Diaz's act is starting to wear thin asshe tries to act seriously and when she displays anger in films, she reallymakes me laugh.  'A Life Less Ordinary' demonstrates one thing.  While the","Life Less Ordinary, A",R,1997,1
542,"""Life as a House,"" directed by Irwin Winkler (1999's ""At First Sight""), is an intimate family drama that gets a lot of mileage out of some very fine performances before making way for mawkishness in the final half-hour. Its premise plays out like a disease-of-the-week tearjerker (much like Christine Lahti's ""My First Mister"" did), and it's obvious that it got some inspiration from 1999's ""American Beauty,"" but the writing for the ensemble of characters is strong enough in the first 90 minutes to rise above the cliches. When George (Kevin Kline) is fired from his 25-year job at an architecture firm, only to discover soon after that he has an unalterable form of cancer, he decides to tear down his ramshackle home along the California shore to make way for the architectural triumph he has been putting off for so many years. With the construction of this house, George is determined to finally achieve one of his life goals, as well as use it as a means of finally forming a relationship with his angry, Goth-punk, 16-year-old son, Sam (Hayden Christensen). So, for the summer, George takes Sam off the hands of his unhappily remarried ex-wife who may still love him, Robin (Kristin Scott Thomas), and attempts to not only forge a close father-son bond, but also help him get clean from the drugs and self-destructive behavior that has run his life since the age of 12. There are many things to celebrate in ""Life as a House,"" particularly the impressively formed cast that sharply plays their roles with earnest conviction, but also quite a few missteps along the way. The screenplay, by Mark Andrus (1997's ""As Good as it Gets""), excels in its dialogue and character rapport, but the similarities between this and ""American Beauty"" are often too close to be simply incidental, right down to the two dysfunctional families living next door to each other, the supporting appearances of Sam Robards and Scott Bakula, and the closing narration by the lead male actor. Because it draws comparison, ""Life as a House"" does not even come close to reaching the synthetic realism of ""American Beauty,"" nor does it hold the same ultimate impact. The 30-minute homestretch also weakens the effectiveness of the picture, as a whole. Because this is a movie about a dying man, all of the predictable, melodramatic stock sequences are on hand, and yet it never deeply touched me in any way. The drastic turnaround of Sam, who goes from being a multi-pierced hustler in order to feed his drug habit, to a presentable, good-mannered young man, also occurs far too easily and quickly to be plausible.  What is intriguing about ""Life as a House,"" then, is the subtle handling of the familial relationships. George and Robin, who have been divorced for many years, still share a reciprocal love that proves to be heartbreaking for Robin, since she is now stuck in a dead-end marriage with a distant workaholic named Peter (Jamey Sheridan). Kevin Kline (2001's ""The Anniversary Party"") and Kristin Scott Thomas (1999's ""Random Hearts"") give lovely, impassioned performances, and they wonderfully play off of one another.  Hayden Christensen (2000's ""The Virgin Suicides"" and soon to be seen as Anakin Skywalker in ""Star Wars: Episode II"") is a startling standout who appears against type as the troubled Sam. In a last-ditch effort to win over Sam, who claims to hate him, George is adamant to get to know his son--first as his friend, and then as his father. Sam and George's relationship is one that most anyone who has ever had a child or a parent can relate to and understand. In well-rounded, smaller parts, Jena Malone (2001's ""Donnie Darko"") is sweet-natured and gleefully free-spirited as Alyssa, a classmate of Sam's who lives next to George. As Alyssa's mother, Coleen, it is awfully nice to see Mary Steenburgen (who hasn't been in a major feature film since 1995's ""Nixon"") again, and at the top of her game. Coleen is a loving single mother who finds herself starting an affair with Sam's teenage friend, Josh (Ian Somerhalder), and the alternate confusion and spontaneous joy that she feels about doing this is nicely played by Steenburgen. With a whimsical, catchy music score by Mark Isham (2001's ""Don't Say a Word""), ""Life as a House"" is a low-key drama worth seeing--when you've got the time--for its exemplary actors and their truthful, entertaining by-play with one another. What is disappointing is director Irwin Winkler's decision in the final act to both tug at the viewers' heartstrings and send them on their way with an artificial happy ending. There is enough that is good about ""Life as a House"" to make it a film worth recommending, but not quite enough to fully differentiate it from something that might air on cable's Lifetime network.",Life as a House,R,2001,3
543,"How do you feel about the death penalty for those convicted ofmurder?  Are you in favor because the Bible says ""An eye for aneye,"" or because you believe potential killers will be deterred orbecause you think the families of the victims would gain closure? Are you against the death penalty because you believe the stateshould not lower itself to the level of murderers, or because youthink innocent people may die or because you believe life withoutparole is a more effective punishment?  None of the above?  In anycase, though Charles Randolph, who scripted ""The Life of DavidGale,"" makes his position known over and over, hammering hisviews into the minds of the audience at every which turn, youprobably would not be offended by the film if you were pro-deathpenalty.  Why so?  Two words: Kevin Spacey among the mostexciting actors of our time.  But he is not the only plus for London-born Alan Parker's latest effort.  Parker, whose early career as anad executive may well have influenced the ways he made surethat all of us watching the big screen would know Randolph'sposition on the death penalty, converts what could have beenmerely a diatribe into a dramatic work.  ""Gale"" is glitzy, yes, butcarrying a final twist that could knock your socks off.  You won'tsee it coming unless some creep throws you a spoiler when youcouldn't turn your eyes away from a tell-all review on the 'net.     Parker, whose ""Mississippi Burning"" recreates the civil rightsstruggle of the 1960's, is right at home in this politically liberalfilm, making points against then Governor George W. Bush bycasting a sound-alike (Michael Crabtree) as the doctrinaire right-wing leader of Texas, the state with the most executions in itshistory and with some four hundred people on death row astestament to the idea that they sure as heck had not beendeterred.     Kevin Spacey is cast in the title role as a professor so brillianthe just might have come from an advanced civilization like K-Pax. Delivering a lecture to a hundred or so students, none of whomwould dream of looking at their watches, he discusses the waythat fantasies are great until they are realized: that bit of irony justmight have something to do with the movie's conclusion.  Framedfor the rape of a college student who ""would do anything to passthis course,"" he is eased out of his position on campus and islater charged with the rape-murder of Constance Harraway (LauraLinney), a fellow member of an organization fighting the deathpenalty.  Is he guilty?  Three courts seem to think so and so doescrackerjack journalist Bitsey Bloom (who must have had fathernamed Irving and a mother called Heather), until...until...  Togetherwith a newspaper intern, Zack Stemmons (comically played byGabriel Mann), she like her counterpart Clint Eastwood in ""TrueCrime"" is going to prove his innocence with minutes to go beforethe needle goes in, of course.     There are some actions that challenge credibility, such as thedelivery of half a million dollars in cash by a newspaper in returnfor the granting of an interview with the condemned man.  Wewonder why Zach is trusted with a metal attache case containingthe cash rather than with a certified check.  But that's within theconventions of a thriller, even one that has a political axe to grind.There is also a flaw in the debate that Gale has with GovernorHardin, in which the state's chief executive appears to stump thedeath penalty opponent before the TV camera with a point thatGale should have seen coming.  Laura Linney is the onlyperformer who can match Spacey in her performance as avigorous death penalty opponent, and though Kate Winslet is noslouch, Spacey can do no wrong.  The eyes of Texas may not likethe message or at least 66% of those fry-'em-up eyes but evenour president might be entertained by a picture whose 130minutes go by in a breeze. ","Life of David Gale, The",PG-13,2003,3
544," With ""sex, lies & videotape,""""Out of Sight"" and now ""TheLimey,"" film-maker Steven Soderberg has become the master of thelighter, gentler film noir. Charismatic Terence Stamp (who should havereceived an Oscar for ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"") stars as atough Englishman named Wilson who flies from London to Los Angeles tofind out who was really responsible for the death of his daughterJenny. With the help of Luiz Guzman, who had sent him a clipping aboutthe car crash ""accident"" which took her life, he tracks down a sleek,sleazy pop music producer, played by Peter Fonda, who had been Jenny'slover. He learns even more about what happened from Lesley Ann Warren,Jenny's acting teacher, and finds himself emeshed in Fonda'sdrug-running operation. Determined to savor his revenge, theCockney-speaking ex-con fantasizes about drawing a gun and shootingFonda on the spot but decides to torture the cowardly culprit a bitbefore killing him. Besides, first he has to eliminate Fonda'ssmirking chief of security, Barry Newman, and his hired goons. StevenSoderberg's stylish use of recurring flashbacks and memories iscompelling. It's as if you're seeing the story unfold through Stamp'sclear blue eyes. Curiously, both Stamp and Fonda seem to be doingparodies of their '60s screen personas, and the amazingly ""youthful""shots of Stamp were adroitly lifted from Ken Loach's ""Poor Cow"" (1967)in which Stamp also played a character named Wilson.

545,"In today's technologically advanced world, where Palm Pilots and Blackberry'shave only come to be widely acknowledged and used in recent yearsand the Internet is at virtually everyone's fingertips, it is mucheasier to dig up otherwise secretive information about anybody you'reinterested in learning about. This notion is at the forefront of ""LittleBlack Book,"" directed by Nick Hurran, a comedy-drama that is innocuousfor its first hour until it switches gears into cloying meanspiritednessjust in time for its all-wrong climax. That the final scenes are handledwith equal parts gentle truthfulness and feel-good charm is appreciated,but this positive reversal comes too late to undo the damage that has already been done. Stacy Holt (Brittany Murphy) is a bright, still-wet-behind-the-earsdreamer who is delighted when she is hired to become an associateproducer for a New Jersey-based, exploitative ""Jerry Springer""-inspireddaytime talk show hosted by Kippie Kann (Kathy Bates). Her promisinggig at the show coincides with boyfriend Derek (Ron Livingston) leavingtown on business. Having found out Derek was once in a relationshipwith a former guest on the show, bulimic model Lulu Fritz (Josie Maran),Stacy is uncontrollably curious to find out about her cagey boyfriend'spast loves. With the help of savvy co-worker Barb (Holly Hunter) andthe information he has stored on his Palm Pilot, Stacy goes againsther better judgment to track down Derek's ex-girlfriends and, by usingthe talk show as a ruse, interview them. Soon she is in way over herhead, discovering sympathy in her heart for these women, particularlyfriendly chef Joyce Adams (Julianne Nicholson), and realizing thatmessing with their private lives can only end badly. There may be something insightful to say about the relationship topicson display here, but ""Little Black Book,"" unfortunately, is not thatfilm. It also attempts to make a statement about the potentially dangerousmanipulation behind reality television, but confuses perception withsheer cruelty. Before the picture does this, however, in a third-actcenterpiece that is woefully hateful and unnecessary, ""Little BlackBook"" is mostly just uninteresting fluff. As a playful comedy, thelaughs are, by and large, stale, sexually-laced throwaways. And asa romance, there is none. For a film centering on a young woman'ssnooping to find out about a boyfriend she supposedly loves, the relationshipbetween Stacy and Derek plays like a weightless afterthought. Thereis no connection between the two in their too-few scenes together,and so the entire premise lacks urgency and a rooting interest. Simplyput, it never seems like anything is at stake for Stacy in regardto her romance with Derek. When the finale arrives, exposing some characters to have a differentagenda than expected and exploiting the mistakes Stacy has made, thelight tone is drained out and replaced by something surprisingly uglyand, in a nutshell, evil. This may be the moralistic point behindElisa Bell (2004's ""Sleepover"") and Melissa Carter's screenplay, butthe very immorality they use in serving it up for viewers is unforgivableand trite. The same things, concerning the fragility of relationships,the importance of honesty, and the detestable, shark-infested worldof reality talk shows, could have been attained without making a charadeof the characters and their feelings. When the tone changes yet againtoward maudlin sermonizing, director Nick Hurran goes overboard ina heedless aim to make what has just come before easier to swallow. As the ambitious, inquisitive Stacy Holt, Brittany Murphy (2003's""Uptown Girls"") gives it her best shot in making the proceedings palatable.Murphy again proves she has what it takes to be a leading lady„sheis fresh, quirky, and shrewd in always bypassing the predictable routeto go for something more interesting in her performances. She alsokeeps Stacy a likable person even when she is doing the wrong things,a difficult task that Murphy pulls off. Save for Julianne Nicholson(1999's ""The Love Letter""), quite good as the kindly ex Stacy befriendseven as she betrays her, the rest of the actors are not treated fairly.Holly Hunter (2003's ""Thirteen"") has the thankless ""best friend"" partuntil her true colors shine through in the climax, Kathy Bates (2002's""About Schmidt"") is wasted as talk show host Kippie Kann, and RonLivingston (2003's ""The Cooler"") is given the short thrift as the one-dimensional Derek. The closing of ""Little Black Book"" makes a valiant effort in savingthe movie as a whole. It is especially refreshing that the end doesnot hinge on who Stacy ends up with, but on what she has learned andhow she is going to press on in her life as a wiser person. And thevery last scene, unlikely as it is, is delightfully cute and clever,making you want to like the movie more than it deserves. The not-so-subtleallusions to 1988's far superior ""Working Girl""„it is one of Stacy'sfavorite movies and she is in love with the music of Carly Simon (whocontributes practically the entire soundtrack)„also work effectivelyto underscore Stacy's rollercoaster journey. If there is a reason to see ""Little Black Book,"" it is for the effortlesslyenchanting Brittany Murphy, but that isn't quite reason enough. Themajority of the picture is too misguided and dreary„and yes, needlesslyimpertinent„to wade through to get to the good stuff. This is one""Little Black Book"" that should have remained closed. ",Little Black Book,PG-13,2004,1.5
546,"      I went with low expectations to see LITTLE BUDDHA but was quitepleasantly surprised.  LITTLE BUDDHA is a fairy tale interwoven with acartoon like telling of the Buddha story.  The fairy tale is that agreat Buddhist teacher from Bhutan who died nine years ago may or maynot have been reincarnated into a nine year old boy who lives inSeattle.  He is given a cartoon picture book of the story of Buddha,and we have periodic long flash backs to the life of Buddha played muchlike a cartoon but starring Keanu Reeves as Prince Siddhartha who laterbecame known as Buddha.       Like most fairy tales, or operas for that matter, you must be ableto suspend disbelieve if you are to proceed.  Think about it.  Ifsomeone comes to your doorstep claiming to be a Buddhist monk and sayshe wants you to leave your young son at the local temple forexamination since your son might have been reincarnated, would you a)slam the door, b) call the police, or c) leave your little boy at thetemple?  In the movie, they eventually pick c.       This is a beautiful film written and directed by BernardoBertolucci who did THE LAST EMPEROR.  It was easy to forget logic andgo with the story.  I am familiar with Western Judeo-Christian beliefsbut knew nothing of Buddha or any of the legend surrounding his life.I found that part fascinating.  I do not know what liberties Bertoluccitook with the Buddha story, but I found it pretty bizarre besides beingfascinating, but then again, any religious story probably soundsstrange to someone who knows nothing about that religion.       Bridget Fonda (most recently excellent in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE)plays the mother and Chris Isaak (small part in Silence of the Lambs)plays the father of the nine year old (Alex Wiesendanger - a newactor).  Bridget Fonda's acting ranges from good to excellent.  She isgood here.  Isaak gives a blah performance.  The little boy is okay.  Ithink Keanu Reeves (e.g., in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING -  like his actingabilities) is a terrible actor.  This movie confirmed my opinion.  Itis the monks (led by Ruocheng Ying) and the story itself that make thismovie come alive.       The imaginative script is by Bernardo Bertolucci, Mark Peploe, andRudy Wurlitzer.  It shows the monks as real people who joke, fallasleep accidentally, and have to be reminded to take their medicine yethave almost a mystic quality about them nevertheless. ",Little Buddha,PG,1994,2.5
547,"""The Little Foxes"" was nominated for nine Academy Awards,including Best Picture, Best Director (William Wyler), Best Screenplay (Lillian Hellman), Best Editing, plus Best Actress for Bette Davis.  It didn't win a single award.  ""The Little Foxes"" takes place in the deep Southaround 1900.  Regina (Bette Davis), her oily brother Ben(Charles Dingle), and her greedy brother Oscarare partners in a plan to build a factory thatwill exploit the area's poor menial workers.Ben and Oscar have their share, but Regina mustconvince her sick husband Horace (Herbert Marshall)to put up her share.  But Horace disapproves of both theproject and his wife.  There is a subplot involving Davis' daughter Alexandra(Theresa Wright, in her film debut).  Oscar wants her to marry his good-for-nothing son Leo (Dan Duryea) while sheprefers the clever newspaper writer David Hewitt.  There are many good things to say about this film.The cinematography, the sets, the costumes, and thecast are all excellent.  But, there are problems.  The most obvious is thefilm's racism.  Blacks are shown performing all themenial labor.  They are portrayed as docile and obligingwith the minds of children.  Most of the film's protaganists aren't very likable,either.  Davis' character is even more rude and selfishthan usual, while Ben is grasping and Oscar is brutal.Poor Dan Duryea is again cast as a creep.  All lack any sense of morality.  Wright's character is sugar-sweetdespite living with her insulting mother, while herboyfriend has no accent, and seems a more energeticclone of her father.  The film's good-versus-evil theme is overplayed as well.  In one scene I disliked, Leo makes an insulting remark to David, who slaps him several times.  Leo finally lungeshalf-heartedly at David, who punches Leo, knocking himto the ground.  The audience is supposed to cheer fordefender-of-virtue David, but ends up wondering why Leois such a poor fighter.  Another silly scene has the dying Horace trying to makeit up the stairs to his medicine bottle.  He stumbles,rises, grabs the banister, etc.  He does everything butknock the bookcase over and tear down some curtains. ",Little Foxes,PG,1941,2.5
548,"One of the surest ways for the Hollywood actors to win the""Oscars"" is playing the characters burdened with someterrible affliction. On the other hand, serious dramaticmovies about the opposite - talented people - are quiterare. LITTLE MAN TATE, 1991 directorial debut by JodieFoster is one of such films.  The movie deals with Fred Tate (played by Adam Hann-Byrd),eight-year old child prodigy who is blessed with high IQ andmany talents, like mathematics, music and painting. For hissingle mother and cocktail waitress Dede (Jodie Foster),Fred is normal child that is supposed to have normalchildhood like everybody else. But, his intelligence hasestranged him from the peers in school, and, finally, itbrings attention of Dr. Jane Grierson (Diane Wiest),psychologist specialised for gifted children. She wants Fredto join her summer camp for gifted children. Dedereluctantly agrees, but soon the tension would erupt betweenher and Dr. Grierson, who wants Fred to have specialeducation, away from his mother.  In many ways, LITTLE MAN TATE has a lot of autobiographicelements for Jodie Foster. She, same as the protagonist inthe movie, was a child prodigy, becoming a huge film star atthe age of twelve. But, unlike many other child stars, shewas intelligent enough to know that stardom doesn't lastforever and she temporarily left Hollywood in order tofinish proper education. Her return later led to thetriumph, with two ""Oscars"" for THE ACCUSED and SILENCE OFTHE LAMBS. Enjoying the great respect as one of the mostmature stars in Hollywood, her directorial debut wasuniversally praised by the critics. Perhaps, they wentoverboard with praises - film is good, but it is basicallytelevision drama material, with rather simplistic plot thatdeals with the struggle between the heart (childhood) andmind (adulthood). Scott Frank's script takes the side ofheart, often portraying the intelligent children asobnoxious (""Math Magician"", brilliantly played by P.J.Ochlan) or their mentors as emotional cripples who lack theability to enjoy the life. The acting, on the other hand issuperb - Jodie Foster has a rather low key performance,overshadowed by young Adam Hann-Byrd and always reliableDianne Wiest. Many of the actors in short, but effectivescenes, manage to overcome the limitations of the weakscript. Foster as director, on the other hand, is quitecapable to make this film entertaining and touching despiteits flaws. In its time, Foster was praised for her debut.Now she should be praised even more, because GOOD WILLHUNTING, more recent and more acclaimed film dealing withthe same subject, really pales compared with LITTLE MANTATE. ",Little Man Tate,PG,1991,2
549,"Perhaps ""Battlefield Earth"" wasn't the worst movie of theyear! This offensive comedy raises that distinct possibility. AdamSandler (""Big Daddy"") runs amok as the silly third son of Satan(Harvey Keitel) who is sent to New York City in search of his tworotten brothers (Rhys Ifans, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister Jr.) who aredetermined to corrupt enough souls to pull a devil of a coup. Hisguide is Beefy, a talking bulldog. And a dorky design student(Patricia Arquette) provides a whiff of romance. The gleefullyirreverent screenplay by Tim Herlihy and Sandler rides roughshod overreligion, race, politics, sexual orientation, plus drug and alcoholabuse, offering much to offend everyone. Shortly into the film, itbecomes obvious that Popeye's Chicken has bankrolled the budget sincethere's more of this fast-food product placement than I've seen in anyrecent film. Except for Reese Witherspoon as a Valley-girl angel, thecameos (Dana Carvey, Rodney Dangerfield, Jon Lovitz, Regis Philbin)are crass and crude, particularly Quentin Tarantino's feeble attemptat acting. When his holy man dies in a pillar of fire, it'smerciful. Sandler's so-called speech impediment, caused by a blow froma shovel, has the annoying, irritating quality of nails scratching ona blackboard. But director Steven Brill and lenser Theo Van De Sande'sHieronymous Bosch-like depiction of Hell is fascinating, as iswatching Harvey Keitel tackle his first comedic role, particularlywhen he disintegrates into talking lips. It takes a certain amount ofdemented creativity to depict Hitler, dressed as a ballerina, beingtortured with a pineapple in a very dark, private portion of hisbody. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Little Nicky"" is a trulystupid, cosmically embarrassing 1. To call it moronic is unkind tomorons. ",Little Nicky,PG-13,2000,2
550,"      A LITTLE PRINCESS is at least the third film version of the bookof the same name by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  Shirley Temple was in the 1939 version.  You may have seen the last film version of one of Burnett's books a couple of years ago - the delightful THE SECRET GARDEN.  She also wrote LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY and other kids classics.       A LITTLE PRINCESS tells a magical, tragic, and dark and forebodingtale.  Sara Crewe, played by first time movie actress Liesel Matthews, is a girl of I guess about the age of 10.  She lives a wonderful life in India.  She spends her days creating delightful stories of a princess and an Indian god.  Her idyllic life is shattered when her father (Liam Cunningham) must go off to World War I.       Her father takes her to New York to stay in a marvelous privateroom at the best boarding school for young girls he can find.  It is run by the evil Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron from last year's BLACK BEAUTY).  She exudes charm to the parents so she can siphon off their money.  Her pupils are treated like prisoners, and she provides them with a mediocre education while probably skimming off large profits for herself.       Sara with her story telling ability and her inherent likableness,is an instant hit with almost all of the schoolgirls.  Among her many friends is Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester) who is the only girl servant at the school and the only black.  Sara's life soon takes a dramatic turn for the worse and that sets up the drama in the movie as well as the completely predictable ending.       There is much to admire in this children's movie.  The acting ispretty good.  Liesel Matthews gives a straight forward and simple rendition of Sara.  She never tries to manipulate your emotions; she just smiles a lot and delivers her lines.  I am not sure if she has much talent or not, but she is sweet.  Vanessa Lee Chester was given a small part and her acting consisted mainly of a lot nice smiling.       The best performance in the movie is that of the actress playingthe villain, Eleanor Bron - an easy person to hate.  Liam Cunningham gives a lifeless performance as the father.  I wished the director (Alfonso Cuaron) had kicked him in the pants a few times to get a little more energy out of him or even better had cast someone stronger. The Indian manservant who almost never spoke and whose name I did not catch was extremely effective.  Powerful eyes.       The real reason to see the show is for the magic of the images.The set decoration by Robert W. Welch gave us golden leaves for the hopeful scenes and gray snow for the sad.  The street scenes of New York were wonderful and reminiscent of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE.  The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, who should have won an Academy Award for LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, was worthy of Renoir.  The radiant colors in the story within a story set in India were incredible.  The best scene in the show had to be the one where the white snow burst into Sara's room like swirling white confetti and she danced in it in slow motion.       What was wrong with the show, other than the actors being too lowkey and relying too much on smiles to carry the day, was the script by Elizabeth Chandler and Richard LaGravenese.  For some reason, they felt obliged to add overly dark, sinister, and scary parts to a movie that had a fine evil villain already in Eleanor Bron.       A movie that gets and flaunts his G rating needs not to be onethat can so easily and so needlessly scare small children.  Even Jeffrey, my 6 year old, got scared by it.  Be warned, therefore, than this is truly a PG show regardless of the advertising and of the official MPAA rating of G.       Let me give a few examples.  First, why do you have people dyingin war with bombs bursting everywhere in a G show?  Why have scene after scene of realistic battle carnage?  Why have a frightening monster with numerous heads that lash out biting at the screen as if they are about to eat every kid in the theater?  Finally, why must we have a realistic scene of a child about to die in a horrible accident? If all of these plot devices are necessary, make them less explicit, insist on getting a PG rating and warn parents.  I recently saw a harmless show, THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL, BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN, which got a PG rating for a couple of damns - which most kids hear everyday.  Very few children have ever seen real battle carnage. End of diatribe.  The movie IS good nevertheless.       A LITTLE PRINCESS runs a well edited (Steve Weisberg) 1:40.  Myson gave it a thumb sideways.  He hated the war scene he said, and although he claimed to have liked parts of the show, he was unable, when pressed, to name a single one.  I suspect kids 8 and older may like the movie more, and I suspect girls may be more fond of it than boys.  I enjoyed the picture and am awarding it ** 1/2. I recommend it to you with the above caveats about the violence. ","Little Princess, A",G,1995,2.5
551," To an aristocratic Scotland of large estates and big castles, 8-year-old Tony Thompson and his family have come on temporary assignment from San Diego.  Tony's parents are the types who tell the Scots to speak English when they have trouble understanding them.  While there, Tony befriends and bonds with a little vampire, Rudolph (Rollo Weeks), about his own age -- for the past 300 years.  Jonathan Lipnicki, charming in STUART LITTLE but cloying in JERRY MAGUIRE, is relatively benign this time as Tony.  With spiked hair full of gel, nerdy glasses and a frozen expression, he does nothing to enliven Ulrich Edel's THE LITTLE VAMPIRE, which is as dead as a vampire with a stake through its heart.  One supposes that the movie is meant to be taken as a comedy, but it is a low-key and lifeless one with its best scenes generating only a small grin.  It does, however, give a new meaning to the old expression, ""I could eat a cow.""  Nothing in this flat film is worth outright laughs.    With its cheap special effects and unattractive, bleak cinematography, the movie isn't much fun to watch either.  It's an unimaginative, low-budget feature that you would expect to be released as a direct-to-TV movie on a kids' cable network.  In a blend of the crazy exterminator from MOUSE HUNT and the maniacal snowplow man from SNOW DAY, Rookery (Jim Carter) comes to kill off a local ""infestation of vampires.""  Dressed like a bum and acting like a madman, Rookery carries a glowing cross made out of florescent tubes to control the vampires.  Of course, Tony will be threatened but will end up saving the day.  Parents need to be warned about this film whose trailers look innocent and which comes with just a PG rating.  It has significant potential to frighten younger viewers.  Among many troublesome scenes is one in which Tony emerges with a bloody mouth and face as if he has been sucking blood from someone's neck.  Later we briefly see a ketchup bottle sitting on a table, but kids will have long since been scared and probably won't notice the bottle anyway.  Another has Tony apparently buried alive in a casket with rats.  And overall the movie is filled with dark images and spooky atmospherics.  The childish story doesn't have much to recommend it to those over 12.  Those under 9 could end up with some major nightmares.  The 9 to 12-year-olds, however, are the perfect demographics for this lame production.  They deserve much better, but if you've got kids in this limited age group, they'll probably like it.  My son did.  THE LITTLE VAMPIRE runs 1:37.  It is officially rated PG for ""some mild peril,"" but remember my warning.  It would be acceptable for most kids over 8.  My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the picture ****.  He said that he liked the way the movie had a strong but simple plot and that Rudolph was his favorite character.  His only complaint was that he didn't like the ending scene and that the PG rating was too mild.  He wanted a new ""PG-8"" rating for it. ",Little Vampire,PG,2000,1.5

553,"Based on the popular, just-cancelled Disney channel series, ""LizzieMcGuire,"" which I have been an unlikely fan of for several months(at 21, I am about ten years past the target demographic), ""The LizzieMcGuire Movie"" acts as a sort of farewell capper to the show and characters.While transferring the series' lightweight humor and tone, the filmmakes the grave mistake of turning the proceedings into what couldbest be described as a far-fetched fantasy. The result is somethingmore dissatisfying and lazily written than expected. For anyone who has watched the show already knows, Lizzie McGuire(Hilary Duff) is a normal, sweet-natured 14-year-old whose accident-proneways leave her hanging just outside her school's popularity stratospherewith best friends Gordo (Adam Lamberg) and Miranda (LaLaine, mysteriouslyabsent from the picture and off on a trip to Mexico). As celebrationfor graduating middle school, Lizzie bids her parents (Hallie Todd,Robert Carradine) and mischievous younger brother, Matt (Jake Thomas),farewell, and sets off with Gordo and the rest of her classmates fora two-week trip to Rome. Lizzie and Gordo are determined to experiencea few adventures along the way, but Gordo finds himself on the sidelines,having to cover for Lizzie when she meets Italian pop star Paolo (YaniGellman), who claims she is a dead ringer for singing partner Isabella.It seems they are contracted to perform together at an upcoming concertat the Coliseum, but with Isabella missing in action, he needs someoneto stand in for her. Despite being horrified of public appearances,Lizzie reluctantly agrees, immediately finding herself the centerof attention even as she must play the part of someone else--a taskshe realizes isn't the right thing to do. Directed by Jim Fall, whose debut was the 1999 gay romantic comedy,""Trick,"" ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" is as light as a feather and asinsignificant as whipped cream, threatening to evaporate even as itcontinues to play itself out. For a while, it works, thanks in nosmall part to 15-year-old star-in-the-making Hilary Duff (2003's ""AgentCody Banks""), who is thoroughly delightful and identifiable as thebubbly Lizzie McGuire. Duff commands the screen without even trying,her 1000-watt smile able to brighten even the dimmest of scenes. Italso turns out she has quite a good singing voice, performing twocatchy pop songs, ""What Dreams Are Made Of"" and ""Why Not,"" the formerone acting as the centerpiece for the concert climax. On entertainment value alone, ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" works betterthan the recent Amanda Bynes comedy, ""What a Girl Wants,"" if onlybecause it moves at a quicker pace and is fifteen minutes shorter.It doesn't take too long, however, to come to the disheartening realizationthat screenwriters Susan Estelle Jansen, Ed Decter, and John J. Strausshave done a slight disservice to the show from which it is based.The dialogue is less witty by a half, and the show's mostly reality-basedstorylines have been traded in for a bogus daydream fantasy aboutcelebrity treatment, lip-synching, and unexplained dopplegangers.With every other scene dedicated to music montages (an act of desperationto pad any movie's running time out), someone should have realizedbefore they fast-tracked this screenplay into production that it waslacking most of what makes the series so darn endearing and fresh. Aside from the lovely Duff, Alex Borstein (2002's ""Showtime"")--a formercast member of ""MadTV,"" best known for her character of Ms. Swan--isvery funny as the trip's controlling, egomaniacal chaperone/tour guideMiss Ungermeyer. Adam Lamberg is winning as Lizzie's curly-hairedbest bud, Gordo, who secretly hopes their friendship could be morethan a platonic one. And Jake Thomas (2001's ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"")is appropriately bratty and cute as Lizzie's little brother, Matt.As her supportive parents, Hallie Todd and Robert Carradine (2001's""Max Keeble's Big Move"") aren't around long enough to develop theircharacters much more beyond what has already been played out on the small screen. ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" is undemanding entertainment, somethingthat will delight young girls even as it sends a misguided and unbelievablemessage about what it takes to be happy and feel like you belong.The ending is also too rushed to be satisfying, heading into the endcredits before it has gotten around to concluding some of the subplotsand characters. As much as I like Hilary Duff and ""Lizzie McGuire,""they both deserved better than this underwhelming big screen outing.  ","Lizzie Mcguire Movie, The",PG,2003,2.5
554,"In Spring of 1982 the biggest television event in formerYugoslavia was the series of five science fiction filmsbeing premiered on Belgrade state television. Among themfour were MGM classics made in late 1960s and 1970s - 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY, LOGAN'S RUN, WESTWORLD, DEMON SEED (fifthwas relatively obscure Croatian 1976 period horrorIZBAVITELJ). Those four films left strong and lastingimpression on the author of this review, reaffirming hislove of science fiction and helping him to shape his tastein the movies, and also learning him to distinguish goodfrom bad examples of the genre. The impact was evenstronger, thanks to the fact that many of those films werere-aired shortly afterwards, as part of daytime educationalprogram (and uncut, which should give you rather insightfullook into the censorship standards of former Yugoslavia). Onthe other hand, although all those four films happened to begreat, there was only one that found special place in myheart. It was LOGAN'S RUN, 1976 science fiction spectacle byMichael Anderson.  The plot of the film is based on the 1967 novel by WilliamF. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson. It begins in the year2274, in a world depopulated by industrial pollution wherethe survivors live in the huge city under the dome. Thislast remaining piece of civilisation is actually a niceplace to live - advanced machines, controlled by omni-potentComputer, fulfil all existential needs, leaving inhabitantsto spend all their lives enjoying technological luxury, freesex, hallucinogenic drugs and other exotic forms ofentertainment. However, due to the population limit, allcitizens must end their life at the age of thirty, beingsubjected to spectacular quasi- religious ritual of Carouselthat offers vague hope of ""renewal"". Those who try to escapeCarousel and live past their thirtieth birthday are known asRunners, and their capture and immediate execution is a jobfor the police force known as Sandmen. Logan 5 (played byMichael York) is a Sandman who is given a special task byComputer - he must locate mythical place that sheltersRunners, known as Sanctuary, and destroy it. Logan, in orderto achieve that task, must pretend to be a Runner and thusinfiltrate the underground network of people who helpRunners in their escape. Logan gets in touch with beautifulJessica 6 (played by Jenny Agutter), one of the members ofthat group, and slowly builds her trust. She leads him toSanctuary and Logan along the way falls in love with her,begins questioning his own life as a Sandman and decides tobecome Runner for real. But, Computer has sent anotherSandman, his former best friend and colleague Francis 7(played by Richard Jordan) who would hunt two of them evenif it means going outside allegedly impenetrable citylimits.  LOGAN'S RUN is often referred as the best example of ascience fiction movie that didn't age very well. This ismost evident in the area of special effects. In 1976 MGMspent huge sums of money for the special effects that werestate-of-the-art for its time and actually won an ""Oscar"".But, only a year later, STAR WARS would set much higherstandards and make LOGAN'S RUN look cheap and laughable. Webecome aware of film's age in the beginning, when theaudience, which is introduced to the futuristic city byspectacular panoramas, actually sees rather patheticminiature models. Such impression is somewhat improved laterin the film, especially in the scenes featuring WashingtonD.C. of the distant future.  But the problems for LOGAN'S RUN aren't limited to theobsolete visual effects. Characters are sometimes givenlines that seem unrealistic, directed more towards theaudience than to each other. Music by usually reliable JerryGoldsmith is of variable quality -after the effectiveopening theme that combines classical orchestration andelectronic instruments, he goes to more standard territory.And Anderson as director uses that music on the wrongscenes. The acting is, to put it mildly, bellow standardsyou might expect in science fiction classics. Michael Yorkis not the best casting choice for the protagonist, lookingsomewhat too intellectual for tough, macho hero offuturistic action drama. His partner Jenny Agutter hasrather thankless role of classic damsel in distress, and sheis better remembered for her good looks and skimpy clothes(and lack of in couple of moments, brief but well-remembered by male science fiction fans in their earlyteens). However, even her thankless role is well played, atleast compared with terrible acting by Farrah Fawcett inepisodic role that became legend of its own. Late RichardJordan, on the other hand, is excellent as Logan'sfriend-turned-nemesis, bringing raw, masculine humanity tohis character, including some homoerotic overtones. Histotal opposite is equally superb Peter Ustinov who givesdignified portrayal of half-senile, almost childlike OldMan.  But all that flaws, that turned LOGAN'S RUN into ""that filmthat didn't age well"", ""that 1970s schlock"" and MST fodder,are not so important for the overall impression of the film.At least when we consider how different this film is fromscience fiction cinema of today. Now we expect sciencefiction films to feature CGI graphics, cool soundtracks andspectacular action, which makes plot and characters lessimportant. But in 1976, before Lucas and Spielberg begantheir infantilisation of American cinema industry, Hollywoodscience fiction was built on different principles.Interesting ideas, plots and characters were more importantthan cool special effects. LOGAN'S RUN was made on thoseprinciples, as a film that allowed viewers to use theirheads, as well as their senses, making them think long afterthe end credits.  LOGAN'S RUN, like any good, thought-provoking vision of thefuture, is actually built on some trends in the present. Theauthors of original novel, written in 1967 (mediocreaccording to most on-line critics, and, the author of thisreview, after reading the sequel, tends to believe them),were inspired by social turmoil of late 1960s andcounter-culture of younger generations, violently opposedtowards establishment of the older generations. They sawthis revolt as a consequence of unprecedented economicprosperity and technological advances, making youngergenerations, now unaffected by hardships of the past, lessmotivated to take responsibility for their lives as theirparents had done. In the future, role of parents (andwelfare state) is taken by omnipotent technology and thetables are turned - the younger generations now belong toestablishment; hedonism and instant self- gratification issupreme social value and those who preach family, work andresponsibility are considered dangerous subversives. Adecade later, young rebels of 1960s grew older, worldeconomy was hit by fuel crisis, but hedonism was stillreigning supreme and the vision of the future in LOGAN'S RUNwas still very believable. And the idea of mandatory agelimits was not so alien to the generations that grew onslogans like ""Don't trust anyone over thirty"".  This vision of future is, of course, hardly utopian. Scriptby David Zelag Goodman, same as the novel, sees the bravenew world of LOGAN'S RUN as dehumanised, totalitarian andsterile. Material wealth of this new world is by definitionlimited, and so are the boundaries of space, as well ofcreativity. Despite filmmakers' efforts to make the world asexotic as 1970s America, we could still see monochromaticfashion, so typical for typical totalitarian, oppressivedystopias of classical science fiction. And the humanity inthis world, same as in classical story THE MACHINE STOPS byE.M. Forster, is so accustomed to supertechnology that itbecomes doomed when this supertechnology begins failing (asit happens in this film). What is more disturbing is thefact that we might see seeds of this dystopia in our lives -recently Y2K phenomenon was supposed to cause effectssimilar to the ones seen in the last scenes of the film.  Perhaps some viewers wouldn't like the alternative to thisdystopia, which offer conservative worldview. Hedonism andinstant self-gratification ultimately lead to moral andphysical decay, as well as life without obligations, whichin the end becomes empty and pointless. Instead, peopleshould return to the ideals of glorious past (symbolised inWashington D.C.) and re-embrace family, work andresponsibility. Those who follow such path, like the hero ofthis film, would be rewarded with valuable experience ofpast generations and thus get ability to beat corrupt,decadent system. Taking this into account, the ending of thefilm, often referred, as unbelievable embodiment of bad SFstereotypes, actually becomes quite effective. The film endson positive note - although the powerful finale still leavesone important question unanswered. Would society as a wholebe as successful as Logan and manage to survive itstransformation from bunch of decadent pleasure- seekers intoresponsible human beings?  Whether LOGAN'S RUN happens to be conservative reaction onthe excesses of 1960s and 1970s or not, might be debatable.But it still remains very interesting and entertaining pieceof classic science fiction cinema. ",Logan's Run,NR,1976,3
555," Adrian Lyne's previous films (9 And 1/2 Weeks, FatalAttraction, etc) have dealt with the nature of sexual attraction andobsession, and his adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial 1958novel Lolita further explores these themes.  However, free of thestrict moral and censorship code that shaped Stanley Kubrick's 1962version, Lyne is able to explore the novel in far more detail.  WhereKubrick largely alluded to the nature of the relationship betweenHumbert and his precocious 12 year old step daughter, Lyne is able toexplore it in franker terms.  However, Lyne's intelligent and sensitive handling of theprovocative material and his sense of restraint is unexpected.  Lolitais nowhere near as sexually explicit or torrid as its detractors wouldhave us believe, but is rather a more poignant and evocative tale of atragically doomed and illicit love affair.  Many writers, includingJames Drearden, Harold Pinter, and even David Mamet, have attempted towrite a more contemporary flavoured adaptation of Lolita, but Lynefound the perfect collaborator in former Vanity Fair film criticStephen Schiff, whose lyrical and melancholy script seems to capturemuch of the book's flavour.  The two central performances are powerful and complex andenhance the movie.  Jeremy Irons brings his usual pained and hauntedexpression to the character of Humbert Humbert, the refined Englishprofessor who comes to New England to take up a teaching assignment in1947.  Humbert is still marked by the loss of an adolescent love thathas haunted him for the past quarter of a century.  He is initiallyreluctant to take up lodging with the man hungry widow Charlotte Haze(Melanie Griffith), until he spies her beautiful young daughterDolores (newcomer Dominique Swain).  Despite her childish demeanour, Dolores arouses long forgottenfeelings in Humbert.  He eventually marries Charlotte, just so he canbe close to Dolores, and successfully manages to avoid most of hishusbandly duties.  For a long time Charlotte misreads the attractionbetween Humbert and her daughter.  Following the death of Charlotte,Humbert and Dolores set out on a journey across an America slowlyrecovering from the war and emerging with a recognition of its ownidentity and culture.  Irons brings sophistication and urbane charm to the role, andmakes Humbert something of a sympathetic figure.  He convincinglyconveys Humbert's ever increasing sense of guilt and remorse.  Hisvoice over narration provides insight into his obsession, and alsoadds some touches of droll humour.  Lyne uses some neat cinematictricks to illustrate Humbert's disquieting inner nightmares as hebegins to lose control of the relationship.  Irons gives a confidentand convincing performance in this tricky role, whereas James Masonalways seemed uncomfortable.  In a remarkably assured debut performance, Swain (who went onto play Nicolas Cage's daughter in the action thriller Face/Off) is awonderfully seductive and manipulative nymphet.  Swain beautifullymixes childlike innocence with an earthy quality and a smoulderingsexuality that sears across the screen.  Frank Langella (from Dave, etc) is truly creepy as theenigmatic and predatory Quilty.  In the early stages, he is mainlyseen in shadows and gloomy lighting, which gives him a sinister,mysterious and somehow menacing quality.  Lyne's adaptation of Lolita finally reaches our screens,following a year of protracted debate over whether it is pornographyor art, and whether it should be banned.  Not since Martin Scorsese'sThe Last Temptation Of Christ has a film had so much freepre-publicity, which certainly won't harm it at the box office.  Farfrom glorifying paedophilia, as most of the film's detractors haveclaimed, Lolita ends badly and tragically for all concerned.  In fact,the most disturbing scene is the Taxi Driver-like violence at the endwhen Humbert confronts the monstrously amoral Quilty in his ownmansion.  The film is visually rich, and has a beautiful, glossy, almostromantic surface that seduces the audience, despite its dubioussubject matter.  Howard Atherton's exquisite cinematography brings tolife the rich American landscapes through which Humbert and Lolitatravel on their odyssey.  Ennio Morricone's lush score furtherenriches the movie. ",Lolita,R,1998,2.5
556,"Though the opener last year brought in $860 million throughworldwide distribution and earned thirteen Oscar nominations, I'mno more the target audience for the ""Lord"" trilogy than I am forRichard Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle.  Watching this blaze of cinematicglory, then, I pretended that ""The Two Towers"" is allegorical, thatthe characters in the movie are stand-ins for real life people intoday's political world. Let's see how.  The title ring confers great, albeit ambiguous,power on whoever possesses it, which makes the chief hobbit,Frodo (Elijah Wood) together with his Sancho Panza-like Sam(Sean Astin) determined to destroy it.  Therein lies the onlyopportunity for peace in the Middle Earth, now presumably at themercy of the white-bearded and white-garbed Saruman(Christopher Lee) who is determined to rule the world like somescuzz out of 007.  A viewing of ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowshipof the Ring"" is not essential to pick up the story, which is framedas a struggle between the forces of good and the armies of evil. The principal newbie is a computer generated image thatspeaks gibberish, Gollum (Andy Serkis), a small, anorectic-thincreature that could have some out the final scene of ""2001` who isunderstood by Frodo while the audience gets the gist of hismeaning.  Gollum is actually a hobbit who went nuts by holdingonto the ring for centuries  Yet another computer generatedcharacter, amazing in its conception, is Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies), from the race of Ents, who is called upon to join theforces of good in the upcoming war. Though we have to listen to the nutcase nonsense spouted byGollum, we are riveted by the best parts of the movie, the battleswhich are many and not far between.  On the side of good,Gandalf (Ian McKellen) survives an awe-inspiring drop into thebowels of the Earth, assumed to be lost forever in a ferocious fightwith the dragon-like Balrog.   For romance we get the strange joining in kisses of Arwen the elf(Liv Tyler) and Aragorn, the handsome human (Viggo Mortensen),which seems to be to come out of the blue and is hardly the sortof sizzler that could have lost ""The Two Towers"" its PG-13 rating. The series of battles is merely a preparation for the Big One,which takes place in Helm's Deep, in which a collection ofalliances join in an Armadeggon-like struggle against the evilSaruman and his large, well-armed armies to say nothing ofSaruman's power to put even a good king (Theoden played byBernard Hill) under spells to render him powerless. Now then, my apologies to those who think that SaddamHussein is merely a comical dictator without the ability to makewar against the great powers, but to me, Saddam is the evilwizard Saruman.  As Saruman casts a spell on the good KingTheoden, so the Iraqi dictator works his charms on the people ofhis country who elect him with 100% of the vote. (Never mind thatthe Kurds were as likely to vote for him as the Jewish seniors inFlorida were to vote for Pat Buchanan.)  As Saruman gatherstogether his alliance, so Mr. Hussein attempts to convince theMuslim world that the upcoming war is a clash of civilizations,requiring all followers to ally themselves against the West.  As thegoverning bodies on the continent of Europe are reluctant to jointhe U.N. in fighting Iraq but are expected to do so once the actionbegins, so does Treebeard believe that ""this is not our war,"" thatis, until he realizes that the bad wizard is about to torch him andhis fellows. The convoluted plot notwithstanding, what gives the ""Lord""trilogy its heft, its huge box office, are the special effects(supervised by Jim Rygiel), particularly the character ofGollum whose insanity makes him out to do nasty things to thehobbits until Frodo convinces him to snap out of it and comearound to the right side.  Aside from the genius of Gollum'screation, this CGI is the one character with conflicting motivesamid thousands who are convinced of the morality of the sidesthey have chosen.  We marvel at the storm clouds of war, thebevy of arrows that darken what little exists of sun, the camerawhich in the hands of Andrew Lesnie swoops across the heightand depths of Middle Earth to set the stage for Armageddon whilecapturing the David-and-Goliath struggle of the outnumberedforces of good.  If a real story about real people is what you prefer,then you'd best choose among the more weighty films, comedies,musicals and melodramas alike, such as ""Adaptation,"" ""AntwoneFisher,"" and ""About Schmidt.""","Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers, The",PG-13,2002,3
557,"In the two years since the release of 2001's ""The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring,"" awareness and general fandom for thefilm adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy trilogy has grownto near-astronomical levels. At this point, to not be familiar withthe story of Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, and the rest of the charactersis to be living on a different planet than the rest of us. And thanksto director Peter Jackson's grandiosity in scope and imagination,passion for the source material, and skill at emotional adeptness,""The Lord of the Rings"" has, for many people, ceased being a meremotion picture and become something more akin to a spiritual experience.  If ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was a tightly executed, exciting openerthat naturally lacked a conclusion, and 2002's ""The Two Towers"" wasa disappointing, generally sloppy and dull follow-up that had no beginningor end, then the final installment, ""The Return of the King,"" notonly improves upon the latter, but also surpasses all expectationsset up by the former. So majestic, so magical, so awe-inspiring, sobehemoth in scale, and so extraordinarily brought to lif e is nearlyevery minute of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" thatit not only breaks the curse of the lacking third feature in trilogies(i.e. ""The Return of the Jedi,"" ""The Matrix Revolutions""), but itmakes its predecessors look positively quaint in comparison. To saythat ""The Return of the King"" is this already-classic trilogy's paramountachievement is to understate things.  Once again, director Peter Jackson has made it imperative that viewersbe more than a little familiar with the two previous films, wastingno time dropping us into the middle of the narrative. As hobbits Frodo(Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue to make their way to Mordor'sMount Doom to destroy the dangerously sacred One Ring, emaciated,muliple-personalitied guide Gollum (Andy Serkis) attempts to leadFrodo into the path of danger and turn him against best friend Samin a secret attempt to steal the ring for himself. With the intoxicatingallure of the ring taking its toll on the exhausted Frodo, Sam suddenlyfinds himself gaining the strength needed to see that they both completetheir mission, or die trying.  Meanwhile, with Rohan's battle at Helm's Deep behind them, wizardGandalf (Ian McKellen) and hobbit Pippin (Billy Boyd) set out forthe city of Minas Tirith to warn the citizens of an imminent invasion,while human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), elf Legolas (OrlandoBloom), hobbit Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies)go looking for other forces to fight beside them in the ultimate battle for Middle Earth.  As much of an awesome technical triumph as ""The Fellowship of theRing"" and ""The Two Towers"" were, it is clear that director Jacksonwas saving all of his major goodies for last. ""The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King"" not only raises the bar to even grander heights,b ut it may very well go down as one of the most astounding visualspectacles ever made, and with good reason. The enormity of this concludingchapter does not only cover its running time (at 201 minutes, it isover twenty minutes longer than the other pictures and at least threetimes as entertaining as ""The Two Towers""), but also its flawlessaesthetic artistry. Even if it doesn't seem possible going in, ""TheReturn of the King"" stands as a new watermark for the evolution ofvisual effects. So realistic are they, and so seamlessly are theywoven into the sweeping exhilaration of Andrew Lesnie's cinematography,that one immediately stops thinking of the computer-generated imagesas effects and believes them to be nothing but genuine.  In retrospect, the choppy, underwhelming Battle at Helm's Deep featuredin ""The Two Towers"" seems to have been a deceptiv e plea on Jackson'spart for audiences to believe he was incapable of pulling off large-scalebattle sequences. In ""The Return of the King,"" he pulls the rug outfrom under the viewer in a joyous way, unleashing a two-part assaultknown as the Siege of Minas Tirith and the Battle of Pelennor Fieldsthat has to be seen to be believes. Bringing together most of thecharacters and different breeds of creatures for the first time, thisone-hour-plus action setpiece is one of the cinema's most rousing,riveting, mind-blowing stretches of eye and ear candy to ever be conceived.These battles are more than just a lot of noise and fire; they involvestrategy, intelligence, narrative coherence, and a progression ofthe plot that proves to be fully satisfying.  ""The Return of the King"" is an immersive experience, never less thantruly involving and wondrous. Because of this, its couple flaws donot weigh down on the film as a whole in any significant way likethe more readily apparent pro blems with ""The Two Towers"" did. Inadapting such an immense novel to film, rough edges are bound to befound, anyway, and the editing by Jamie Selkirk and Annie Collinsis this go-round's biggest offender. The wide range of locations thefilm switches back and forth from in the opening hour can become challengingto sort out, and certain story threads disappear for what in the film'stimeline is several days, but are picked up in the same spot wherethey were left off. These transitions are jarring, but not catastrophic in the long run.  The lovely performances from the recurring cast hold more poignantresonance and significance than they have in the past, because bythis time a generous amount of time has been spent developing themand their plight. Andy Serkis, with the help of the photorealisticCGI used to mimic his movements, is once again an unforgettably hauntingand oddly endearing presence as Gollum, and Ian McKellen (2003's ""X2"")reclaims the alternating warmth and regal command of Gandalf afterbeing pushed to the wayside in ""The Two Towers."" Finally separatedfrom each other and, thus, gaining an identity of their own are hobbitcousins Merry and Pippin, who before were basically interchangeableboth physically and in their personalities. Billy Boyd (2003's ""Masterand Commander: The Far Side of the World"") is particularly superbas the frightened Pippin, who is put under the watchful eye of theselfish Steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), and in one incendiaryscene is forced to sing as his comrades set off into battle.  The undoubted standouts of ""The Return of the King,"" however, areElijah Wood (1999's ""Black and White"") and Sean Astin, as Frodo andSam. It is through their heartfelt bond that exposes the true centerof ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which is that of a love story,non-sexual in nature, between two best friends who come close to losingeach other and must fight to prevail. Astin is simply heartbreakingand worthy of awards notices; his Sam started off in the trilogy assomething of a sidekick, but has grown to be the film's real hero.The frustration and fear he feels in losing Frodo to the power ofthe ring is intimately felt, as is the strength he finds in himself to carry on.  The final twenty minutes of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return ofthe King"" may seem extraneous to some viewers. Indeed, one highlyemotional scene is followed by another highly emotional scene, eachone gratifying and lovely. They consistently appear to be the actualending until the movie proceeds further , tying up loose ends andpressing forward as much as four years into the future. However, savefor the real last scene, which could have probably been discardedwithout any dire effect, this elongated epilogue is necessary. Itexposes the trilogy to, first and foremost, be about the loss of innocence,and the difficulty in returning to one's old life after it is strippedof them. This is a heavy, thought-provoking theme, to be sure, andit proves that what director Peter Jackson has done with ""The Lordof the Rings"" encompasses anything ever attempted before in the fantasy genre.  No matter how monstrously big, fantastical, and special effects-heavyit becomes, then, what separates it from most other motion picturesof its type is that it never loses sight of its humanity. ""The Lordof the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a triumph of cinematic craft,energy, and originality, and on more than a few occasions it borderson downright brilliant.","Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The",PG-13,2003,3.5
558," Some films are excellent from the start, and it is a matter of trying to seeif it can hold up to the tremendous task of copying the human spirit in allits glory.  Despite the reviews, which claimed a very poor accent by NickNolte's character, this film is really as strong and beautiful example ofwhat the art form can really do, but often does notbecause too many producers are in it for the money, too much so, rather thancelebrate the beauty of the human spirit, in its many forms.  A young man, is found to have a debilitating disease ( ALD/MYELEN ) of thebrain, which eventually eats up the young person's body, one inch  at atime. And at the time it was inconceivable that anyone would really want todo anything about it, specially the medical establishment.  The Agostos, donot take that lightly, and try anything, with a few hints and help from adoctor who happens to be a bit of a skeptic of his owncolleagues, and the parents battle does not end, until there is somethingwhich seems to work, to stop the terrible disease from continue on itsdestructive path.  And after fighting the medical establishment, including afew nurses who don't give a damn, and do not think the young man will evermake it, they finally find, amidst many studies, and papers, and informationa few things which might help the child.  And they proceed to try thesethings, until something works.  The first one being the most critical, thebuild up of fatty acids, which destroys many nerve cells.  Eventually they find someone who will co-operate, and a stodgy old foggiewho is patient enough to get the necessary syrup, which they believe willhelp.  And an Italian company decides it is worth  sending it around.  Afterthis effort, the parents have now to gain over the association which onlybelieves in the pain and the suffering ( I have seen the ADA do the same fortheir menders ) in order to get more attention by the medical establishment,who up until now have not been too helpful, with the exception of the goodGreek doctor, who is afraid to commit to a therapy, but does givesuggestions as to how it should be applied, and eventually defends thefamily who has done such incredible research, and accomplished what manymedical teams could not.The Agostos, have managed to get their closest friends, the wife's sister calls herself a test rat ) and a neighbour whose son is also just acquiredthe disease, a genetic disorder carried by the mother.  At the meeting of the sad feelings society, one of the mothers starts therevolution which the Agostos need, which is their involvement in publicizingthe success of the radical medicines, with ample proof that it is working.  The young man Lorenzo is still alive today, and the nerve cells arerebuilding very slowly.  George Miller has written this film, in a style that is similar to at leastone of his efforts, THE ROAD WARRIOR.  The film oversees several years inthe process, and the chapter format seems to work very well here.  In bitsand pieces that together bring the film to a triumphant conclusion, thoughthe battle is not won as yet, but could at any time.  Susan Sarandon, as the wife is superb, and worthy of her nomination for anOscar.  While Nick Nolte is also very good, his style is  very nice, thoughat times a bit difficult to understand, but then, so are many foreigners,and so what?.  Beautifully directed, and lovingly treated, this film is a must see for manyviewers. ",Lorenzos Oil,PG-13,1993,3.5
559,"""Closer,"" directed with a surgical workmanlike quality by Mike Nichols(2000's ""What Planet Are You From?""), is a motion picture of startsand stops„not involving the pacing, which is slow but always absorbing,but within the horribly dysfunctional relationships between its fourcharacters. Supporting roles are defunct, the film taking place ina self-contained bubble in which other people live, but, for all intentsand purposes, do not exist outside of being window dressing. Whatis left are these four souls„obituary writer Dan (Jude Law), youngstripper Alice (Natalie Portman), photographer Anna (Julia Roberts),and dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen)„who seemingly choose destructionover happiness, meeting cute in sequences that would be right at homein the romantic comedy genre before the movie switches to the endof their romances when passion and emotional connection is gone. Theirbehavior is inexcusable and, at times, downright maddening. In theirown way, however, and whether viewers are willing to admit it or now,they begin to take on patterns and make very bad choices that resembleone's we have all made„or, at least, considered„in our own past. As the picture begins, Dan witnesses the self-described waif, Alice,get hit by a car while crossing a busy London street. Taking her thehospital to get treated for some scrapes and bruises, they begin totalk and soon have fallen in love. Switch forward a year, Dan sharesa passionate kiss with stranger Anna, who has been chosen to photographhim for his impending book release. They go no further than this,but meet another year later at Anna's photography exhibit, where feelingsfor each other are discovered to still be mutual. By this time, Annais in a serious relationship with Larry, whom Dan unknowingly broughttogether through a thought-to-be-harmless sex chat deception wherehe posed as Anna. As couples break up in exchange for new relationshipsthat, they discover, offer no more satisfaction than the one's theywere already in, Alice eventually has a sexual encounter with therejected Larry at a strip club she works at. Written by Patrick Marber (based on his play), ""Closer"" is destinedto elicit deep conversations for anyone who sees it. It is not aneasy film to embrace, despite grabbing the viewer's attention fromthe beginning and refusing to let go, because it features four characterswho start off likable before becoming more despicable with each newscene. They are all self-destructive, yes, but they are also hypocritesin the biggest sense, willing to have affairs and give in to temptationseven as they resent their partners who all, at some point, do theyvery same thing. Black as coal and uncompromisingly grim, ""Closer""is an arresting drama in the vein of filmmaker Neil LaBute's oeuvre(1998's ""Your Friends & Neighbors,"" 2003's ""The Shape of Things"")that just so happens to involve an insufferable lot who, if they existedin your real life, you would walk on the opposite side of the streetto avoid. In certain actions, they, indeed, symbolize the darker sideof common human nature. By the end, they have sunken to an even lowerlevel that is difficult to apprehend, let alone understand. The performances, free of vanity, and the juicy, at times sexuallyexplicit, dialogue they throw off each other are the key reasons why""Closer"" remains a film worth noting. The actors are near the topof their game as they tackle difficult characters to wrap around,with Julia Roberts (2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"") probably surprisingthe most with the amount of unaffected depth she brings to Anna throughher facial expressions and line deliveries. Having such a huge starin a film outside of the mainstream realm always runs the risk ofcalling attention to itself, but Roberts so magnificently embodiesthe whole of Anna that she avoids this trap. As Alice, who seems atthe onset to be the most virtuous of the leads before late developmentsprove this to might not be the case, Natalie Portman delivers hersecond stunning, nuanced performance of the year, following ""GardenState."" At only 23, Portman is able to bring a lived-in soulfulnessto Alice that someone twice her age would likely have trouble equaling.As male counterparts Larry and Dan, Clive Owen (2002's ""The BourneIdentity"") and Jude Law (2004's ""Alfie"") offer intensely good turnsof their own. If there is a debit, it is that Law's recent overexposure„bythe end of the year, he will have appeared in six high-profile moviesin a four-month span„has grown tiresome. No fault of Law's, but hisundeniably pretty face has begun to wear out its welcome. Each sequence in ""Closer"" is something of a war of words that makeup individual short features, all of them provocative and gripping.There are genuinely sweet moments early on, including the day Danand Alice share together as they walk around the city following heraccident, and another scene in which Anna and Larry awkwardly meetby chance at an aquarium and share an almost instant bond. For themost part, though, the film's tone is somber and downright brutal,as in the confrontation between Larry and Anna when she tells himshe's leaving him for Dan, their damaging honesty cutting each otherlike knives. Another sequence between Larry and Alice in the backroomof the strip club is a bravura ten minutes of sharply written andacted precision, as they dance around the real subjects at hand andtempt each other as a respite to their failed relationships with Anna and Dan. If ""Closer"" is superb in sections, it all adds up to much less asa whole. By focusing solely on the characters' key encounters witheach other„in order, Dan and Alice, Dan and Anna, Anna and Alice,Anna and Larry, Alice and Larry, and Larry and Dan„director Mike Nicholshas neglected to delve into who these people truly are and why theydo what they do. Perhaps his point is that there is no point to whatDan, Alice, Anna, and Larry do„they are the biggest victims of theirown indiscretions„but it makes for a slightly disconcerting cinematicoutcome. ""Closer"" doesn't offer much audience satisfaction becausethey are placed in the character's terminally unsatisfied shoes, butit does welcome, and even demand, conversation and post-screeningdiscussions. The film is an uncompromising experience, which provesto be a simultaneous detriment and godsend to the finished product,but the sumptuous performances and tantalizing dialogue make eventhe most detestable of human behavior uncontrollably fascinating. ",Loser,PG-13,2000,2
560,"      Few directors have such a unique, some would say bizarre, styleas David Lynch.  He received Academy Award nominations for THE ELEPHANTMAN and BLUE VELVET, but other pictures of his, such as DUNE and WILDAT HEART, have been panned by many.  His latest, LOST HIGHWAY, is hismost unorthodox film yet, but one of his better ones.       The press kit describes the movie as a ""psychogenic fugue"" and a""Moebius strip"" with elements of Lewis Carroll and Franz Kafka.  Yes,it is all of those and more.       LOST HIGHWAY blends film noir with the tension of a horror movie.The power comes from the director's use of silence.  Characters aregenuinely frightened by what is happening to them because they cannotfigure it out.  They react with stunned silence.  (As you read thisreview you may be inclined to conclude that you have no interest inseeing the movie, but the film works more effectively than any possibleverbal description of it might lead you to believe.)       When Renee Madison (Patricia Arquette) comes into the house withan unmarked envelope she found on her front steps, her husband Fred(Bill Pullman) inquires, ""What's that?""  After a long pause, sheanswers, ""a videotape.""  Another pregnant pause, and then he asks,""Who's it from.""  She ponders for a while and then tells him, ""I don'tknow.""  When they play the tape, its abstruse message is a two secondvideo clip of the front of their house followed by the loud hiss ofblank tape.       The sound effects editing and the music enhance the heavy tension.At first, the film has complete silence interspersed with dialog -- nobackground ambient noise at all.  Slowly, low natural background soundsare introduced and then this gives way to music consisting of long, lowrumbling notes designed to frighten.       I see so many films that I get somewhat desensitized, but thefirst part of this movie managed to scare me badly with devices asnatural as the sudden, loud ringing of a phone.  An intense and verydisturbing film in the beginning.  When the parameters of the mysteryare revealed, the tension stays, but the film becomes much lessdisquieting.       I am not going to cover any of the film's details.  I will justset up the first few minutes of the film.  Suffice it to say that thefilm involves character transformation, reincarnation, surreal dreams,and more.       To give a feel of what is in store for the viewers, consideranother early scene.  Fred meets an inexplicable ""Mystery Man,"" playedby Robert Blake, at a party at someone else's home.  ""I'm at your houseright now,"" the man tells Fred.  Handing Fred a cell phone, hechallenges him to, ""Call me.""       The script by Barry Gifford and David Lynch perplexes the viewerswith all of the false views and disconcerting realities of an Escherprint.  An omnipresent, but an identifiable fear dominates thepicture's landscape.       Some of the vignettes in the film are priceless.  My favoritecould become an educational video for traffic schools.  After viewinghow a gangster known as Mr. Eddy (Robert Loggia) treats tailgaters,drivers will never dare follow too closely again.       The cinematography by Peter Deming pushes the limits of the filmnoir motif.  Not only are scenes dark but some characters walk intothe darkness and disappear as if into an astronomical black hole.The costumes and sets, both by Patricia Norris, portray a world ofstark black and white images which, of course, make the red blood allthe more dramatic by contrast.       I was caught up in LOST HIGHWAY's labyrinth.  You can think ofthe show as a film constructed with non-Euclidean geometry.  I stilldon't understand it, but the movie is not made to be comprehensible.What is less satisfying is the way characters caught in a deadly websuch as this never seek advice on what is happening to them.  Theclosest they come in LOST HIGHWAY is seen when mechanic Pete Dayton(Balthazar Getty) laments, ""Why me?""  The answers to this and all ofthe film's conundrums are in the final analysis, unknowable.       LOST HIGHWAY runs needlessly long at 2:15.  It is rated R forgraphic violence, sex, nudity, and profanity.  Teenagers should bemature if they go.  I was fascinated by this long enigma so Irecommend it to you and give it ***. ",Lost Highway,R,1997,2
561,"""Lost in Translation"" is a delightfully nuanced look at aconnection that's more than just friendship, a romance that fallsshort of consummation.  As a bonus, photographer Lance Acordshows us a Tokyo (with a brief look at Kyoto for contrast) that,like the relationship between the two principal characters, hasapparently left a strong memory on the film's director, SofiaCoppola (""The Virgin Suicides"").  The ideal audience for ""Lost inTranslation"" must be those tired of car chases and explosionswhile at the same time overly satiated with romances thatalways lead to hot sex and adolescent buddy moviesaccompanied by vulgarity.     You don't have to be a world traveler that is, one who hasbeen to places abroad other than Cancun to know that being ina profoundly foreign culture can affect you in two disparateways.  On the one hand, away from your routine job and groceryshopping, you get a chance to think about how your life is goingso far, make resolutions that you're bound to break, and returnhome the same person you've always been albeit with a fewnice memories. On the other hand, immersed in a land whereyou find communicating with the locals so difficult that you can'torder a decent meal in a restaurant or find your way back to thehotel, you may feel frustrated to the point of wanting to yell,""Getme out of here!""  Whatever anxieties you've experienced athome will be more pronounced, yet at the same time thetemporary rootlessness will open you to relationships that wouldprobably never bloom in your own back yard.     Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson)are frequently on their own during their days in Tokyo,experiencing a loneliness encourages them to open up to eachother.  Though each has a support group Bob, an Americanmovie star who is in Japan to film a whiskey commercial, issometimes surrounded by company hosts, while Charlotte,accompanying her frequently on-call photographer husband(Giovanni Ribisi), has some Japanese contacts the two findtrouble sleeping.  Their chance meeting would not haveamounted to anything back home.  He, perhaps in his earlyfifties, is undergoing a mid-life crisis despite the big bucks he isaccustomed to getting; she, in her twenties, has just graduatedfrom a university with a degree in philosophy and has no ideawhat to do with her life.  They meet and part--in the hotel's NewYork lounge, in restaurants, on the street--and meet and partagain.  When they return home to their separate lives, we feelsure they will have what travel agents promise but rarely deliver:memories to last a lifetime.     Thankfully using high speed film rather than digital video,lenser Lance Acord portrays the commercial areas of Tokyo asthough a modern, clean Times Square.  Neon is everywhere,people are wall to wall, virtually no Japanese speak English nordo tourists speak Japanese presenting a vacuum into which apair of American strangers could get to know each other atbroadband speed.  With a few instances of probableimprovisation by the immensely talented Bill Murray, ""Lost inTranslation,"" utilizing a script by the director with rapid editing bySarah Flack, takes Charlotte and Bob on the rounds of thisexotic, frenzied capital where they run into expected cultureshock.  Choosing from a restaurant with photographs of thedishes all of which look alike Bob and Charlotte consume oneof the worst meals of their lives.   On a talk show, a host onspeed speaking rapidly and subverting an American stereotypethat the Japanese are restrained with strangers, stuns Bob withclowning around that he can scarcely comprehend.  Charlottejoins Bob at a strip club that could easily be the set of PaulVerhoeven's ""Showgirls.""       Bill Murray is as different from Bernie Mac as comics can get. He keeps his audience smiling if not roaring with laughter by hisexpressions rolling his eyes exquisitely, smoking a cigar whiledrinking whiskey and keeping his head down, talking to hisCalifornia wife on a cell phone while soaking in the tub asthough recuperating from a twelve-hour flight.  By simply lookingat the camera he can elicit broad grins from his fans in theirtheater seats.  Scarlett Johansson is adept at offering at once avulnerability and a wisdom beyond her years, making her ever-seeking character a splendid match for a Murray-in-crisis.  Bythe conclusion of the story, you'll think of the strange andsometimes amazing relationships you've had during your life:The friendships that were superficial, the meaningfulconnections you've had that did not work out and left youheartbroken, the ties you've enjoyed which, like those of theprincipals in Coppola's movie were more than friendship, lessthan sexual.

562," ""Lost in America"" is a very funny comedy from Albert Brooks (who also made 1996's ""Mother""), about an unhappy married couple (Brooks and Julie Hagerty) in their 30's who are stuck in high-paying jobs that are going nowhere, and feel like their lives are just passing them by. When Brooks finds out that the execute vice manager position has been passed over him to another worker, they decide to quit their jobs, sell everything they own, purchase a motor home, and set out on the open road together. It's what they've always wanted to do, and besides, they are hoping it will save their marriage. Predictably, things immediately don't go as planned when they stop in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows and Hagerty loses all of their money gambling.  ""Lost in America"" isn't necessarily an original film, and it knows it isn't (there are various references to it being exactly like ""Easy Rider"", and it is very similar to the delightful 1950's comedy, ""The Long Long Trailer,"" starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz), but what saves it from being completely cliched is the highly enjoyable and witty screenplay by Albert Brooks and Monica Johnson. The dialogue, as in all of Brooks' films, is sharp and funny, and he and Hagerty make a great team. In fact, they are so charismatic together, I'm surprised they've never reteamed for a film. Now, that's an idea!  ""Lost in America"" was so good throughout that the film easily had the potential to be a great comedy, like the similar ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" but it feels much too short, and just when you think it should be hitting the 3/4 mark, it ends, as if they forget to film a conclusion. When the end credits started to roll, I was disappointed because I felt like there was so much more that could have been done, but wasn't.  Nonetheless, Albert Brooks' ""Lost in America"" is so entertaining the whole way through that it certainly should not be missed. It's a perfectly good way to spend an hour-and-a-half. ",Lost in America,R,1985,2.5
563," Back in February at the monthly Los Angeles Comic Book and Science FictionConvention, New Line Cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screenupdate of the cult 1960s sci-fi TV show Lost in Space, complete within-person appearances by cast members Mimi Rogers, Matt LeBlanc, LaceyChabert, Jack Johnson, and even Gary Oldman.  That should have set off mywarning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation tookplace at the convention was nearly five years ago, when none other thanArnold Schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle... Last ActionHero.  But no, like millions of others, I bought into the hype and ""gotLost.""  If only I had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre andspared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbusterwannabe.  You may find yourself wondering if director Stephen Hopkins andscreenwriter Akiva Goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film.At the convention, Goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the originaltelevision series, and if that really is the case, I'd hate to see what hedoes with concepts he only has mild interest in.  To say that his scriptlacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to beginwith--which there most certainly is not.  After the setup, in which theRobinson family--father John (William Hurt, looking and sounding as spacedout as he does in interviews), mother Maureen (Rogers, wasted), daughtersJudy (Heather Graham, ditto) and Penny (a heavily made-up Chabert, lookinglike a junior version of Neve Campbell in Wild Things), and son Will (youngnewcomer Johnson, making the best of it)--and pilot Don West (LeBlanc,doing a bad Han Solo impression) find themselves lost in space after theirship is sabotaged by evil stowaway Dr. Smith (a watered-down butstill-lively Oldman, cashing a paycheck and loving every minute), thescript's ""stream"" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seemsto be made up as it goes along--and Hopkins does little to make what doesgo on the slightest bit interesting.  They encounter another ship.  Theyboard it.  Alien spiders attack them.  They return to their ship.  Theother one explodes.  They land on a deserted planet.  And so on.  Anattempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act, butGoldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such astory device; when one character's past self dies, the future incarnationinexplicably lives on.  The look and effects should be Lost in Space's ace-in-the-hole, butHopkins even manages to botch that.  For a big-budget film, the visualeffects are incredibly shoddy.  In one composite background shot, I couldsee the blue outline around Oldman; the various digital effects for thespace battle scenes look like... digital effects.  But nothing in thoseshots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as Blawp, a monkey-like spacecreature that becomes Penny's pet.  Entirely computer-generated and everyinch showing it, Blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a SonyPlayStation game.  Apparently Hopkins thought the same and trieddesperately to hide it; how else can one explain the graininess of Blawp'scomposite shots with the human actors?  But in doing so, the seams are thatmuch more obvious.  You have to be severely visually impaired to not bedistracted when a grainy shot of Penny and Blawp is immediately followed bya crystal-clear solo reaction shot of Judy.  New Line is hoping Lost in Space will become a big franchise much like thelong-running Star Trek cash cow at Paramount.  I don't think so.  In a fewyears, the Lost in Space movie will likely live on not as a series but asthe obscure answer to a trivia question:  What film ended Titanic's 15-weekreign at the top of the weekend box office? ",Lost in Space,PG-13,1998,1
564,"a3atching ""Love Actually,"" one could easily imagine it being directedby Robert Altman if he offered cutesy characterizations and plot developmentsand tidy, upb eat conclusions. The film has a sprawling cast of overtwenty lead roles, their lives loosely and not so loosely interwoven,and, indeed, even opens with a recording session just as Altman's1975 masterpiece ""Nashville"" did. Plagiarism or homage? Either way,this connection was surely not incidental. In fact, replace countrymusic and politics with love as its focal subject matter and, voila,""Love Actually"" is born. Keeping a scorecard of all of the characters and their relations withone another would not be a bad idea, although as written and directedby Richard Curtis (2002's ""About a Boy"") it isn't nearly as confusingas it's about to seem. Recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson) is worriedhow his 11-year-old son, Sam (Thomas Sangster), is coping with thedeath of his mother, while Sam is just as preoccupied with the lovehe feels for popular classmate Joanne (Olivia Olson). Daniel's sister,Karen (Emma Thompson), believes she is happily married to Harry (AlanRickman) until she secretly discovers he is contemplating an affairwith his young assistant, Mia (Heike Makatsch). Daniel and Karen'sother brother is the new British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant), whobecomes distracted when he falls head over heels for his tea lady,Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Working with Harry and Mia is Sarah(Laura Linney), who has pined for handsome coworker Karl (RodrigoSantoro) for over two years, but has trouble getting close to anyonebecause of her dedication to her mentally challenged brother. Earlyon, Sarah attends the wedding of Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter(Chiwetel Ejiofor), whose best friend, Mark (Andrew Lincoln), harborsa painful secret crush on Juliet. Upon discovering his girlfriendis cheating on him, Juliet, Peter, and Mark's friend, Jamie (ColinFirth), falls in love with his Portuguese maid, Aureli a (Lucia Moniz),despite their language barrier. John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (JoannaPage) are porn actors who strike an undeniable connection during workon their latest film. Meanwhile, once-famous musician Billy Mack (BillNighy) is trying with all of his might to claim a comeback with hislatest song, a Christmas-themed cover version of ""Love is All Around.""All of these storiesand more, believe it or notplay out over the five-weekperiod before Christmas. ""Love Actually"" is so sweet, so cheerful, and so eager-to-please inits singular goal to be ""the ultimate romantic comedy"" that it almostseems wrong to say anything negative about it. Nonetheless, I will.As this 129-minute epic plays out, as a viewer you are in the momentand enjoying yourself. No scene runs longer than a minute or two,and the storylines and characters so quickly change that there isno time to grow tired of a particular segment. However, in jugglingso many different characters, no one is developed beyond surface-level.You may grow to like most of the people you meet, but there are onlya select few worthy of staking a claim on how things will turn out.The climax, as full of heart and good will as it is, threatens toput the viewer into sugar shock. The best segments undoubtedly belong to Colin Firth (2003's ""Whata Girl Wants"") and Lucia Moniz, who simmer with chemistry and charmas they form a tight bond without knowing each other's language; EmmaThompson (1998's ""Primary Colors""), whose reaction to her husband'saffair rings with truth and clarity; Liam Neeson (2002's ""K-19: TheWidowmaker"") and Thomas Sangston, whose winning, brutally honest fatherand son relationship garners laughs; and Hugh Grant (2002's ""Two WeeksNotice"") and delightful newcomer Martine McCutcheon, whose against-all-oddsromance comes to a satisfying head at the conclusion. The most genuinely romantic scene belongs to Andrew Lincoln and thestunning Keira Knightley (2003's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curseof the Black Pearl""), as he silently professes his undying love forher on her doorstep through simply written notecards. Less successfulis one character's trek to Wisconsin in search for American girls,whom he finds in the form of Elisha Cuthbert (2003's ""Old School""),January Jones (2003's ""American Wedding""), Ivana Milicevic (2003's""Down with Love""), Denise Richards (2003's ""Scary Movie 3"") , andShannon Elizabeth (2001's ""Thirteen Ghosts""). So far-fetched and over-the-topare these scenes that you keep expecting it to turn out to be a dream (it isn't). As a Christmas love story, ""Love Actually"" is, indeed, romantic andjubilant enough to become a holiday mainstay for adults. The film'sLondon setting is beautifully photographed by Michael Coulter (1999's""Notting Hill"") and it plays like a greatest hits of classic Christmastunes. Director Richard Curtis is dead set on not wasting a minuteof screen time, plowing forward with the abandon of Christmas carolersand believing that viewers will not have a moment to even considerhow fluffy and inconsequential the whole thing really is. ""Love Actually""succeeds at this, remaining pleasant and entertaining from beginningto end. Only once it is over do you unfortunately witness its stayingpower evaporate before your very eyes.",Love Actually,R,2003,3
565,"      LOVE AFFAIR is at least the third remake of the original 1939 LOVEAFFAIR.  Unlike SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE which was loosely based on theoriginal, this one shares most of the key story elements.  SLEEPLESS INSEATTLE was technically based on AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (1957) which wasin turn based on LOVE AFFAIR (1939).       This LOVE AFFAIR is about a famous football player turnedannouncer (Warren Beatty) and a waitress turned interior decorator,singer and child care worker (Annette Bening).  It features animportant cameo by Katherine Hepburn as the football announcer's aunt.It has other smaller cameos as well such as Ray Charles singing aclassic Christmas song of his.       The best way to describe this movie, also written by Beatty, isthat it is first and foremost, a mood piece.  The photography of Tahitiinterlaces the whole show as does the dominatingly loud music of the30s.  It leaves you with a sort of Bali High ambiance and the feelingof having drunk a soothing cup of warm tea on a foggy evening.       The camerawork is spectacular.  Watch Beatty and Bening walkthrough the lush green fields of Tahiti with the fog encased mountainsas their backdrop.  Watch the shadows on their faces on the front porchin Tahiti.  The whole show has the warm glow of a Renoir.  As atravelogue, as a tour de force in camerawork, and as a mood creator, itis excellent.       Where the movie falls down is the story and the characters.Beatty has a monotonic delivery style which makes it hard to believeshe really cares about anything.  Bening is SO lovely to look at (OK,OK, Beatty is not too bad looking either), but the lines she gives werenot convincing enough for me.  Yes, in real life they are a devotedcouple, but the romance they displayed in this movie was not believableor interesting.  They did have a few memorable lines, but on the wholeit just did not click.       I am not a fan of cameo rules by actors approaching senility.  Toooften the audience just ends up feeling sorry for the actors.Hepburn's performance was an exception to this rule.  Her part wasimportant, and she was good in it. ",Love Affair,PG-13,1994,2
566,"An urban remake of the cheesy but fun 1987 teen comedy, ""Can't BuyMe Love,"" ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" lifts that film's premise andgenerously sprinkles in similar scenes and dialogue exchanges. Whatit doesn't do is improve in any way on a motion picture that, let'sface it, wasn't that great to begin with. In comparison to the mean-spirited,tasteless, stereotypical treatment director Troy Beyer and co-writerMichael Swerdlick (who also penned the 1987 version) have done tothe materia l, however, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is a veritable masterpiece.Yes, ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" is that bad. High school senior Alvin Johnson (Nick Cannon) has always been considereda geek by the popular crowd, something he hopes to eradicate whenhe offers beautiful classmate Paris (Christina Milian) the money neededto fix her mom's wrecked car (she was driving it without permission).In return, Paris will hang out with Alvin for two weeks and help toraise his cool status. Just as Paris has begun to fall for Alvin,popularity changes his nice guy personality for the worst, leavingher and his real friends, Kenneth (Kenan Thompson), Walter (Kal Penn),and Chuck (Kevin Christy), out in the cold. ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" may outwardly seem like a harmless, fluffyteen flick, but it is rotten to the core and misogynistic in the extreme.All of the female characters are presented as one-dimensional twitswho delight in letting their player boyfriends use and then promptlydispose of them. The rest of the teenage characters are just as poorlyrealized and condescending. This might not have been so off-puttingin the long run had the central relationship between Alvin and Parisbeen the least bit endearing or fiery, but it isn't. After all, mostof the teenagers in ""Can't Buy Me Love"" were also stereotypes, butat its center was the believable and sweet love story between PatrickDempsey and Amanda Peterson. They portrayed roles that did have morethan one dimension, who had real interests and ideas, and who madea natural connection with one another. The moral of the storyto beyourselfmight have been handled in a syrupy fashion, but at leastit had its heart in the right place. ""Love Don't Cost a Thing"" seeminglywants to do the same thing, but its handling of this subject holdsthe sincerity of a rabid dog. Nick Cannon (2002's ""Drumline"") and Christina Milia n (1999' s ""TheWood"") seem to have the capacity for better performances in the future,but their parts of Alvin and Paris do them zero favors. For a movie'slead protagonist, Alvin is a despicable hero, and even when he realizesthe mistakes he has made, he doesn't seem genuine when he correctsthem. Paris, meanwhile, rolls her eyes so much at Alvin in the firstact that when she does a 180-degree turn and has supposedly fallenfor him, it seems like nothing more than a cheap necessity of theplot. Cannon and Milian are given so few scenes to develop their relationshipat the onset that what comes afterward collapses in a pile of dust.And because Cannon's Alvin is so unlikable, we actually find ourselvesrooting for Paris to ditch him for good and find someone more respectful.The only actor to escape unscathed in the wreckage is Steve Harvey(2003's ""The Fighting Temptations""), bringing heart and a couple oflaughs to his role of Alvin's father. His sporadic scenes are thesole bright spot in 100 minutes of worthlessness. I defy anyone to watch ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Love Don't Cost aThing"" back to back and tell me with a clear, honest conscience thatthis updated version is an improvement. Every scene lifted from ""Can'tBuy Me Love"" is markedly inferior hereless earnest and constantlyreaching for the lowest common denominator. The dialogue is also laughablyidiotic. ""You're off the hizzle,"" one character says, only for anotherto ask Alvin, ""What kind of car do you drizzle?"" Yep, that's aboutthe height of intelligence that this movie manages to ever reach.Even the final repugnant shot suggests that Alvin still hasn't actuallygrown as a person, making the entire thing pointless. If remakingpopular '80s teen films for urban audiences is to become a new fad,let's hope further efforts aren't as irrespon sible as ""Love Don't Cost a Thing.""",Love Don't Cost A Thing,PG-13,2003,1.5
567," An honest, passionate, and ultimately mysterious note is the subject of Peter Ho-Sun Chan's romantic comedy-drama, ""The Love Letter,"" based upon the novel by Cathleen Schine. There's a lot to like here, and even though it is only the start of the big summer movie season, it was nice to sit back, relax, and watch a movie about realistic people; it's just too bad the story surrounding the characters comes off as a mere contrivance, and that the supporting cast, all wonderful actors, are criminally wasted.  Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw) is a 40-ish single mother who lives in the quaint New England town with the dreamy title, Loblolly By The Sea. The fact that she has a young daughter is completely pointless to the film, since she is shipped away to summer camp during the opening credits to never be seen again. Helen works at one of those cute little bookstores that you only see in the movies; the kind that is constantly swarming with employees, but never has one customer. Maybe it's because the town is so small, or maybe it's because the residents are illiterate, or not big readers. Either way, how could they have the money to keep the shop in business? Anyway, one day Helen finds a love letter wedged between the cushions of a couch, and immediately believes that someone has written it for her. As she walks around the town daydreaming of all of the possible authors, she soon narrows down the list to George (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced father who has been her life-long friend, or Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), a 20-year-old college student working at the bookstore for the summer, who finds the note himself and believes it is from Helen. Things grow more complicated when Helen's best friend, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), discovers the letter and suspects it to be directed for her, while Helen starts to doubt her blossoming relationship with the much-younger Johnny and sets her sights on the more mature, lonely George.  ""The Love Letter"" is a very well-intentioned and mildly entertaining distraction from life, but at a too-short 88-minutes, the distraction is not nearly long enough, and is unnecessarily slight. The screenplay, written by Maria Maggenti, is fine with what it has, but desperately needs more meat to it, as the movie stubbornly centers directly on Helen, while the rest of the intriguing characters are more or less pushed to the wayside. Still, there are a lot of nice moments and a subtle deeper meaning that shines through with a quote that appears on the bookstore's chalkboard late in the film. Although the writer of the love letter is eventually discovered, the movie probably didn't even need to resolve such a thing, as the major thread running through the film is that of Helen's self-discoveries about herself, and her life. It was also a pleasant change of pace to include a conclusion that doesn't turn out quite as you might predict, but that is stronger because of its honesty.  Kate Capshaw, recently seen in numerous indie films (""The Locusts,"" ""The Alarmists""), jumped onto the scene in 1984's rousing adventure, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (where she met a guy named Spielberg and married him), but ""The Love Letter"" is her first major film vehicle in a long time. I like her, and yet it's funny how so many movies choose the most uninteresting character to be the center. This is exactly what happens in ""The Love Letter,"" as all of the characters around her are more original, starting with Tom Everett Scott, as the young man of Helen's desires. Scott has stumbled lately in such mediocre fare as ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" and ""Dead Man on Campus,"" but he has found a better role here. Playing off of him splendidly is Julianne Nicholson, a young woman closer to his age who has strong feelings for him, even though he's too concerned with Helen to really process it. But the absolute bright spot in the cast is Ellen DeGeneres, who is so very good in everything she's in that, if I were to make a movie, she'd be the first one I'd cast. She is the picture's comic highlight (as usual), but is not merely replaying her other characters, and has a serious scene with Capshaw that is perhaps the most powerful moment in the film. Meanwhile, Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart (her first role since ""Titanic"") briefly appear as Helen's mother and grandmother, but have nothing to do, particularly Stuart, one of the sweetest old ladies I've ever set eyes upon. It's a real shame she was put in such a throwaway role, but does garner a few laughs in only her three scenes.  Like Loblolly By The Sea, ""The Love Letter"" is an enjoyable enough way to spend an hour and a half, but doesn't end up having much to offer in the way of substance. On Oprah this week, Capshaw said that when she read the novel from which this adaptation stems from, she fell in love with the idea of it becoming a motion picture and immediately joined on as star and producer (it probably didn't hurt that she is married to Mr. Dreamworks SKG). Either the book must have been infinitely superior, or Capshaw should have definately held out for a better project. ",Love Letter,PG-13,1999,1.5
568,"Every so often an article appears listing the major sources ofstress on a scale of 1 to 100.  Losing your job, serious illness,divorce, all rank in the 90's.  Top of the list?  Death of yourspouse. That's 100.  When you wife or husband dies suddenly,unexpectedly, the stress is probably greatest.  Todd Louiso dealswith the reaction of two people near and dear to a young womanwho has committed suicide apparently without warning.  In ascreenplay written by Gordy Hoffman expressly for his brother,Philip Seymour Hoffman, ""Love Liza"" takes us into the minds ofthe victim's mother, Mary Ann Bankhead (Kathy Bates) and, farmore important, the film explores the reaction of the woman'shusband, Wilson (Philip Seymour Hoffman),  who has a visiononly once in flashback of his beloved. Since the film has been written by the protagonist's own brotherand since Philip Seymour Hoffman is in virtually every frame, youcould not be faulted for thinking this is a vanity production.  To anextent, you'd be right given the dimensions of the work, somethingthat could turn up on cable TV and does not need the big screento reinforce its effect.  But since director Todd Louiso is dealingwith the man's deterioration from within, made clear from thewonderful actor's facial expressions and reversion to childhoodbehavior, we can see why the movie took the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at Sundance early this year and why Hoffman couldconceivably be considered an Oscar candidate if enoughAcademy members ever get to see the work. Hoffman is shown almost throughout the hour and a half in hissignature disheveled appearance, often with a two- or three-daygrowth of hair on his face and a who-cares attitude about hisclothing-which is fine since he works with a bunch of youngcomputer nerds as a web designer.  Showing up at worksurprisingly soon after his wife's death, he seem unable fully toaccept the tragedy, particularly since he refuses to open a sealedenvelope containing a final letter written to Wilson by the woman. Given time off from his job, he becomes addicted to sniffinggasoline, which he buys repeatedly in 2-gallon cans from asuspicious proprietor in his town of Prescott, Arkansas. Announcing to a visitor, who smells gas, that he is buildingremote-control model planes, he makes good on his lie by buyinga model and winds up at a model boat competition with a rube-likefriend, Denny (Jack Kehler). Peopple have many methods for coping with tragedy, and ""LoveLiza"" explores the extreme way one man from Middle Americaoperates, or more accurately fails to deal within normalboundaries with his loss.  Hoffman performs in the role of a personwho despite his off-the-wall reaction is never less than believable,while Kathy Bates, as the mother of the dead woman who on thesurface appears to comfort her bereaved son-in-law, is goingthrough no small crisis herself.  Anyone who has loved and lostcan understand how irritating well-wishers can be with theirinsincere ""I'm here for you"" sympathies, but really, nobody canput together the pieces of a psychologically fragmented personbut the man himself.  Jim O'Rourke's almost ubiquitous soundtrack seems to mimic the silliness of the bereaved who like a littlekid takes to sleeping on the floor, grooving on model boats andplanes, and in a couple of instances even helping to corrupt acouple of pre-teens by giving them rags soaked in gasoline forthem to sniff.  By avoiding commercial glitz, Todd Louisosucceeds in getting under the skin of an individual in crisis.",Love Liza,R,2002,2.5
569,"Modern science, contrary to the thousands years ofidealistic philosophy, romantic poetry and fiction, claimsthat the love is nothing more than consequence of certainbiochemical processes in human body. Interestingly enough,this rather un-romantic notion was the premise for romanticcomedy. The name of that comedy was LOVE POTION NO. 9, andit was written and directed by Dale Launer in 1991.  The protagonist of this film is Paul Matthews (played byTate Donovan), nerdy scientist who works in biochemical labtogether with his equally nerdy female partner Diane Farrow(played by Sandra Bullock). Matthews doesn't have much luckin his dealings with opposite sex, so the friends tell himto visit Madame Ruth (played by Anne Croft), old Gypsyfortune-teller specialised for helping people with romanticproblems. Madame Ruth is ready to improve young scientist'sby offering him ""Love Potion No. 8"", elixir with powerfulaphrodisiac qualities. Matthews takes it, despite warningsabout some interesting side effects, but real problems arisewhen the potion gets in the hand of his partner. Both oftheir lives will be turned upside down until they realisethat they are made for each other.  Ancient pop songs seem like a rather strange inspiration forthe films, and it isn't hard to imagine such films beingequally unimpressive as those inspired by video games. LOVEPOTION NO. 9, based on the ""golden oldie"" performed by TheClovers, justifies that skepticism. Dale Launer's humour isnot very effective, even bellow the standards of 1980s teencomedies, and the actors don't seem to put much effort intheir work. There is perhaps one good scene in the entirefilm, but the most interesting thing about it is seeing whatpopular actresses like Sandra Bullock had to do beforereaching Hollywood Olympus. However, even the Bullock fanswould do themselves a favour if they skip this one and rentFIRE OVER AMAZON instead. ",Love Potion No. 9,PG-13,1992,0.5

""You take a step and are blown to pieces.""    This philosophical film by writer/director Valerie Breiman would have been more aptly titled REFLECTIONS ON RELATIONSHIPS, but, of course, the current title is a more marketable one.  Love and sex there is, but the characters spend more time discussing the twin subjects than engaging in them.  And when it comes to sex, Janssen would appear to have a no-nudity clause in her contract, since she stays partially clothed in situations which would much more naturally be engaged in without underwear.  Although most of the staging never quite rings true, the movie does commendably place both of the leads in real jobs that they actually go to.  Most cinematic characters appear to live off of some off-screen sugar daddy, permitting them to live without the toils of work.  Kate is a cubicle dweller at the headquarters of a women's magazine named ""Monique.""  Kate's only honest piece of writing -- about oral sex as a cure for depression -- is rejected by the magazine's eponymous owner, played without emotion by Ann Magnuson.    ""They say 'you have to kiss a lot of frogs to get a prince,'"" Kate tells us before finding hers, an avant-garde painter named Adam (Jon Favreau, the crazy cop in THE REPLACEMENTS) who likes to paint things like a woman with a severed head coming out of her rear.

Mine are just short ones,"" Kate explains to Adam after he finds out that he's number 14 on her relationship dance card.  ""You're like a whore!"" he tells her.  They have the sort of strange chemistry whereby they both think that it's funny that he calls her a whore.

He tries to prove that men age better than women by asking, ""Who's better looking: Sean Connery or Shelley Winters?""   The supporting cast of Kate's various other boyfriends includes Josh Hopkins as a Robert De Niro-obsessed porn star and Noah Emmerich as Eric, her number two.  Like the rest of the reflective characters, Eric is full of dating suggestions.  ""Scheduled spontaneity is the key to long-term love,"" he says.  As witty as the script is, the direction is way off the mark.  The cast almost uniformly suffers from a bad of case of low energy.  Scenes seem designed more for cuteness than believability.  And never is the chemistry between Adam and Kate genuine, which is the kiss of death for a romantic comedy.  Although the movie has some wonderfully acerbic moments and some insightful parts, it is basically forgettable fluff.

571,"      There is a moment -- actually two -- when local televisionreporter Max Brackett could have put an end to the hostage crisis thatends up gripping the nation.  Sam Baily, the none too bright,disgruntled employee has laid down his sawed-off shotgun.  As Sam turnshis back, Max has a brief opportunity to grab the weapon.  As anxietyflashes across forehead, Max's eyes draw a bead on the shotgun, but hisbody stays frozen.  His inaction guarantees the continuation of thestory of his career.       Famous director Costa-Gavras has to date created a body of workwith an underlying theme of tension and terror.  From his Academy Awardnominated direction of Z to his more recent efforts including MISSINGand MUSIC BOX, his films have a hard-edge that leaves moviegoerssquirming uneasily in their seats.       His most recent film, MAD CITY, represents a change of pace.Although the hostage situation might sound like his previous films, itisn't.  The script by Tom Matthews, based on a story by Eric Williamsand Matthews, stays firmly in the comedic range.  Partly a commentaryon media excesses and partly a black comedy, the script skirts a fineline between the two, which could be considered its major weakness.Had one or the other of them been more fully developed, it would havebeen a better movie.  And in the latter case it would have been evenmore like BROADCAST NEWS, the show it most closely resembles.  (RobertProsky plays roughly the same part as a newsroom executive in bothpictures.)       John Travolta, an actor with an increasingly wide acting range,plays Sam Baily.  With Sam's sad sack look, his pot belly, his rumpledclothes and his confused demeanor, he has bad luck written all overhim.  After being laid off from his eight-dollar-an-hour job as amuseum guard, he comes back to discuss it with the museum's director,played as prim and proper by a nattily dressed Blythe Danner.       Blue-collar worker Sam, lacking confidence, makes a big mistake bybringing along something to ensure that his ex-boss will pay him properattention.  With a gun and a bag of dynamite, his attempts atreasonable discussion rapidly get out of hand.  His gun goes offwounding his friend, the only other guard, and soon things go from badto worse -- but not for everyone.       Max Brackett, played to a tee by a pensive Dustin Hoffman, haslost his position at the networks and has been relegated to thetelevision minor leagues.  Sent by his boss, Lou Potts (Prosky), to doa feel-good piece at the local museum, Max ends up being in the restroom inside the museum when Sam finds himself with a wounded guard anda dozen school children as accidental hostages.  The situation soonescalates as Max manipulates the scene into a live story with himselfat the center of the storm.  Sounding like Rod Serling introducing a""Twilight Zone"" episode, Max intones his explanation of the crisis tothe rest of America.       ""A man has been shot; a line has been crossed,"" proclaims Max.The movie comes back again and again to the issue of crossed lines withthe implication that the warring reporters cross it repeatedly in anattempt to improve their poll numbers.  We flip back frequently to themen behind the scenes at the network who check poll numbers oneverything from the newscasters' market share to Sam's popularity.       Old timer Lou thinks the story has gotten out of hand.  ""Jeez, Isent you to cover a piece of fluff, and you come back with a hostagesituation,"" he complains to Max.  Like a man in a futile attempt tobattle a hurricane, Lou relinquishes control and lets the media feedingfrenzy begin.       Chief Lemke's (Ted Levine) first question to Sam stumps him.  Thechief wants to know Sam's demands.  Max, in total control of thesituation, becomes Max's instant mentor.  Max advises against askingfor the only thing Sam wants, his old job back.  ""You've got to ask fora fast car, a Learjet or a Greyhound bus,"" Max tells him, otherwisethey will not take you seriously.       When the story gets big, the network anchor, Kevin Hollander,shows up to try to muscle in on Max's story.  ""I'm who Americans trustfor their news,"" brags Kevin.  ""You really shouldn't let a marketingslogan go your head,"" retorts Max.  Alan Alda, who can do superciliouswith the best of them, plays Kevin.  To further complicate matters,Kevin was the source of Max's downfall from the networks after Maxembarrassed him in a live feed at a previous crisis.  With Sam's pollnumbers headed for the moon, Kevin smells gold on earth, arguing that""this guy's a poster child for the disenfranchised.""       The supporting cast is strong with the best being Max's youngassistant Lori, played by a perky Mia Kirshner.  When Kevin smiles ather and she realizes this hostage crisis could launch her career, offgo her nerdy clothes and her hesitant manner.  She starts dressing likean anchor and gets ready to walk over her dead mother's grave if needbe to get the story.       Meanwhile, back at scene of the crime, Sam wiles away his timeplaying Pied Piper with the kids as they raid the vending machines.And when night falls, he tells them stories of the local Indian tribe.       The defining moment in the show comes in a request from the bigboys at the network.  Could Max be so kind as to arrange for Sam tosurrender in prime time?  Oh, and could it be Thursday night since thatis when their ratings need the most help?       MAD CITY runs 1:50.  It is rated PG-13 for a few violent scenes, acouple of profanities and mature themes.  The show would be fine forkids 10 and up although they probably need to be teenagers to beinterested in the movie.  I recommend the film to you and give it ***",Mad City,PG-13,1997,2.5
572,"Whether married or not, an alpha male can usually findattractive women for his bed, when bored.  In some cases thereare overt marital consequences as the wives of suchplayboys ""accept"" the arrangement in order to maintain face(Mamie Eisenhower, Hillary Clinton, Eleanor Roosevelt).  Atother times the wives take strong action against their strayinghusbands (Clytemnestra, Medea, Princess Diana).  Even thoseof us without much sense of history must have figured out thatBill Clinton was not the first powerful man to stray.  VicenteAranda's picture ""Mad Love"" (""Juana la loca"" in the spokenlanguage of the film), helps to prove this point, showing uswhat one particular aggrieved wife does when her princewreaks havoc on their marriage.      Watching Vicente Aranda, one wonders how kids today couldfind history boring: on second thought, perhaps this is becausetextbooks tend to be insipid and the visual splendor of history isdenied since the students never get to see films like ""Juana laloca.""  To go a step further, how many people history majors orotherwise even heard of her?  This could be because her reignwas too short to affect Spanish history, but Juana, who might beshunned by feminists today as yet another one of the manywomen who love too much, was ahead of her time in herwillingness freely to expression her passion.      The film is anchored by solid work from Pilar Lopez de Ayala""Besos para today,"" ""Bailame el agua"")  as the titlecharacter whose chilling work is undermined by some oddlydetached acting from Daniele Liotti as Austrian Archduke Felipe.(Felipe's stiff performance in bed mirrors Liotti's work as anactor).  ""Juana la loca"" seems to assure us in the audience thathell hath no fury like a woman scorned.  Having been set up byher mother, Queen Isabella of Castile, to marry Felipe forpolitical reasons, the virginal 18-year-old Juana discovers lust atfirst sight upon setting eyes on the archduke in Flanders.  Herfeelings reciprocated, they marry that very day and entertain theladies in waiting who hover at the bedroom door and giggle toJuana's moans.       When Felipe gets enough of her, his eyes wander to otherswhile Juana, who is rightfully infuriated catching her man in bedwith one of the court ladies, is nonetheless so consumed by herpassion that she embraces the womanizer despite hisnumerous betrayals.  Ultimately, Felipe becomes fired more bya lust to become King of Castile than by his amorousadventures and arranges to have the assemblage of noblesdeclare Juana insane and name him Regent.     The action, which takes place at the turn of the SixteenthCentury, is  worthy instruction in court intrigue.  Anyone with theslightest interest in politics today sees a parallel between theconspiracy of Flemish nobles to put their main man on aSpanish throne and the iniquitous actions by Republicans inCongress to make a political mountain of Bill Clinton'swanderlust molehill.  While Lopez's performance excites thesenses, no one in the all-Spanish cast approaches her bravada,Moreover photographer Paco Femenia's canvas is badly lit andfalls far short of the big-budget excitement that is a hallmark oflavish costume dramas like Peter Greenaway's ""TheDraftsman's Contract,"" Philips Haas's ""Angels and Insects"" andmany of the glorious Merchant-Ivory productions.  See it forhistory, for its one solid performance, and think of what moremoney rightly spent could have done to make this bodice-rippermore soulful. ",Mad Love,PG-13,1995,0.5
573,"      Never has the value of school uniforms been better demonstratedthan in MADELINE.  Dressed in bright blue jumpers, starched whiteshirts with red and blue striped ties, straw hats with fire-engine redribbons - all set off nicely with banana-colored umbrellas, these9-year-old girls are the pictures of innocence.  It is almostimpossible to envision these sweet-looking little darlings beinginvolved in drugs or any of today's modern problems.       Director Daisy von Scherler Mayer, whose last movie was theatrocious WOO, captures perfectly the wholesome Madeline series ofchildren's picture books by Ludwig Bemelmans.  While rarely rising tothe captivating level, the movie stays firmly in the cute range.Little of consequence happens, but the story provides some nice littleadventures.       In the lead role of Madeline, cinematic newcomer Hatty Jones isprecious.  With her intense dark brown eyes and her cherubic, roundface, the camera loves her.  Her mildly rebellious Madeline leads therest of her girl's school in such escapades as forbidden raids on therefrigerator.  In one of the funniest scenes, she refuses to eat Fred,the once-live chicken with whom she had shared a car seat earlier inthe day.  She soon has almost the entire student body converted tovegetarianism.       As the worrywart nun, Miss Clavel, FARGO's Frances McDormand seemsmade for the role.  Popping up in the middle of the night and othertimes, she proclaims with dead-on premonition, ""Something is notright!""  She quickly scurries around amongst her girls searching forthe predicament of the moment.       The plot concerns the selling of the school by its crotchety ownerLord Covington, played by Nigel Hawthorne.  The girls, who refer to himas Lord Cuckooface, scheme to thwart the sale of the school.  Theyenlist the help of the devilish son of the Spanish Ambassador, Pepito(Kristian de la Osa), who lives next door to their school in Paris.  Asubplot, and probably the reason the show got a PG rather than a Grating, concerns a kidnapping plan by Pepito's teacher.  It is handledso delicately that the picture is effectively a G nevertheless.       Filmed in dark, serious tones by Pierre Aim, best known for themorose film HATE, the movie is set mainly to overcast Parisian skies.Only the happy colors of the girls' clothes, designed by MichaelClancy, keep the movie from having an inappropriately somber look.       Nothing can stop Madeline.  Even the guillotine - which Pepitoclaims he will use to execute a poor mouse to provide food for hismonstrous snake - doesn't faze her.  Madeline's ingenuity saves the daymore than once, and actress Hatty Jones saves the movie with herlikeable spunk. ",Madeline,PG,1998,2.5
574,"      THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE is a movie based on the play titled THEMADNESS OF GEORGE III.  It tells a little known story of King GeorgeIII of England during the time (1789) right after he had ""lost theColonies.""  (I have been told it was retitled for the US becauseAmerican audiences during the test marketing thought it was a sequeland wondered what happened in parts I and II, but I think that is justprobably just another urban legend.)       The king (Nigel Hawthorne) is a strong-headed man who seems tothose around him to be acting stranger and stranger.  His estrangedfirst son (Rupert Everett) seizes upon this and decides to try to gethis old man declared insane in which case he would get to be PrinceRegent.  This would effectively make him king, and, most important ofall, he would then get all of the king's vast income and wealth.          The loyal queen (Helen Mirren) stands by her man.  MeanwhileParliament splits on who to back with both sides caring only aboutpolitics and not a wit about the king or the prince.  The king's sideturns to a doctor played by Ian Holm.  Finally, Amanda Plummer plays aloyal lady-in-waiting to the Queen who is willing to do absolutelyanything to help her queen.  Many twists and turns from there with anending you may have some trouble predicting if you are not up on yourBritish history of that era.       The historical story is fascinating and is the only reason to seethe movie.  The period costumes are well done, and the sets arecarefully chosen.  The acting is earnest, and Hawthorne does tryawfully hard to present a believable madman.       On the bad side, the movie is extremely tedious and pedantic.  Forexample, I lost count of how many times the scriptwriter had us hearabout the color of the king's ""water"" and ""stool.""  Moreover, we had tohave numerous didactic lectures from doctors about the exact color ofthe king's ""water"" and much speculation on what the color meant.  Thebest doctors in the land were also treated as nothing but quacks. Perhaps they were, but I wonder about the historical accuracy of thiscaricature.  Finally, although the actors tried to give their bestperformances, I found that I did not care about any of the charactersas written, and this comes from a guy who has taken seven vacations toBritain and who knows a lot of English history. ","Madness of King George, The",PG-13,1994,1.5
575,"Magnolia is a long, awkward and ambitious movie. Writer/DirectorPaul Thomas Anderson creates some poignant moments but takes too longto get there. The movie is filled with big themes: forgiveness,overcoming past traumas and whether love can conquer all. Much ofMagnolia feels like the downbeat second half of Anderson's last film,Boogie Nights, with its relentless bad news for almost everyoneinvolved. But  Magnolia rarely has the fun and energy Boogie Nightshad in its first hour.  Everyone in Magnolia is in pain. All that pain is just too muchafter a while. Anderson is very intent on showing that no one is whatthey seem. Everyone who seems to be doing well actually hides a pasttragedy. The fine character actor Philip Baker Hall plays a big TVstar, the host of the longest running game show of all time, who isfalling apart, first slowly then rapidly. Like the multimillionaireplayed by Jason Robards, he's terminally ill and might also have asecret shame. Everyone who seems screwed up actually has a really goodreason for being that way. The truly irritating drug addict played byMelora Walters turns out to not only have an awful memory thatexplains why she's messed up but actually has a heart of gold and cancharm John C. Reilly's ridiculously clueless cop. Anderson did well in filling Magnolia with excellent actors. Afterhis uncomfortable performance in Eyes Wide Shut, it's good to see TomCruise at his best, in a cocky mode. In his scenes as a motivationalspeaker giving a room full of pathetic guys the confidence to hit onwomen, Tom Cruise is electrifying. He's less affecting in the laterscenes where he has to show vulnerability. Julianne Moore has a fewstunningly real moments but she's generally handcuffed by her patheticcharacter. She has one affecting scene where she's mortified when apharmacist, thinking she's a junkie, is unsure whether to fill herprescription but it's hard to have much sympathy for someone who'sbiggest problem is guilt about marrying someone for his money.  PhilipSeymour Hoffman, so good as the obnoxious foppish wealth playboy inTalented Mr. Ripley, isn't given much to work with, playing a likablecaretaker, like he did in Flawless.  Anderson tries to replicate the form Robert Altman used inNashville of multiple plot lines that come together. But not all ofAnderson's stories are interesting. The story of a brilliant youngrepeat quiz show winner, apparently driven to keep winning to thepoint of not having any other life, is sad but it doesn't have thetragic proportions Anderson seems to suggest. The kid apparently hasbeen a willing participant. Only William H. Macy's portrayal makes youcare about the uninteresting character of a loser former kid quizchamp. Macy's humanity, and rapport with Reilly's cop, even gives someappeal to Magnolia's bizarre frog related climax.     Anderson says Magnolia was inspired by Aimee Mann's songs. Mann'ssoundtrack is one of the best parts of the movie. While the songs andthe film share a sad, pained sensibility, Mann's songs aboutcharacters haunted by their past are over in three minutes and theyhave good melodies to soften their message. Anderson's movie stretchesover more than three hours and its tension and pain are almostunrelenting.",Magnolia,R,1999,2.5

This group aims to operate asjudge, jury and executioner.  The task of stopping them falls to theunlikely candidate of Harry Callahan, an officer who prides himself ontaking out criminals with a flagrant disregard for due process. ""A man's got to know his limitations,"" Harry reflects more than once.  ButHarry doesn't have a lot of limitations, possessing an action hero's abilityto fight overwhelming odds and win.

Well, Harry may not go out of his way lookingfor female companionship, but he sure won't turn it down when it comes sonicely gift wrapped and hand delivered. One of the first crimes that Harry foils in MAGNUM FORCE is an aircrafthijacking.

577,"When the largely aristocratic framers of our Declaration ofIndependence talked about the equality of all Americans, theysure didn't mean economic equality.  Nor would social equality belikely to result from the way things are done in the U.S.  The richare different from the rest of us not only because they have moneybut because they have connections, they have certain socialgraces, they have the ability to move up in their professions moreeasily than we.  Because of the social differences between theclasses, a marriage between a prince and Cinderella is as likelyto come about as a union between Rudy Giuliani and Al Sharpton. There's one exception to the general rule.  In the movies,anything can happen.  In Wayne Wang's Cinderella story, ""Maidin Manhattan,"" filmed without a single scene shot in Vancouver, apolitician known even more for his playboy reputation than hisposition of power falls in love at first sight with a maid.  If such abonding is next to impossible given our system of social classes,how could this occur? Simple.  Have the woman pretend to besomeone else, an Eliza Doolittle transformed to a Hungarianprincess, as it were.  Then reveal identity only after Cupid's arrowshave found their marks.   Scripter Kevin Wade's urban fable of centering on an unlikelyHolly Golightly takes place almost entirely in midtown Manhattanin the vicinity of Grand Central Station, at a first-class hotel whoseregular population includes single mother Marisa Ventura (JenniferLopez).  Marisa is the titled maid in Manhattan, who cleans therooms of an odd and occasionally obnoxious assortment ofguests while looking after her cute and gifted son, Ty (TylerPosey).  Convinced that she will never rise above her station, sheis nevertheless pushed to apply for a management job in the hotelby her best friend and fellow maid, who is fond of getting intomischief.  Dressing up in the expensive threads of a rich andpushy resident, Caroline (Natasha Richardson), Marissa is seenby candidate for the U.S. Senate and man-about town, ChrisMarshall (Ralph Fiennes), who mistakes her for Caroline and feelsan instant connection ironically because he does not consider hera phony.  Though discouraged in his pursuit by his campaignmanager, Jerry Siegel (Stanley Tucci), the politician and theprincess carry out a full-day's courtship, spurred by the film'sShakespearean theme of mistaken identity.  Per the conventionsof romantic comedy, they're kept apart by Marisa's fear ofexposing her occupation and by the campaign manager'sinsistence that his boss stay clear of bad press. ""Maid in Manhattan"" is quite a switch for Wayne Wang, theHong Kong born director named after John Wayne.  Wang wouldbe a more likely candidate for a low-budget indie like the $22,000film ""Chan is Missing"" or the slightly more costly ""Life isCheap...But Toilet Paper is Expensive.""  Yet considering his ""Eata Bowl of Tea,"" Wang does show a flair for examining cross-cultural liaisons and with ""Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart,"" withmother-daughter relationships.  In Wang's exploration of arelationship that transcends social class, ""Maid in Manhattan"" ismerely pleasant enough fare, typically what's called a date movie,though one may wonder why the forty-year-old British actor RalphFiennes, best in much more serious works like ""The EnglishPatient,"" ""Sunshine,"" and ""The End of the Affair,"" got tapped forthe role rather than, say, Ben Affleck.  Kevin Wade's dialogue isshort on wit, the only memorable line occurring when the rich andaggressive Caroline suggests to Chris that they meet once againfor lunch, to which Chris replies, ""A second time would betorture,"" Caroline replies, ""Drinks, then?""  ",Maid In Manhattan,PG-13,2002,2.5

In order to scare B-Rad white, Tom Gibbons(Blair Underwood), Bill's campaign manager and chief spinmeister, hires a coupleof actors, Sean (Taye Diggs) and PJ (Anthony Anderson), to kidnap B-Rad and takehim to the 'hood.  Diggs and Anderson steal every scene that they are in and areeasily the best part of the picture.  With B-Rad not sure what is real and what isn't, he is alternately scared andfull of bravado while in the ghetto.

579,"         MALLRATS is the follow-up to Kevin Smith's acclaimed unrated extravaganza CLERKS and it left me with two prevailing impressions -- this guy's a genius but he's also a sellout. The beauty of his debut film was that it didn't adhere to all the conventions of popular cinema. MALLRATS, on the other hand, is driven by formulaic Hollywood romance rules, even down to the cheesy keyboard music featured in the background during serious dialogue. As far as that aspect of the plot goes, we've been there, done that plenty of times and know exactly what's going to happen ahead of time, but MALLRATS at least partially redeems itself by integrating the worn twentysomething romance theme with Smith's truly unique humor and Tarantinoesque dialogue.          MALLRATS is centered around that pillar of modern American society, the shopping mall, where Generation X'ers with nothing better to do go to hang out. That's how you know it's a movie, because in real life, mall demographics are at least 75% junior high kids sneaking cigarettes and kicking off every sentence with the phrase ""Oh... my... God!"" Here we have slackers like T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brody (Jason Lee) wandering around the mall after being dumped by their girlfriends, who both conveniently turn up at the mall. T.S.' ex, Brandi, was in love with him but was pressured into the breakup by her game show host father. Brody's ex, Renee (Shannen Doherty), broke up with him because all he ever did was read comics and play Sega games.          The plot revolves around the taping of Brandi's dad's game show at the mall (another interesting coincidence) and the sabotage thereof by CLERKS holdovers Jay and Silent Bob. Renee, meanwhile, is being wooed by a mall manager who finds women on the rebound and ""screws them in an uncomfortable place."" (""The backseat of a Volkswagon?"") As with any wacky comedy, though, the plot is secondary to a series of wacky situations, including an assault on the Easter bunny, an appearance by Marvel Comics artist Stan Lee, and a topless fortune teller, along with those Tarantino-inspired dialogues about everything from how Superman could impregnate Lois Lane to Brody's ""smelly palm"" trick. These sequences are original and funny and make the movie worth watching, even if the reliance on a conventional formula to tie it all together ultimately brings the viewing experience down.

Owing quite a lot to 2002's ""Collateral Damage,"" whichhas a very similar premise, the film's one mark of superiority overthe latter is that Vin Diesel (2002's ""XXX"") does a much more convincingjob of emoting loss than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever could.

Alongwith partner Demetrius (Larenz Tate), Sean takes the matter into his own hands.  Tales of revenge are far from a new and original genre, and so inorder for them to be at all fun, they require a down-and-dirty, politicallyincorrect tone that signals all bets are off.

GaryGray (1998's ""The Negotiator"") as if his heart wasn't in the project(understandable, one must admit), ""A Man Apart"" offers up its fairshare of violence and action, but then severely wimps out on its ending.Fortunately, it didn't have much going for it before the lame, twisty closing moments. Filmed before ""XXX"" and having sat on the shelf for over a year, VinDiesel is clearly above the material here. As Sean Vetter, he broodshis way through every scene, constantly smoking and looking angryto show his discontent. After one or two effective moments followingthe discovery that his beloved wife is dead, Diesel is given jarringlylittle of interest to do or say. And when he finally gets his chanceat the end to seek the bloody vengeance he has been breathlessly pursuing,the film recoils into lame ""better-than-thou"" hierarchy. The tired screenplay by Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring is strictlyof the bargain-basement variety, only popping to life when scene-stealerTimothy Olyphant (2003's ""Dreamcatcher"") appears as the smarmy HollywoodJack, a man in cahoots with the drug lord Meno. Olyphant adds morequirky, funny energy to his fleeting moments of screen time than therest of the lead participants do combined.  ""A Man Apart"" is dreary and stripped of any sort of suspense or entertainmentvalue. For Vin Diesel fans, his very appearance may be enough to satetheir appetite, but even they will recognize he is worthy of better.As for those looking for mindless action and excitement, they willbe sorely disappointed by its overall lack of either. ""A Man Apart""is a cheerless affair for pretty much anyone. ","Man Apart, A",R,2003,1.5
581,"In one scene of this literate, witty and ironic film, a strugglingwriter tells an old pro at the game (one who has lost his touch)that his latest manuscript is a no-go.  Why?  The older man,eager to write about the plight of exploited populations, isrecreating the lives of ancient Roman slaves.  Nobody can relateto that.  Use a group exploited in the present day if you wantreaders to identify with the novel, insists his new adviser.  Thesame question can be asked about George Hickenlooper's movie,""The Man From Elysian Fields,"" whose subjects are a novelistwhose first published work is not selling, whose new manuscriptis turned down flat, and who ends up working in tandem with aPulitzer-prize-winning author.  Can the moviegoing public identifywith these characters? Absolutely, because what counts is notwhat they do for a living.  Emotional truths abound.  Considertoday's economy, for example:  what does a married couple do tostay happily together when at the brink of poverty?  What does aloving wife of a successful, much older man do, when her husbandis terminally ill and unable to take her out or to perform some ofthe loving services a young woman should expect of her spouse? What ennobles this project is that the romantic situations are notthe stuff of soap opera but sincerely felt, the ensemble performingin this story act exquisitely, the writing loaded with bon mots andthe plot suffused with ironies and one or two wholly unexpectedsurprises.     Director Hickenlooper (""The Big Brass Ring"") tells his story in asense through the eyes of Luther Fox, whose role is performedagainst type by Mick Jagger.  Luther Fox is the owner of anescort service, the type of place that fills the full-page ads in theYellow Pages, providing companionship and more for lonely, richwomen.  When Fox meets Byron Tiller (Andy Garcia), a writerwhose last novel has been marked down from $25 to $3.95 andstill lies dormant in the remainder bin of a Pasadena bookemporium, he talks him into become a stud-for-hire, suggestingthat the profession will pay enough to maintain his wife, Dena(Julianna Margulies) and son Nathaniel.  His first date proves bothhis salvation and his undoing, as he becomes the regular escort ofAndrea Allcott (Olivia Williams,) wife of a dying, highly-successfulwriter, Tobias Allcott (James Coburn).  By doing so, he raises themoney he needs, becomes both at once a mentor and a studentto Tobias, and puts his own marriage at great risk.      Hickenlooper, using Philip Jayson Lasker's screenplay, tells usquite a bit about the life of a gigolo working for an upscalecompany, such as how the men get the wardrobes they need fornights at the opera, how they see themselves in contrast to thelow-level streetwalkers, what they think of their clients and, evenmore important, what the clients really think of these studs.  Inone telling scene, the wealthy Jennifer Adler (Anjelica Huston),who has been ""dating"" the owner of the company himself, LutherFox (who appropriately is a lonely guy himself), tells him exactlywhat she thinks of his marriage proposal.  A burnt-out case whohas fallen in love with his client, Luther can't get no satisfaction.     The is the sort of quirky, triangulated romance that would appealto an audience of literate people who might be curious about theins and outs of the escort business, who can appreciatecharacters, each with his or own unique qualities.  There are nostereotypes here except perhaps the role inhabited by MichaelDes Barres as Greg, a gray-haired, good-looking fellow whoconsiders his job cynically and has little respect for the womenwho request his services.  The conclusion is ambiguous, as reallife so often is, our hearts going out to the struggling Byron Tillerwho has become sadder and wiser, learning to use his ownemotional reactions to get back into the literary marker.  AndyGarcia is superb, appearing in virtually every scene, in arestrained performance appropriate to a call man who has becomealienated from his calling. ","Man From Elysian Fields, The",R,2002,3
582,"The fourth revenge thriller in as many weeks (following ""Walking Tall,""""The Punisher,"" and ""Kill Bill: Volume Two""), ""Man on Fire"" is thebest of the bunch as it takes a potentially derivative premise andmakes it fresh again. Directed with invigorating style by Tony Scott(2001's ""Spy Game""), the film creates a vivid setting and takes itstime in developing the lead characters and their special bond so thatthe plot turns in the second half have a great deal more weight andurgency to them. Unlike in ""The Punisher,"" where Thomas Jane hypocriticallysought vengeance on John Travolta for something that he himself wasjust as much at fault for, it is completely understandable why DenzelWashington (2003's ""Out of Time"") does what he does and, in his ownto-the-point, take-no-prisoners attitude, is strangely just in thoseextreme actions. Whereas ""The Punisher"" was sadistic, meanspirited,and exploitive for exploitation's sake, ""Man on Fire"" has a distinctheart, soul, and mind.John Creasy (Denzel Washington), once a military man for a top-secretoperation that went wrong, is a broken-down alcoholic on the vergeof suicide when he travels down to Mexico City to visit old war buddyRayburn (Christopher Walken). With Latin America experiencing an epidemicof kidnappings, wealthy married couple Lisa (Radha) and Samuel (MarcAnthony) wish to hire a bodyguard to protect their 9-year-old daughter,Pita (Dakota Fanning), a job Rayburn thinks Creasy would be suitedfor. Creasy accepts, basically because he has nothing better to doin between his Jack Daniels binges, but what starts as just a professionalduty for him gradually turns int o something more. Pita, a smart,precocious aspiring swimmer, works her way under Creasy's skin, andsoon they have become tight pals. For Pita, who sees the sadness inher protector's eyes, it is something similar to a childhood crush.For Creasy, it's something more, as she gets him to see that his lifeis, indeed, worth living.The opening hour of ""Man on Fire"" is deliberately deceptive, necessaryfor the following ninety minutes to have the impact director TonyScott intends. In building up the platonic love story between youngchild Pita and bodyguard Creasy, Scott and screenwriter Brian Helgeland(2003's ""Mystic River"") tread dangerously close to mawkish sentimentality,but avoid such temptations in favor of something that feels authenticand true. It only helps to have two superlative actors in the leadroles. Denzel Washington, in his most focused and poignant turn inrecent memory, and Dakota Fanning (2003's ""Uptown Girls""), hands downthe most astonishing and instinctive child actor working today, exudesuch warm, honest chemistry together that it is impossible not tofeel despair when Pita is abruptly kidnapped and, after a drop-offgone terribly wrong, presumed dead. Creasy, utterly outraged to havePita stolen and possibly killed purely out of someone else's bloodthirstygreed, vows to Lisa that he will make pay everyone even remotely responsiblefor her daughter's kidnapping.""Man on Fire"" was filmed on location in Mexico City, and never, orrarely, before has a country been portrayed in such a boldly negativelight. With the aid of Paul Cameron's (2000's ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"")stark cinematography, Mexico City is viewed as a grimy, violent cesspoolinhabited by crooked cops and vicious criminals. All other citizens,such a s Lisa and Pita, live in constant fear for their safety. DirectorTony Scott does a splendid job of using the rapid-fire, jittery editingand camerawork to throw the viewer off-balance, in a constant stateof unrest as they are thrown into the mind of a man„Creasy„who hasbeen forced over the edge. The way in which Scott employs subtitles,bouncing across the screen even during some of the English-speakingparts, is partially pretentious but nonetheless ingenious, reinforcingthe vitality of the words in question while given the scenes thatextra bit of memorable spark. As stylized and experimental as someof the filmmaking choices are, they only help to darkly personifya foreign setting that, when all is said and done, no viewer in theirright mind would ever want to visit. The end credit dedication, thankingMexico City for being ""a very special place,"" comes off as sarcasticand morbidly funny„a glaring misstep that robs the preceding finalmoments of some of thei r very serious emotional fireworks.Denzel Washington achieves what any great actor does; he wholeheartedlyburrows his way into the body of his character, becoming Creasy asopposed to simply playing him. The depression, the anger, and thenewfound hope suddenly taken from Creasy just when he has gotten itback is all fully realized by Washington, who brings three dimensionsto a role that, in certain instances, is intentionally less rounded.Creasy is a man destroyed by his past who suddenly finds himself letdown again with the present, and Washington's intensity in bringingthis character's predicament to visual fruition is unblemished. WhenPita abruptly vanishes from the screen, the viewer notices, and theblack hole left by her disappearance makes Creasy's actions of revengebrutality all the more justified. Creasy may not be playing by thecountry's written laws, but he is playing by the rules of the thieves,who could bring themselves to kidnapping and torturing children fortheir own financial welfare. For that, what Creasy's payback is worth rooting for.As Pita, 10-year-old Dakota Fanning is a marvel who only becomes morenatural and nuanced with her every film role. Unlike most child actors,even the best of them, whom you can tell are just playing ""make-believe,""Fanning has the maturity and intuition of a performer three or fourtimes her age. She builds Pita from the ground up, taking what ison the page and enriching it with palpable character traits and personaltics. Fanning is charming, yes, but she is also concentrated, unmistakablynatural, and heartbreaking. There is an Academy Award in this actress'future, and it may well come sooner than later if she sticks withparts as good as this one.At almost two-and-a-half hours, ""Man on Fire"" is a long motion picture,perhaps longer than need be for what is essentially a ""point-A-to-point-B""revenge tale, but the time is used wisely and nothing seems extraneous.The opening hour is vital is getting the viewer to care about Creasyand Pita, which makes the second and third acts all the more urgent,discordant, and somber. Such a downbeat tone is needed, however, forthe cathartic conclusion to pay off. ""Man on Fire"" may or may notbe a fully accurate vision of the current environment in Mexico City,but it certainly works to the benefit of a film that is as uncompromisingand plausibly compelling as this one.",Man On Fire,R,2004,2.5
583,"Writer and director Sally Potter (THE TANGO LESSON), who has a propensityfor crafting sumptuous music and visuals while having difficulty coming upwith a compelling narrative, has her usual troubles in THE MAN WHO CRIED.Although it never achieves lift-off, its clich_d story boldly comes outfoursquare against anti-Semitism.  Among its musical treats are melodicopera arias, lip-synced by John Turturro in a silly beard, and a moodyrendition of ""Gloomy Sunday,"" lip-synced by Christina Ricci.  Thesuperlative actors also include Cate Blanchett as a blonde bimbo, whoworries that she hasn't used enough bleach on her hair, and Johnny Depp, whorepeats his role from CHOCOLAT as a gypsy hunk living in France. As the story begins in an unknown time and place, Yiddish-speakingcharacters are fleeing a village.  One young girl, played by ClaudiaLander-Duke, is sent off to America but arrives instead in Britain, wherethe immigration officials randomly assign her the name of Susan.  Susan, whotakes the nickname of Suzie, is caned at school by her principal forspeaking Yiddish.  The principal remarks that they didn't let him speakWelsh when he was young. Jumping forward in time to pre-World War II Britain, a grown-up Suzie(played by a miscast Ricci) embarks on a new career as a member of ascantily-clad group of singers and dancers bound for Paris.  With alaughably overdrawn Russian accent, Cate Blanchett plays Lola, Suzie'sroommate in her new troupe.  When they arrive in Paris, Lola takes up withDante (Turturro), an Italian opera singer with a large ego.  After workinghard, albeit with mixed success, on making the accents authentic, Pottergives up on only one nationality, the Germans.  The only characters withAmerican accents are the Nazis.  Go figure.   Since we've seen all of this before, the only things we're likely toremember are the visuals.  Two stand out.  Depp makes one heck of a handsomegypsy, and Turturro looks ridiculous as an opera singer.   THE MAN WHO CRIED runs a long 1:37.

584,"One of the riskiest and hardest moves in any actor's careeris transition from the image of popular entertainer to theimage of true artist. Mel Gibson saw that in early 1990s,when he tried to reach beyond his status of actionsuperstar, shown in MAD MAX and LETHAL WEAPON movies. Hisfirst attempt, role in Zeffirelli's HAMLET, endeddisastrously. Luckily, there was a second chance for him,and in 1993 he took that chance with THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE,coming-of-age drama based on the novel by Isabelle Holland.That film was also his directorial debut that laid the paththat would lead to his BRAVEHEART triumph two years later.  Like his colleague Jodie Foster in LITTLE MAN TATE, Gibsondecided to direct a movie with a young boy as protagonist.The plot takes place in small town in Maine 1968. ChuckNorstadt (played by Nick Stahl) is a 12-year old boy wholives together with his mother (played by Margaret Whitton)and two half-sisters. Being misunderstood and ignored by hisfamily, he seeks rebellion in the idolatry of his latefather, military pilot. His great ambition in life is to goto the military boarding school. That move, at the peak ofanti-war movement, isn't just unpopular - it is veryunlikely, because Chuck needs tutoring. Help comes in a formof Justin McLeod (played by Mel Gibson), former teacher witha terribly scarred face, who lives a hermit. McLeod beginsteaching Norstadt and two of them become friends.Unfortunately, that only enflames the hostility of the town,and vicious rumours about teacher's dark past emerge,threatening the relationship between Chuck and McLeod.  At first glance, THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE looks surprisinglygood for someone's directorial debut. But, those who arelikely to nitpick Gibson's work would find that thedirecting seems somewhat too baroque for a simple drama thatwould be most suitable for TV films. The most attractiveelement in this film is acting. Gibson plays very good andthankful role of a misanthropic hermit who gradually regainslove for humanity. That role was very carefully played, inorder not to overshadow anyone else, including Nick Stahl,who was good in his part. The result is a well-acted,competently directed coming-of-age drama that doesn't drownsitself in cliches and cheap sentimentality.  Unfortunately, the screenplay by Malcolm McRury had touchedthe issues of homosexuality and paedophilia, and that wasenough for this film to be criticised not for its own flaws,but for the shortcomings of its director. Before making thisfilm, Gibson was branded as homophobic, because of aninterview he had given. In the peak of PoliticalCorrectness, it was simply inconceivable arrogance for anotorious homophobe to direct a movie dealing with suchissues. But the real reason why some left-leaning criticsattacked the film wasn't in Gibson's treatment ofhomosexuality (which wasn't mentioned or implied on untilthe very last scenes in the film). It was the fact thatGibson gave a story about anti-establishment rebellion froma rather conservative point of view. The film is set in1968, but the thing that bothers Chuck is not the oldestablishment; Chuck is disgusted with the new socialfreedoms that are enjoyed at the expense of newergenerations (with Chuck's own family being the victim ofendless divorces), and the character of Carl (played byRichard Masur), Chuck's potential stepfather, could be seenas the caricature of Baby Boomers and all their ideals. Thesubtlety with which the conservative ideas were introducedin this Hollywood film didn't hurt the film, but the veryfact such ideas found their place on screen in thatultra-liberal era was enough to make this film better thanits reputation. ",Man Without A Face,PG-13,1993,2
585," Alexandre Dumas, the novelist who wrote 'The Three Musketeers' in the19th century would be spinning in his grave if he knew that the onlyFrenchman in 1998's 'The Man in the Iron Mask' would have the weakestrole.  Also written in the 19th century by Dumas, 'The Man in the IronMask' was put into print after 'The Three Musketeers' and it, along with'The Three Musketeers', actually contains four heroes: Athos, Porthos,Aramis and D'Artagnan.  They are portrayed in this version of 'The Manin the Iron Mask' by John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, Jeremy Irons andGabriel Byrne.  Set in 1662, their King, Louis XIV of France (LeonardoDiCaprio), is a tyrant, watching his people starve while he lives in theseductive life of luxury, and is a true law unto himself.  There have been many versions of both 'The Three Musketeers' and 'TheMan in the Iron Mask' produced for film and television and this one hasto ranks in the much lower half of all that has been accomplished.  The musketeers are defenders of the French crown, a high powered army ofloyal soldiers who possess a talent to wield a sword better than anyoneto protect their sovereign ruler.  D'Artagnan (Byrne), is the most loyaland says he will not betray his King, no matter how ruthless his methodsare, somehow hoping his majesty will become a better man.  Athos,Porthos and Aramis are past their prime and have retired to a more quietlife and decide to replace the King with his twin brother, the man inthe iron mask who the King perceives as a threat to his power. They aremotivated to overthrow the King when one of them is unknowingly deemedto be a suspicious traitor to the crown.  Leonardo DiCaprio and the rest of the cast are convincing in theirroles, despite speaking English and containing no French accentswhatsoever, except for Depardieu, but his role is the weakest and mostclownish in the film.  Malkovich is miscast as he was in the 1988 periodpiece 'Dangerous Liaisons' and why an Englishman, complete with anaccent to boot (Irons) would be asked to play in this is a mystery.  Buttheir professional dedication to their roles make it work and DiCapriois believable as both the King and his more decent twin.  The real problem with the film is that by concentrating solely on thedramatic set-up of the first 90 minutes or so, the finished product, ata little over two hours, comes off as relatively lifeless and ratherstiffly written instead of sophisticated and high brow, as it shouldbe.  Written and directed by Randall Wallace who wrote director MelGibson's 1995 Oscar winner 'Braveheart', Wallace shows he has no talentas a director and his attention to detail is pretty superficial.  Thecostumes in 'The Man in the Iron Mask' are noticeably ""costume shop"" intheir appearance and the art direction and sets are perhaps the onlysaving grace, technically.  Teenage girls are sure to enjoy watching DiCaprio in his first rolesince 'Titanic' but one misfired scene has DiCaprio standing still in aroom with his long hair, and some of it is draped over his face and withhis attire, it just looks too feminine.  I was imagining ear rings onhim at that moment and it actually seemed funny.  Something that I'msure wasn't intended and it shouldn't have been allowed to happen.DiCaprio's hair in many scenes with his female companions actually lookslonger than theirs does.  Perhaps appropriate, but it just seems thatsomeone should have reminded director Randall Wallace that the film isset in the 1660's and not the 1960's.  Peace. ","Man in the Iron Mask, The",PG-13,1998,2
586,"   Don't miss the beginning - it's the most imaginative andhilarious part. Facing the camera, Jim Carrey establishes immediatelythat he's completely captured the eye-bulging essence of the latecomedian Andy Kaufman. His impersonation is nothing short ofbrilliant, even Oscar-worthy. That having been acknowledged, the movieitself leaves a lot to be desired. First, it's not really amovie. It's simply the embodiment of an objectionable character whompeople either adored or loathed. Director Milos Foreman andscreenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, the trio who didThe People vs. Larry Flynt, don't attempt an analysis or even offerpsychological insight into the complex, enigmatic nature of thisdefinitely unhinged, obviously neurotic, and perhaps psychoticperformer. Instead, we simply watch his progress from comedy clubs,like the Improv, to Saturday Night Live, to TV's Taxi along with hisrelentless self-destruction, aided and abetted by his writer/sidekickBob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). Danny DeVito's superb as his agent,observing: ""You're insane - but you might also be brilliant."" Kaufmanmeets his girlfriend (Courtney Love) in a wrestling challenge but shetoo is a cipher.

587," Susan Granger's review of ""MANSFIELD PARK"" (Miramax Films)  In this provocative, revisionist adaptation of Jane Austen'sthird novel, Canadian writer-director Patricia Rozema gives her 19thcentury heroine, Fanny Price, much of Austen's own confidant, creativepersonality.  Incorporating material from Austen's early journals andletters, Rozema recreates Fanny (Frances O'Connor) as a poor relationwho is sent from Portsmouth to the magnificent mansion calledMansfield Park to live in emotional exile with her pompous uncle,starchy aunts, and privileged cousins. Her favorite cousin is thebrooding Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) who is destined to be a humbleclergyman, much to the chagrin of the outspoken, ambitious young woman(Embeth Davidtz) who wants to marry him. Always made to feel inferiorwithin the genteel, rigidly conventional British class system, she isconsidered more than a servant but less than an equalcompanion. Nevertheless, meek Fanny becomes an adept and witty writerwho is courted by a charming, handsome rake (Allesandro Nivola) whomshe does not trust. Australian actress Frances O'Connor does asplendid job as the plucky heroine and her complex performance ismatched by playwright Harold Pinter, as her autocratic uncle, andLindsay Duncan in dual roles - as both Fanny's desperate, impoverishedmother and wealthy, opium-addicted aunt. Admittedly, Patricia Rozema'sscript tackles too many social issues, including the dark brutality ofslavery on the Caribbean island of Antigua, an exploitive endeavorwhich supports this segment of England's landed gentry. And Rozema'swillfully manipulative, pro-feminist characters seem far ahead oftheir time. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Mansfield Park is asensual, cinematic 7.  It's a period drama that should appeal,primarily, to the art-house crowd. ",Mansfield Park,R,1999,3.5
588,"I will be the first to admit ""Marci X"" has its share of problemsthecharacterizations are spotty and too often oversimplified, while theuneven scene transitions signal post-production tinkeringbut thereis no excuse for how Paramount Pictures has handled its release. Comingout at the end of August with a nearly nonexistent marketing campaign(along with the beginning of January, this is the weekend studiosrelease projects they have no faith in), the picture was not screenedfor critics and its poster might as well have been shipped to everytheater across the U.S. with ""destined to be a box-office dud"" spray-paintedon them. Walking into ""Marci X,"" audience members would have to liveunder rocks to expect anything other than a total failure. Walkingout of ""Marci X,"" I would dare anyone to honestly say that, yes, itwas just as creatively bankrupt as they had expected. Marci Feld (Lisa Kurdrow) is the pampered grown daughter of Ben Feld(Richard Benjamin), the mega-wealthy owner of a record label who hasjust come under fire by Senator Mary Ellen Spinkle (Christine Baranski)for releasing the latest album of raunchy rapper Dr. $ (Damon Wayans).When Ben suddenly takes ill and his company is threatened with bankruptcy,Marci decides to take it upon herself to persuade Dr. $ to make anofficial statement apologizing for his songs' lyrics and, thus, savingthe record label. The results of such are not quite as Marci expects,especially after she finds herself falling in love with the misunde rstood rapper. An unexpectedly sharp-nailed satire about the distinct barrier betweenraces, as well as the media's and politician's role in censorship,""Marci X"" garners occasional big laughs from just how far it willgo in making these statements. The screenplay's comedy, by Paul Rudnick(2000's ""Isn't She Great?""), is fast and witty and biting, landingjust on the good side of bad taste. In one uproarious moment, Marcihosts a benefit for children who have lost all feeling in their arms,a very real affliction that is more than proven when two kids on displayare poked with forks. In another scene, Dr. $ skews a public serviceannouncement he is talked into doing with clearly gay boy band, ""BoysR Us,"" in a most clever way. Additionally, Marci's impromptu rap abouther purse at a Dr. $ concertset to the beat of Madonna's ""Vogue""isten times as entertaining and creative as Eminem's similar sc ene in 2002's ""8 Mile."" Since her superlative, Oscar-worthy performance in 1998's ""The Oppositeof Sex,"" strong feature film work has eluded ""Friends"" actress LisaKudrow (1999's ""Analyze This,"" 2000's ""Lucky Numbers,"" 2002's ""AnalyzeThat""). Too often wasted on the big screen, Kudrow has finally beengiven a lead role that amicably showcases her talents both as a comedianand a serious actress. As Marci, who learns that there is more tolife than clinging to the heels of her father, Kudrow is spunky, likable,andin one particular scene she plays with disheveled hair and no make-upexcept smeared mascarahas never been more beautiful. More surprising, however, is the actual chemistry she shares withDamon Wayans (2000's ""Bamboozled""). An odd-couple pairing if thereever was one, but Wayans sells it by playing Dr. $ as a hardcore rapperwith a heart of gold who takes a liking to Marci's inner funk. Allof their scenes together feel genuine rather than pre-fabricated.Unfortunately, it is their relationship that seems to have taken thehardest hit with the cutting room floor when it should have been thecenterpiece. In a welcome supporting role, Christine Baranski (2002's""Chicago"") is a comic delight in her portrayal of a stuck-up right-wingsenator who refuses to admit she likes Dr. $'s musical stylings. No matter what its detractors may think, ""Marci X"" is a good film,and one that could have been great had director Richard Benjamin takenhis satirical targets a little further and allowed his charactersmore space to develop and breathe. There is something of a missedopportunity in ""Marci X"" since the comedy that does work is original,zippy, and ballsy. At the same time, the movie is funny, and thisis Lisa Kudrow's strongest feature work in five years. After all,there is more to Kudrowand ""Marci X"" proves itthan Phoebe Buffay.",Marci X,R,2003,2.5

She takes off with afew other young women, at least one of whom gets caught whileanother, after suffering the breakage of one of the latex glovesenveloping the drugs, dies and has her stomach cut open by theNew Jersey motel contact. ""Maria"" is filmed by Jim Denault in and around an Ecuadoriantown south of Quito, with some lush photography showing up themountainous beauty of that small country. The concludingsegments take place in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York,where Maria's lies get her set up in the home of the sister of oneof these mules. The picture holds some striking, deliberately underplayedperformances from the lead, Ms. Sandino and a nice job by non-professional actor Yenny Paola Vega as her rotund friendBlanca_who is even more lost in New York than Maria andfollows her around like a homeless Chihuahua.  What we come away with is an appreciation of life in the UnitedStates or, for that matter a distaste for a Third World countrywhose natural beauty belies its horrendous standard of living forperhaps a majority of the rural population.  Impressive though it may be, ""Maria Full of Grace"" cannot beconsidered in the same breath as the classic study of poverty-stricken Latin Americans who come to the U.S. for a betterstandard of living, Gregory Nava's monumental ""El Norte""_asweeping saga of a brother and sister who leave their violence-torn village in Guatemala to find a better life in The North. What itlacks in humor and complexity, however, is made up for in itsauthentic performances and the exposition to naive Americanslike me of a culture of poverty and the desperate attempts bysome people living therein to find a better way.",Maria Full Of Grace,R,2004,3.5
590,"      Although MARY REILLY is being billed as a remake of the Dr. Jekylland Mr. Hyde story, I believe it is actually a remake of MY FAIR LADY.Off screen we have the director (Stephen Frears) playing the ProfessorHiggins role and the producers (Norma Heyman, Nancy Graham Tanen, andNed Tanen) playing Colonel Pickering.  I can easily imagine ProfessorHiggins bolding proclaiming that he could take a famous story full ofaction and imagination, populate it with megastars, turn it into acolossal bore and yet so stun the audience with his audacity that noone would leave.  Everyone would know the story and the stars so theywould wait until the last moment to realize that he had transformed aprince of a movie into a guttersnipe and that nothing of interest wasever going to happen in the film.  As the audience leaves dazed andbewildered, Colonel Pickering must have been singing, ""You've done it,you've done it, I can't believe you've done it.""       The MARY REILLY on the screen is a remake of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde told from the view of a maid named Mary Reilly (Julia Roberts).The brilliant actor John Malkovich is Dr. Jekyll as well as his alterego Mr. Hyde.  The only other important part in the movie is GlennClose badly miscast as the madam of the local bordello where Mr. Hydegets into trouble.  The movie starts off promisingly enough withrealistic gas and candle lit photography (Philippe Rousselot).  This,however, rapidly degenerates into a movie so dark and with such lowcontrast that your eyes, when you can keep them awake, will literallyhurt from squinting so much trying to make out the action, or usuallylack thereof, on the screen.  The movie is filmed in Edinburgh, but itis so dark, you'd never know it.       At the thirty minute point, almost nothing had happened save anineffective flashback to an abusive period in Mary's childhood.  Mostof the time, during this and all parts of the movie, is devoted toatmospheric scenes of one cast member or another slowly walking throughrooms where little happens.  It is hard to believe that this movieshares the same lineage with the numerous other Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hydepictures.       The screenwriter (Christopher Hampton) is at a loss at how toengage the audience.  In a failed attempt to solve this problem hecomes up with lots of gratuitous violence and major amounts of humanand animal blood.  In a typical scene, there is a disemboweled ratlaying on a bed in a room with blood splattered everywhere.  Inanother, we have a medical operation complete with hacksaw.  Actually,my distaste for the movie comes not from disliking these scenes, butfrom being put to sleep by the boredom of the show.       In the more minor complain department, when Dr. Jekyll becomes Mr.Hyde, I did not buy his short curly hair getting longer and straightand his goatee disappearing, and I certainly did not buy thetransformation scene lifted straight out of ALIEN.  For some reason Dr.Jekyll looks a lot like Ethan Hawke in BEFORE SUNRISE.  In ChristopherHampton's MARY REILLY, Dr. Jekyll is a meek and melancholic man, andMr. Hyde is a handsome and self-assured playboy.  Sure.  The sparsesets (Stuart Craig) provided nothing of visual interest to engage theviewer.       The acting by the three great stars is an embarrassment.  GlennClose has no idea of what to do with her role and plays it like astone.  Julia Roberts seems to think that so long as she is made up toappear unattractive, and she grimaces a lot, she has achieved greatart.  Last, and certainly least, is John Malkovich's disappointingperformance.  I would list him close to the top of the best actorsworking today.  In good shows and bad, I have been nothing less than inawe of his work until now.  Somehow, Professor Higgins, I mean StephenFrears manages to get an uninteresting performance out of Malkovich.This is a miracle I did not think possible. ",Mary Reilly,R,1996,0.5
591,"When President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his address to the Daughters of the American Revolution, he began, ""Fellow immigrants"" to the shock of the good ladies in his audience. The D.A.R., erroneously considering themselves the real, native Americans, were just one group that warned against the acceptance of new people from abroad with different values from theirs, but even less conservative groups have from time to time discriminated against newcomers from outside Northern Europe.  The most recent example of trouble is the dislike that some Americans appropriate against Arab-Americans, given the recent events of 9/11 and, in the light of the taking of American hostages by Iranian terrorists in 1979, Iranian-Americans did not fare well either. ""Maryam"" is the story of one Iranian-American girl who, though living in New Jersey for most of her life was directly affected just after the ouster of the Shah in Teheran and the 1979 standoff between the Ayatollah's anti-American government and our own country.      Presented with considerable humor to further punctuate its political resonance, writer-director Ramin Serry's well-paced and sprightly-acted movie has contemporary resonance despite its coverage of events that occurred twenty-three years ago. Just as the hostility of some Americans toward Muslims and Arabs living in the U.S. seems to have died down months after the destruction of the World Trade Center,  the anger of some of our countrymen toward Iranians in '79 dissipated when hostages were released. While the most poignant scenes from ""Maryam"" deal with the way an assimilated Iranian family becomes the target of clashes during the hostage crisis, the core of the story is the relationship between the title character (Mariam Parris) and her cousin Ali (David Ackert) who had arrived on a student visa from Iran.  The cultural dissonance becomes obvious from the first moments as Maryam, about to give a welcoming embrace to Ali, is shunned by the religious Muslim who refuses even to shake hands with a woman.  As Ali, who is taken in by his uncle, Dr. Armin (Shaun Toub), settles into his new and unfamiliar quarters with Maryam's father and mother (Shohreh Aghdashloo), the dissonance between the two cultures increases incrementally.  As Ali shows his disgust, first at the easygoing relationships between the boys and girls in Maryam's high school and later at the demonstrations against the Ayatollah's government, a family secret emerges that threatens the uneasy truce among the Armin family members but has political repurcussions as well.      To the credit of Ramin Serr in his debut feature as a filmmaker with ""Maryam,"" the characters are not plot devices, each representing a single point of view.  Dr. Armin, for example, comes across as a secular, Americanized doctor who even gives his daughter the keys to a car, but at the same time is overly protective of her to the extent of forbidding her to go to parties or even dating.  While Ali's heart remains with the fundamentalist regime in his home country, his English is good and he appears at times almost to be embracing the hang-loose style he sees displayed around him by his hip countryman Reza (comedian Maz Jobrani).    From time to time he cracks a winning smile and we expect him almost to chuck his uptight bringing, even to the point of flirting with his cousin, Maryam.       Serry seamlessly weaves in some actual news clippings of the time, including one of Jimmy Carter sharing a drink with the Shah and of the Ayatollah blessing the throngs of citizens joyfully expressing their satisfaction with change of government. Politics takes a backstage to the personal story of a teenager, winningly played by Mariam Parris, itching to blossom into her first romance with a classmate named Jamie (Victory Jory) while learning something new and shocking about her father news which draws her closer to her overwrought cousin, Ali.  ",Maryam,NR,2000,3
592," Three 30-year-old friends' search for their rightful place in life is the subject of director Linda Kandel's independent drama, ""Mascara,"" an intelligently-written, if somewhat familiar, right-of-passage film. Movies about a group of young women and their exploits concerning love, career, and identity are a dime a dozen, and even if ""Mascara"" isn't one of the very best of the genre, it is also far from one of the worst, due to the apt way in which the characters are dealt with and developed.  Moving back and forth between the three women's plights, the film begins with a stylishly-edited sequence in which one of them, Laura (Lumi Cavazos), is about to get married to her beau, Donnie (Steve Schub). Laura is apprehensive and nervous, as many brides-to-be understandably are, but seven months later, we discover that Donnie has begun to cheat on her, and being the resolute woman that she is, Laura packs up and leaves him, moving back in with her possessive parents. Meanwhile, Jennifer (Amanda de Cadenet) is having troubles of her own. It seems that when her own husband was caught having a one-time affair, she let it slide but found herself emotionally dead inside. Together, they have a sweet, young daughter, but Jennifer begins to stray down a promiscuous path of her own, desperately attempting to find happiness with a collection of one-night-stands and alcohol. And Rebecca (Ione Skye), who moves from one job to the next, preferring to not stay at one place too long, has picked up with Nick (Steve Jones), an older man with two children: Daphne (Tara Subkoff), a slutty teenager whom Nick seems just a tad too infatuated with, and Andrew (Corey Page), a college student who is rarely at home and, thus, when Rebecca begins a relationship with him as well, she doesn't know he is Nick's son.  The title, ""Mascara,"" I think, has less to do with the make-up than as a metaphor for the three women's struggles for independence and satisfaction. All three of the central characters are vividly drawn and interesting people. Laura may seem the most grounded at first, but then we discover that her job as a psychotherapist is overshadowed by a scene when we find she has a therapist of her own. As far as her husband Donnie goes, she still loves him, but it is clear that he is not a responsible man, as he casually has affairs and doesn't show any sympathy for Laura. Rebecca, on the other hand, finds her rapid change of jobs a nice change of pace, even though she later discovers after an acting audition that she unknowingly has a great deal of talent. Slowly, she starts to suspect that something other than fatherly love is going on between Nick and his daughter, and quickly drops him when things get a little too uncomfortable. Poor Jennifer has the most problems, as she finds it difficult to show any feeling for anyone. Even though Ken had one affair, he is honestly regretful of his misstep and is otherwise faithful, unlike Donnie. Jennifer loves her daughter, no doubt about that, but her own interior problems need to be worked out, and so she leaves them. It doesn't take long to see that she is headed for further conflicts.  Ione Skye was such a startlingly bright presence in 1989's ""Say Anything,"" but since then hasn't had much success, aside from her turn in 1992's indie, ""Gas, Food Lodging."" Skye returns with a reckoning here, as her character of Rebecca also has to deal with the discovery from her aunt (Karen Black) that her father is not dead, like she had been told, but merely wanted nothing to do with her when he found out her mother was pregnant. In one of the best scenes in the film, Rebecca pays a visit to her dad, who works as an auto mechanic. He takes her for a test drive in a used car, but she decides not to reveal her identity. Skye is so notably assured and winning here that it is unfortunate this film was released earlier this summer from Phaedra Cinema, but through ill-fated circumstances, was not reviewed in any of the NY newspapers and therefore opened and closed with the blink of an eye. Be sure to catch the film when it comes to video probably later this year.  Lumi Cavazos, as Laura, appeared in 1993's acclaimed foreign film, ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" which remains unseen by me, but after seeing her here, I might just have a reason to take a look at that earlier picture. Cavazos is luminous and is even a little funny when dealing with her character's eccentricities (when she goes out on a date and lights a cigarette but simply holds it in her hand, she tells him, ""I don't smoke"").  Amanda de Cadenet decidedly has the most difficult role, and goes through the most changes, but is up to the challenge, believably displaying a wide range of emotions as a woman who doesn't feel wanted by anyway, most of all her husband, despite his constant apologizing for what he once did. One late sequence, however, in which Jennifer goes home with the wrong man, who then violently rapes her, felt out-of-place and nothing comes of the scene afterwards. Its purpose, of course, was to be an incident that finally knocks some sense into her concerning her impending path of destruction, but the scene still could have been more well-handled.  There actually aren't that many actual criticisms I can give the film, other than to say that this sort of story has been overdone and the film world wasn't exactly crying out for another one. I also could have done without the ending, which is just a little too neat and tidy for my taste, but that at least put me in a better mood than if it had ended on a downbeat note. Still, these minor downfalls don't detract away from my overall feelings on ""Mascara,"" which is that it is a rare mature film about free-thinking adults, and one that treats its characters with an open mind and a big heart. ",Mascara,R,1999,3
593,"Former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Dana Carvey's first leadappearance in a motion picture in eight years (1994's ""Trapped inParadise"" was his last) has the untimely distinction of being releasedjust one week after ""Wayne's World"" co-star Mike Myers' return inthe hugely popular ""Austin Powers in Goldmember."" Now, ""Goldmember""isn't going to win any awards come next March, but its slim shot looksprogressively bright in comparison to the abysmally unfunny ""The Masterof Disguise."" There is nothing worse in the comedy genre than a filmthat doesn't carry a single inspired moment of humor, unless it isa film that doesn't carry a single inspired moment. Period. ""The Masterof Disguise"" has obtained such a feat. If a movie wants you to laugh but for no other reason than the oddballname of the lead character, you should know what you're getting yourselfinto. Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) is a bumbling waiter workingat his parent's Italian restaurant with a tendency of uncontrollablymimicking, and offending, the customers. When his loving mom (EdieMcClurg) and dad (James Brolin) are ruthlessly kidnapped, Pistachio'slong-lost grandfather (Harold Gould) swoops in to expose a deep, darksecret his parents have kept from him since birth: the Disguisey ancestryis of a long line of special agents with a knack for disguising themselvesas anything and anyone. After a period of training, Pistachio acquiresan assistant in the form of lovely single mother Jennifer (JenniferEsposito), and sets out to find his parents and save the day. ""The Master of Disguise"" fails to work on any level, most of all inthe laugh department. Cobbled together by screenwriters Dana Carveyand Harris Goldberg and amateurishly directed by Perry Andelin Blake,the movie is weakly held together by just enough plotting to makethe proceedings comprehensible. Mostly, though, it is a train wreckbarrage of recycled spoofs and head-scratchingly random jokes thatwill go over the heads of the kids in the audience, and leave theadults stonefaced. ""The Exorcist,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""Serpico"" all haveembarrassing send-ups, as does a woeful gag involving Madonna's ""PapaDon't Preach"" that was orchestrated in the exact same fashion in 2001's ""Sugar & Spice."" At the very thought of comedian Dana Carvey dressing up in differentcostumes and impersonating various people and things, one may suspectthat some entertainment value is surely to be had. Those unsuspectingpotential viewers would be wrong. Carvey has been good in the past(Garth in ""Wayne's World"" springs immediately to mind), but he isunctuous for every moment he is onscreen here, and has seemingly losteven a rudimentary understanding of successful comic timing. In asorry bid to appeal to all ages that resembles grasping at straws,Carvey has ended up with a motion picture that will likely please no one. Brent Spiner (2001's ""I Am Sam"" and TV's ""Star Trek""), as arch villainDevlin Bowman; James Brolin (2000's ""Traffic""), as Pistachio's father;and Edie McClurg (2001's ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder""), as Pistachio'smother, are respected actors whose appearances mark a low point ineach of their careers. Third-rate cameos by Jesse Ventura, Jesse Johnson,Bo Derek, and Jessica Simpson are just as inexplicable. If there isa person that barely manages to work their way out of the rubble,it is the radiant Jennifer Esposito (2001's ""Don't Say a Word""), asPistachio's love interest and assistant. Esposito is so far abovethe insulting material she has to work with that she might as wellhave filmed her scenes in space. There is something to be said about the Hollywood film industry whena movie as desperately inane as ""The Master of Disguise"" comes along.Dana Carvey and his cohorts may have meant well, but only a humanvegetable could have possibly viewed the final cut and not have hadany vocal concerns about the submerged level of quality on display.""The Master of Disguise"" ultimately wouldn't have passed muster asa two-minute skit on ""Saturday Night Live."" As a scant (but stilldrug-out) 76-minute feature, it is downright insufferable.","Master Of Disguise, The",PG,2002,0.5
594,"Up until its final ten minutes, ""Matchstick Men,"" directed by RidleyScott (2001's ""Black Hawk Down""), is a beautifully crafted motionpicture filled with endearing, sharply drawn characters and an ultra-smart,non-flashy screenplay. Whereas most films about con men are all aboutstyle, tricks and with no real substance, screenwriters Nicholas Griffinand Ted Griffin (2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"") invigorate the genre bywisely making it a character-driven piece about relationships thatjust so happens to be set in the world of cons. For close to 110 minutes,we grow to care about and love the people we have met and spent timewith. And then, with no warning, the rug is thrown out from underus to make way for one of the most unnecessary, enraging, condescendingendings in recent memory.   Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage) is an obsessive compulsive con man withagoraphobic symptoms who works alongside protege Frank Mercer (SamRockwell) as they meticulously wheel and deal people into giving themmoney. Filled with unwanted tics and fears, Roy goes to see a psychiatristabout refilling a subscription for his illness and ends up openingup to him about his past. Through this, he learns of his estranged14-year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman), whom he has never metbut who wants to get to know him. With summer break in full swing,Angela practically moves in with Roy and falls in love with the fathershe never had. Eventually, Roy is grudgingly teaching Angela the tricksof his trade as he and Frank start work on their next con.   First and foremost, ""Matchstick Men"" is a wonder of brilliant leadperformances, each one breathing distinctive life into their freshroles. Coming off his Oscar-nominated role in 2002's best film, ""Adaptation,""Nicolas Cage is note-perfect as Roy Waller, faithfully gracing himwith all the physical tics and personal flaws that afflict him. WhenRoy discovers the joy of being a parent, he yearns to move out ofthe con business but isn't sure how. Cage is at the top of his gamein every scene, garnering big laughs when they are called for andan emotional depth and originality of character one rarely sees in mainstream Hollywood.   Matching him every step of the way is 23-year-old Alison Lohman (2002's""White Oleander""), who is called up to play someone almost ten yearsyounger than she and, amazingly, makes it completely believable. Withthe looks, speech, and mannerisms of a young teenager wise beyondher years but with an inexperienced naivete underneath the surface,Lohman hits her role of Angela squarely on the head and makes it herown. Having only one other major lead role under her belt, Lohmaneasily cements herself as one of the most versatile and talented youngactresses working today.   The father-daughter relationship between Roy and Angela, looselyrecalling the one between Ryan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal in 1973's ""PaperMoon,"" is the heart and soul of ""Matchstick Men."" In the ways thatRoy and Angela relate to one another, first with a yearning hesitancyand then with an unmistakable casualness, and in the way that Royoccasionally loses his temper and says things to Angela without meaningthem, this is one of the more lovely cinematic parent-child depictionsin quite some time.   Filling out the lead trio, Sam Rockwell (2001's ""Heist"") exudes thesame quirky coolness he is getting to be known for as Frank Mercer.Frank does not have as much screentime as Cage or Lohman, but in theway he looks up to Roy while at the same time having to act as hisguiding light through Roy's rough patches, he is an indelible characterwho makes his every moment count. If the sign of a charismatic actoris their ability to brighten every scene in which they appear, thenRockwell has this gift in spades.   Had ""Matchstick Men"" followed on the same course it had set up throughits climax, then it would undoubtedly be one of the stronger motionpictures of 2003. Unfortunately, director Ridley Scott betrays hisaudience and the time they have invested in this story for no apparentreason other than to offer a surprising twist ending. It cannot bedenied that the concluding ten minutes are, indeed, unexpected, butthey are also gimmick-ridden and ludicrous, putting a severe damperon everything that has come before. The characters, as well as theviewers, are not treated with the respect they deserve, and we instantlystop caring because of it.   As wonderful as the vast majority of ""Matchstick Men"" is, it is justas abysmal in its cumulative effect, transforming an innovative, heartfelt,purely human tale into one that is as shallow as every con film thathas come before it. For the sheer promise it held for so long, andits jarring plunge into maddening mediocrity by the end credits roll,""Matchstick Men"" may just rank as the most disappointing film of the year. ",Matchstick Men,PG-13,2003,3
595,"One of the great novelists of children's books is Roald Dahl.This Spring we got to see an animated movie of his JAMES AND THE GIANTPEACH and loved it.  We had a friend who leant us the book, and Jeffrey(age 7) and I spent many a wonderful night this summer reading it.With that in mind, we looked forward to a new movie, MATILDA, based onanother of Dahl's books.  MATILDA is a live action film with Danny DeVito as the producer,director, and one of the stars.  Between the two recent Dahl movies, itwould be hard to pick my favorite.  Finally, I should point out thatthe best movie ever made from a Dahl book has to be 1971's WILLY WONKAAND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.  I think I have seen that movie at least ahalf dozen times.  I've got to write a review of it someday.  In MATILDA, Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is born to the worstparents imaginable.  On the way out of the hospital, father andfraudulent used car salesman Harry (Danny DeVito) says of the hospitalbill, ""five thousand dollars!  I'm not going to pay it.  What are theygoing to do?  Repossess the child?""  Since her father and her mother Zinnia (Rhea Perlman) leave her athome all day from age four on, she becomes independent and anexceptional reader.  Having only newspapers and magazines to read, shedares one night to interrupt the family's nightly rendezvous with theirbeloved television to ask a favor.  She asks her father for a book, andastonished, he demands, ""A book.  Why do you want a book?""  She meeklyanswers, ""to read,"" He sets her straight with, ""there's nothing you canget from a book that you can't get from a television faster.""  Although the book interchange is extremely funny, I reflected onthe fact that libraries are reducing their hours at the same time thatthe average family spends something like three to four hours a daywatching television so people's actions are closer to Harry's thanMatilda's.  Her father is the boss.  When he gives her orders, he ridiculesher with, ""I'm smart; you're dumb.  I'm big; you're little.  Andthere's nothing you can do about it.""  Soon she strikes back.  She putssuper super glue on his hat so it will stick to his head and generallymakes his life miserable.  Dahl is not your sweetness and light author.His characters have to learn to survive in a hostile world, and they doit with style, imagination, and cunning.  Matilda gets sent to a school run by principal Agatha Trunchbull(Pam Ferris).  Trunchbull is a classic villain.  She looks, dresses,and walks like a Nazi commandant.  The principal and the parents areall done as near perfect parody.  The costumes by Jane Ruhm addimmensely to their tacky and overbearing images.  The wide-anglecamerawork by Cinematographer Stefan Czapsky is effective ataccentuating the evil in Matilda's young life.  Too often kid's shows go awry by not casting effective villains.Here Ferris is great as every kid's worst nightmare.  She gets sometough lines like, ""Use the rod and beat the child, that is my motto.""She tells the kids that, ""My idea of a perfect school is one in whichthere are no children.""  Her school's motto is, ""If you are having fun,you are not learning.""  If Trunchbull gets angry at kids, she throws them out of thewindow.  In typical Dahl fashion, children so discharged manage to pickflowers for their wonderful and sensitive teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey(Embeth Davidtz).  The star of show is the charming and marvelous child actress MaraWilson.  You may have seen her strength and her screen presence beforein 1993's MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET or 1992's MRS. DOUBTFIRE.  I hope shemakes many more films.  I liked all of the cast.  Beside the ones already mentioned, PaulReubens, a. k. a., Pee Wee Herman, plays an FBI agent trying to bustHarry.  I do wish DeVito had not narrated the picture.  I found it toojarring having Harry out of character when he was the narrator.  I loved the show from beginning to end.  I found myself clappingsometimes and then laughing out loud.  It has an infectiously happyending.  MATILDA runs a fast 1:33.  It is rated PG.  There are a fewsituations that might scare kids under 4 or 5, but the language ispretty mild, and there is no sex, nudity, or violence unless you countthe cartoonish violence of kids being thrown out the window.  Jeffreyloves the show and gives it three thumbs up.  I recommend the movie toyou and give it ***.  I almost gave it a little more. ",Matilda,PG,1996,3
596,"The most eagerly awaited motion picture of the summer, ""The MatrixReloaded"" comes with a great deal of high expectations placed uponit, thanks to a mind-blowing theatrical trailer as striking and flawlesslyorchestrated as any other in memory. Although not a big fan of 1999's""The Matrix,"" it was impossible to not get caught up in just how awesomethis $150-million sequel looked. With all of this in mind, it wouldbe a wise decision to enter into ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with loweredexpectations. This ultimately may be the only way to garner any sortof lasting satisfaction out of a film that, unlike the original, hasno beginning or end and cannot stand on its own. Written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, ""The Matrix Reloaded""is a bigger, more expansive follow-up that may reset the bar on visualeffects artistry, but otherwise lacks the originality and freshnessof its predecessor. While ""The Matrix"" too heavily relied upon referencingother films and genres, it at least offered sounds and sights neverglimpsed before on the big screen. It also could stand on its owntwo feet, with an undoubted beginning, middle, and end. Meanwhile,""The Matrix Reloaded"" thankfully avoids the needless homages and notablyadds depth to the central characters, but offers nothing from a narrativestandpoint that hasn't been seen before. In fact, so little of noteoccurs in this middle chapter that viewers will likely be able toskip from the original to November's ""The Matrix Revolutions"" withoutmissing much of anything in between. When audiences last saw Neo (Keanu Reeves), he had just come to termswith the discovery that his entire life up to that point had beena false reality within a computer system, and his future prophesiedthat he was to be The One to lead the people in the real world. Thereal world, of course, is sometime at the end of the 22nd century,when every city and human has been wiped out, save for the citizens of Zion.  As ""The Matrix Reloaded"" gets underway, Neo has gotten more used tohis messiac powers but has begun to suffer from nightmares in whichhis true love, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), is killed in battle. Neois unsure what the dream means, and opts not to tell Trinity. Theirdestinies, as well as that of leader Morpheus' (Laurence Fishburne),lead them to Zion, where the battle for the people's salvation isabout to begin in 72 hours with the attack of the machines. Also causingtrouble for Neo and his gang is the return of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving),who has found a way to multiply himself as his quest for becoming real continues. In creating this middle child in their trilogy, the Wachowski Brothershave fallen into the same trap that ""The Lord of the Rings: The TwoTowers"" did. With something coming before it and something after,the film feels empty and unfinished on its own. Unlike ""The EmpireStrikes Back,"" for example, which took the time to strengthen itsstory and raise the stakes, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" does not work as a singular entity. Such a visual effects triumph is ""The Matrix Reloaded"" that it isa shame not more time was spent innovating the premise. The city ofZion is disheartening in its sheer cliche of being a grimy, dirty,industrial heap of metal, and the citizens are all characterized as(mostly) nameless, faceless ravers who do little more than dance inrevealing clothing and cheer for their leaders' inspirational speeches.Speaking of which, one early scene in which Morpheus speaks to thecity is over-the-top and poorly reminiscent of Bill Pullman's presidentialspeech in 1996's ""Independence Day."" It is also somewhat of a disappointmentthat many of the action sequences are nothing more than kung-fu/martial-artsfighting. In the grand scheme of the world of the Matrix, such anact seems pointless and perfunctory. The centerpiece of the movie, a 14-minute highway chase sequence,is so mesmerizing in its audacity that it nearly makes the rest worthwading through. As Trinity and Morpheus are attacked by not only thequickly multiplying Agent Smith, but also two ghostly twins (AdrianRayment, Neil Rayment) the chase starts out by car; segues to motorbike,as Trinity zooms through traffic going in the opposite direction;and concludes atop a tractor trailer. Remarkably crafted, visuallystunning, and as adrenaline-pumping as just about any car chase scenein history, this quarter-hour interlude is a confined masterpiece.Another scene, in which Neo must fight off hundreds of Agent Smithclones, is nearly as cheer-inducing. Such moments of fun, unfortunately,do not make up for its decidedly rote narrative progression. As lovers Neo and Trinity, Keanu Reeves (2001's ""Hardball"") and Carrie-AnneMoss (2000's ""Red Planet"") excel in their roles this time around becausethey are given more to do. Their relationship is also believable andsweet, and the love they share for one another does heighten the stakeswhen Trinity's life appears to be in jeopardy. Jada Pinkett Smith(2001's ""Ali"") nicely introduces her strong-willed character of Niobe--apast girlfriend of Morpheus'--who aids in their quest to stop themachines and Agent Smith from domination. She will presumably havemore to do in the final film, but it is a good start. The late GloriaFoster, who passed away shortly after completing her role as the Oraclehere, is wonderful, conveying a deep and earnest warmth, while RandallDuk Kim (1998's ""The Thin Red Line"") also stands out as The Keymaker,who holds the keys to every door within the Matrix. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is no better or worse than its predecessor,improving upon certain aspects (the characters and action scenes)while lacking some of the stronger elements of the first film (itsoverall imagination and ingenuity). The picture ends cheaply, witha vague and clumsy twist that leads to a ""To Be Concluded"" moniker.This may have worked in something lighter and fluffier like the ""Backto the Future"" trilogy, but here all it does is prove, once and forall, that ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is an unsatisfactory motion pictureon its own. Let's hope that the upcoming ""The Matrix Revolutions""really offers the goods and ends the trilogy on a high note, because""The Matrix Reloaded"" regretfully does not take off and fulfill allthat it promised it would. ","Matrix Reloaded, The",R,2003,2.5
597,"When a scruffy, penniless man (Noah Taylor) introduces himself asAdolf Hitler to Jewish arts dealer Max Rothman (John Cusack) in theopening minutes of ""Max,"" a fictionalized account of Hitler's infamouspre-WWII years, a bitterly cold wind moves past them. Years of historyclasses and secondhand accounts tell us today of what a monster theanti-Semitic dictator Hitler became, and to see him prior to thesepivotal years, striking up a friendly conversation with a Jew, is chilling.  The directorial debut of screenwriter Menno Meyjes (1998's ""The Siege""),""Max"" never recaptures this indelible feeling of threat until thefrightening, irony-filled final scenes. What stands between thesebookending moments is wobbly, uneven filmmaking, at best. Whole scenesand key supporting characters constantly drift in and out of focus,with little rhyme or reason for their inclusion at all. Occasionaljump-cuts and awkward camera directions signal either too little principalphotography coverage, a screenplay (written by Meyjes) more appropriatefor the stage than the screen, or an incompetent editor. Whateverthe case may be, ""Max"" has ""first-time director"" written all overit, and the arresting, contemplative subject matter demands a moreexperienced filmmaker to do it justice. Set in Munich, Germany, circa 1918, Adolf Hitler meets Max Rothman--afellow soldier of WWI who lost his right arm in battle--at his modernart gallery showing. Hitler, an aspiring artist, wants Max to displayand sell his work in his art warehouse, but Max is not impressed enoughto accept his plea. Nevertheless, Hitler begin a sort of quasi-friendshipwith Max that goes against his burgeoning anti-Semitic views. AllHitler really wishes for is to get his artwork shown and respected,and Max responds by instructing him to put as much passion into hisart as he does into his political beliefs. All leads up to a finalethat lays the way for the ultimately destructive path Hitler later takes in life. The poorly-titled ""Max"" holds several thought-provoking ""what-if""scenarios and some intriguing dialogue exchanges, but it does notform a gratifying whole. One suspects that, had the story continuedthroughout Hitler's reign in Germany over WWII, it would have madefor a far better picture. Because the link between fiction and realityoverlaps so much, it is difficult to get fully involved in what is happening onscreen. It also doesn't help that the central character of Max Rothman isso impassively handled under the helm of Menno Meyjes' direction.Rothman, once an artist himself whose handicap from the war has puta stop to it, is fleetingly seen spending time with his loyal wife,Nina (Molly Parker), and two children, while carrying on an affairwith beautiful aristocrat Liselore (Leelee Sobieski). This love-trianglesubplot goes nowhere, leads to an anticlimactic conclusion, and isfrustrating in its undernourished development.  Largely a two-character show, it is nice to see John Cusack (2001's""Serendipity""), as Max Rothman, sway from the kind of safe charactershe usually plays, while Noah Taylor (2001's ""Vanilla Sky"") solidlyembodies, both physically and mentally, what Hitler might have beenlike during this time period. The Hitler in ""Max"" has not yet beencompletely corrupted, and isn't yet a bad man, but when, in one scene,he writes down, ""Art + Politics = Power,"" it is obvious which roadhe is headed down. The female roles, in comparison, are mostly ignored.Molly Parker (1997's ""Bliss""), as wife Nina, and the great LeeleeSobieski (2001's ""My First Mister""), as mistress Liselore, get onlya few minutes each of screen time, and little of worth to say or do. Save for some luscious visuals in the way of Lajos Koltai's (2002's""The Emperor's Club"") cinematography, ""Max"" is clearly suited morefor the stage, and aspires to add up to more than it does. Where thefilm is headed is always apparent, and how it gets there does notenlighten. Anyone who even cursorily knows the history of Adolf Hitlerwill not learn a single thing about him that they did not alreadyknow in the course of the film. The stunning ending that directorMeyjes has cooked up, ironic yet truthful, is the best that ""Max""ever gets, and it isn't worth wading through the first 100 minutes to get there.",Max,R,2002,2.5
598," Tim Hill's MAX KEEBLE'S BIG MOVE has no reason to be playing at your localmultiplex.  If it were an episode of a kid's television series, which is what itfeels like, it would rank a little below average.  Tune into the Disney channelon a random afternoon, and you'll find something similar and probably better. The three first-time screenwriters, Jonathan Bernstein, Mark Blackwell and JamesGreer, couldn't think of any fresh material.  Jokes come from food fights, aprincipal who falls over backwards in his chair and a squirrel that runs downthe principal's clothes.  The shame of it all is that some of the young actors manage to show some specialsparks in a movie that's almost terminally bland.  The best are Alex D. Linz(HOME ALONE 3) as Max Keeble and Zena Gray (the cute mascot from SUMMER CATCH)as Megan.  They both possess a likable spunk that makes them interesting evenwhen their characters aren't.  Max, a short kid who picks up an extra two inchesin height with his spiked hair, is off to his first day of junior high.  (Manyof the large kids in his school look like they have been forced to repeat somegrades.)  Megan is the canonical character of the friend who deserves Max'sattention, which is captured by Jenna (Brooke Anne Smith), a miniskirted ninthgrader with a killer body.  The top of Max's head doesn't even come up toJenna's chin.    The adults are uniformly awful, especially Robert Carradine as Max's doofus dadand Larry Miller as the school's unprincipled principal.  As the ""Evil Ice CreamMan,"" Jamie Kennedy engages in a series of embarrassingly bad slapstickroutines.  The plot has Max rebelling.  The type of kid who regularly gets hazed by theschool's bullies, he's striking back at everyone thanks to his newly foundfreedom.  After his parents tell him suddenly that they'll be moving in a fewdays, Max figures that he can get away with anything.  He'll be out of therebefore the bullies or the principal can exact their revenge on him.  Thedishonest principal, who is angling for a promotion to superintendent, is notone to be messed with.  He has escalated the school's normal zero tolerancepolicy to ""subzero tolerance.""  ""I'm not having fun,"" confesses the teacher on cafeteria duty when Max launchesthe big food fight.  And, like my dead audience, you probably won't be havingmuch fun either.  The surprise is that this junior high school comedy, which isaimed more to the seven-year-old set, doesn't have much in it that's funny forany age group, even the younger ones.  MAX KEEBLE'S BIG MOVE runs 1:25.  It is rated PG for ""some bullying and crudehumor"" and would be acceptable for kids of all ages.  My son Jeffrey, age 12, who had trouble thinking of anything that he liked aboutthe movie, gave it * 1/2.  He checked his watch frequently, something that Isuspect everyone will be doing in this short movie that feels extra long. ",Max Keeble's Big Move,PG,2001,1.5
599,"Based on the Stephen King short tale 'Trucks', this cheesy flick puts forward the terrifying notion of automated machines and vehicles taking on a life of their own and seeking to dominate the human race. The acting is thoroughly horrible and the FX looks as though it was put together by pre-school kids.  But perhaps the most shocking part of all this is that the movie's directed by one other thanƒƒ..Stephen King! Ace at booksbut stinky with films? You bet.",Maximum Overdrive,R,1986,2
600," The latest vehicle for the Muscles from Brussels, Jean-Claude VanDamme, is as nondescript as the tacked-on title (the film was originallytitled the more appropriate, though less slam-bang, The Exchange), fairlydevoid of any distinct personality that would set it apart from other actionflicks.  The film starts off promisingly enough, with Van Damme being bumpedoff within the first five minutes, after a well-staged and edited chase.Unfortunately for acting scholars everywhere, good ol' Jean-Clauderesurfaces as the twin of the dead J-C, and he heads off to New York toinvestigate the murder and the life of the brother he never knew he had.Needless to say, said brother was involved with some shady characters--theRussian Mafia--and he soon finds himself running for his life with hisbrother's lover (Natasha Henstridge, reduced to playing a typical actionmovie ""girl"" after her maneating turn in Species) in tow.  Like 1993's Hard Target, Maximum Risk marks the American debut of acelebrated Hong Kong action director--in this case, Ringo Lam, famous forhis On Fire trilogy.  Unfortunately, Lam isn't able to energize theminiscule goods delivered by Larry Ferguson's tired, unexciting script.Lam's visual style is a lot grittier and less flashy than John Woo's (theflashiest bit is a shot that follows the path of a bullet), and thus thescript's flaws aren't concealed too well.  He does, however, competentlystage what brief snatches of action there are, though none of it isespecially exciting.  Van Damme also comes off slightly worse than usual,appearing quite stiff, which is likely Lam's inadvertent doing.  In his HongKong work, he usually coaxes understated performances from capable actorssuch as Chow Yun-Fat;  Van Damme, on the other hand, isn't much of an actor,and as such his attempted ""subtlety"" comes off as just plain wooden.  As junky as Hard Target was, its flash was enough for Hollywood totake notice of John Woo.  I'm not so sure how Hollywood will treat RingoLam.  He's a talented filmmaker, but without Woo's stylistic flair and a VanDamme vehicle worse than Hard Target under his belt, his future Tinseltownprospects, unfortunately, don't look too bright.",Maximum Risk,R,1996,2
601,"Men have only one thing on their minds.  Agreed.  But women doas well.  The difference is that what women have on their mindshas greater repercussions.  Women want babies and when theycan't have them, they will resort to all sorts of procedures to getthem.  In Federico Garcia Lorca's story ""Yerma,"" the titlecharacter kills her husband for his inability to help her out in thatdepartment while in Ben Elton's movie ""Maybe Baby,"" the womanis the one who takes on most of the hardships for beingpresumably inconceivable. ""Maybe Baby"" is a light comedy but it is not a fluffy one, onethat you can forget about two minutes after leaving the theater. Its success can be attributed in part to a clever script by BenElton based on his own novel entitled ""Inconceivable,"" but mostlyby the writer-director's excellent casting.  He's put together ateam which bounces dialogue off one another smartly withparticularly amusing performances from character actor RowanAtkinson as a gynecologist and Tom Hollander, an Englishperformer who adopts an uncanny Scottish accent in the role ofan egotistical, over-the-top film director. ""Maybe Baby"" features the attractive and charming JoelyRichardson in the role of Lucy Bell, married to Sam (Hugh Laurie--considered by the director to be the Tom Hanks or perhaps eventhe George Clooney of his native Britain).  Sam is a well-paidscripter who is currently blocked not just in the writingdepartment.  His wife Lucy is in her thirties, desperately wants ababy, and in a fast, attention-getting opening scene buzzes herhusband on his cell phone to report that she is ovulating and thathe must stop what he's doing to bike right home. While a considerable part of the film deals with the frustrationsof baby-making--which makes sex more of a mechanical andanxiety-producing process than one of ecstasy--Elton takes us ina Pirandellian fashion into the business of making a film about acouple desperate to make a baby.  When Lucy discovers that herown ideas have been plagiarized by her husband, who haswritten the screenplay for the film, she goes ballistic, threateningtheir marriage.. On the negative side, Elton throws in hackneyed accounts ofsperm-bank donations, setting up the usual stick figures such asthe hysterically friendly nurse giving instructions to the poor malewho must now convert his main teenage pleasure into agruesome laboratory procedure.  This is nothing, of course,compared to what a woman must go through, including a processof in vitro fertilization presided over by a sadistic doctor (RowanAtkinson) who wields metal instruments like a modernTorquemada and who recites a litany of diseases that his patientdoes not have.  Ben Elton succeeds in turning a couple's paininto effective comedy while at the same time refusing to makelight of their anguish.",Maybe Baby,R,2001,1
602,"The audience in mid and late 1980s knew what to expect from anaverage American action films - heroes were almost alwaysVietnam War veterans, able and willing to use their deadly combatskills in order to exterminate drug dealers similar vermin and thusmake the world a better place. One of the last titles to employ thisformula was MCBAIN, 1991 action drama written and directed byJames Glickenhaus.  The plot begins immediately after the end of Vietnam War whenthe group of retreating US Special Forces, led by Santos (playedby Chick Venera), seeing the Viet Cong camp still containingAmerican POWs, decide to break the armistice, raid thecompound and liberate their comrades. Mc Bain (played byChristopher Walken), one of liberated POWs, promises that hewould return the favour when the time comes. Eighteen yearslater, Santos is fighting another war, this time leading theimpoverished masses of Colombian workers and peasants in arevolt against evil El Presidente (played by Victor Argo) and hisoppressive and corrupt regime, backed by narco-cartels. His lastdesperate charge against El Presidente's palace ends in failure,and Santos is quickly executed in front of TV cameras. Santos'sister Christina (played by Maria Conchita Alonso) travels to NewYork and seeks McBain's help in continuing the fight. Being boundby honour, McBain quickly begins collecting the Vietnam Warveterans and getting financial resources in order to set up a smallarmy that would bring down Colombian dictator.  MC BAIN is a very odd film because it combines right-wing militaryjingoism of Reagan era with the images and views usuallyassociated with the left-wing ideology. This is most evident in thecharacter of Santos, who starts as someone determined to stopCommunism from spreading in Southeast Asia, and ends likeguerrilla leader whose methods, ideology and image isindistinguishable from Che Guevara. Ideological surrealismdoesn't stop there - one of the characters is a greedy,Machiavellian arms dealer who suddenly sees the errors of hisways and embraces socialist love for his fellow man, while USgovernment, far from being defender of Free World values,consists of clueless incompetents unable to clean up their ownback yard. However, surrealism of MCBAIN goes way beyondideological content - best seen in the scene featuring one of themost original (and, in the real life, highly impractical) methods ofdowning the hostile aircrafts.  Of course, all that means that MCBAIN could have been an almostunbearable film if everyone takes it seriously. However, actionscenes, involving a lot of explosions and thousands of cheapFilipino extras, are reasonably well directed. The real worth of thisfilm could be found in its therapeutic nature - every now and thenwe need to see a film which gives us something that real life lacks.In this case these are the scenes of poor and weak overcomingrich and strong, forces of Good triumphing and evil-doers gettingwhat they deserve. This purpose is served even when thestandards of quality film-making aren't met, yet this is the reasonwhy the phrase ""guilty pleasure"" was invented in the first place. ",McBain,R,1991,2
603,"Driven by their rampant insecurities, teenage girls can be absolutely horribleto one another, a fact vividly illustrated by this compelling coming-of-agedrama that traces the twisted, terrifying 30-year relationship between twoBritish girls who make a pact to be friends forever. Anna Friel plays Marina,the beautiful, selfish, controlling leader of the dysfunctional duo, andMichelle Williams (Jen Lindley on TV's ""Dawson's Creek"") is Holly, her brainyyet vulnerable Jewish neighbor and willing accomplice as they explore hard drugsand casual sex. From puberty, Marina has frustrated Holly's crush on her roguisholder brother, Nat (Oliver Milburn), subconsciously fearing that he might comebetween them. (""It's like incest."") When they're in college in Brighton, Hollyexpresses a romantic interest in a visiting American teacher (Kyle Maclachlan)and Marina moves in with a manipulative seduction. Yet even when heartbrokenHolly becomes aware of Marina's sly, nasty game, she allows the festering,self-destructive friendship to continue. Director Sandra Goldbacher (""TheGoverness""), who co-wrote the screenplay with Laurence Corlat, perceptivelydelves into the passive-aggressive psychology of smothering co-dependence,illuminating elements of competition, jealousy, and resentment. The girls'respective parents are superbly delineated: Holly's (Allan Corduner, DeborahFindlay) are overly protective while Marina's youth-obsessed mother (TrudieStyler) can't hold on to her philandering pilot husband (Nicky Henson) - whilethe music and fashion fads reflect the passage of time. On the other hand, theoutcome is totally predictable and the pace is jarringly uneven.

Flashback 18 years to when his wife left him for the brainy,vertically-challenged limo driver (Tony Cox)  who fathered theirAfrican-American triplets whom Carrey has raised as a proud, loving father.The boys become rowdy, jive-talking geniuses (Jerod Mixon, AnthonyAnderson, Mongo Brownlee) but, having repressed his anger and resentmenttoo long, Charlie's suddenly got company - a foul-mouthed, aggressivealter ego named Hank. And they've both fallen for Renee Zellweger, afeisty, quirky gal who's on-the-lam from shady EPA investigators (ChrisCooper, Richard Jenkins) in a pointless plot. In the Jekyll-Hydetransformation, ""Rip Van Wussy"" Carrey cavorts and contorts, much to theamazement of his sympathetic supervisor (Robert Forster) and a psychoticalbino (Michael Bowman) who joins the road adventure.  Directed and writtenby Bobby and Peter Farrelly, plus Michael Cerrone, unfortunately thisromantic farce lacks the sweetness and outrageous fun of the Farrelly's earlier films.

605,"Say what you want about the state of cinema in 2004, thus far, butthe last few months have been enormously kind to teen comedies. Amazing,too, that just when said genre seemed almost played out, gasping forits last remaining breaths of life, a slew of highly perceptive, sharp-wittedfeatures would all be released within the same month or two. Moviesthat were not only intelligent and genuinely laugh-out-loud funnyand an accurate comment on some form of the high school experience,but also original. The unfortunately overlooked ""The Girl Next Door""was emphatic and vibrant enough to stand as one of the best teen filmsof the last decade. ""13 Going on 30"" was little more than bubblegumentertainment, but had enough real moments to make an impact. Andthe upcoming ""Saved!"" is a wonderfully written and acted satire, anode to John Hughes with a Christian high school spin. Now we have ""Mean Girls,"" a motion picture infinitely more adept,savvy, and intoxicating than its by-the-book marketing wo uld haveyou believe. Much of the credit can wholeheartedly go to ""SaturdayNight Live"" writer-actress Tina Fey, who has used the unlikely sourcematerial of a non-fiction book by Rosalind Wiseman called ""Queen Beesand Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends,and Other Realities of Adolescence"" to adapt into her feature filmdebut. Fey has  keyed into the memory of her own teenage years tocreate a movie that digs deeply and with precision into the innerworkings of a typical high school experience, and she does it allwith a good-hearted, non-condescending message and her own brand ofremarkably biting comic zingers. This quirky mix of opposites„lightand black comedy, zaniness and touching authenticity, broad topicsand bewitching satire„come together to make ""Mean Girls"" one of thebetter films so far this year. Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) may be 16-years-old, but having just movedback to the U.S. after living and being home-schooled in Africa allher life, the experience of attending a public school is foreign toher. Her first day is a disaster, as she does not have the first ideahow her classmates interact with each other based on their place inthe popularity stratosphere, and she ends up eating lunch quietlyin a bathroom stall. Cady's second day is a little better, however,when she is befriended by the semi-goth Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) andopenly gay Damian (Daniel Franzese), and they give her a tour of theschool's different groups. Janis despises no one more than Regina George (Rachel McAdams), thestuck-up queen bee of the Plastics„materialistic teen royalty whomeveryone loves to hate. When Regina and her two minions, the insecureGretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and supremely ditzy Karen Smith (AmandaSeyfried), invite Cady to join their exclusive club, Janis sees itas the perfect way for an outsider to get dirt on them and sabotagetheir faux-happy existence. Cady is only too happy to go along withJanis' plan when she sees what a vicious backstabber Regina can be.The longer she hangs out with the Plastics, however, Cady sees herselfslowly turning into them, the very type of person she can't stand. Directed at a knowing, zippy clip by Mark S. Waters (2003's ""FreakyFriday""), ""Mean Girl"" is a smashing satire surprisingly knowledgeableabout the what's, how's, and why's of teenage life. In its seemingexaggerations that, when you stop to think about them, aren't veryexaggerated at all, the film recalls 1999's brilliant ""Election"" and1989's ""Heathers,"" and, to a lesser but still notable extent, 1995's""Clueless."" It is in all of its sly, little details that a lesser,more conventional teen comedy would ignore, pebbles of truth thatmake you nod in recognition that, yes, that's exactly how it was whenyou were in high school. The way the lunch cafeteria is broken downinto unspoken quadrants, and one is not to even attempt to sit ata table where he or she clearly doesn't belong. The way kids interactwith each other, involved in gossip and secrets that, of course, theycan never keep to themselves. The way Cady's math teacher, the quietlylonely Ms. Norbury (Tina Fey), happens to see Cady and her friendsat the mall after getting off her shift as a bartender. Ms. Norburyis down-to-earth enough, and makes a valiant attempt to strike upa conversation with the girls, but they look at her as if she werefrom another planet. High school teachers, after all, are not supposedto have lives outside of class. The comedy, meanwhile, is tart and deliciously unexpected, relyingon humor found in the dialogue over the usual more physical angle(although there is some of that also). Very little is of the throwawayvariety because Tina Fey's screenplay is more concerned with ideasand smarts over cheap laughs. Fib bing about some part of yourselfin order to get someone to like you, sacrificing something you loveto do in order to not be looked upon negatively, wishing you weresomeone else while also hating them, dealing with a generally cluelessprincipal (Tim Meadows)„they're all here, true-to-life experiencesboth big and small that anyone who has ever been a teenager can attest to. The final thirty minutes take a decidedly more serious turn, evenwith a stream of laugh-inducing moments continuing, and by this pointthe film has earned the right to slow things down and narrow in onCady's transformation from a na¥ve girl into a wiser young woman.When the school's female population run out of control after xerox'sof a hateful book of put-down's featuring them is released in thehallways, Ms. Norbury calls for an intervention in which each of themmust apologize for something they have said or done to another student.The tone of the sequence, and the love and care and since rity putinto it, holds a kind of incendiary beauty. The same could be saidabout the climax at the spring dance, which goes a different routefrom the average prom finale, and a lovely final sequence that proveskids are more intelligent than some might think, with even the mosthopeless cases having the power to change for the better. For Lindsay Lohan (2004's ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen""),her nuanced, three-dimensional turn as Cady is the stepping stoneshe needs to show that she is capable of much more than just beinglikable and sweet in family-oriented features. The journey Cady takesthroughout her junior school year is a complex one, as she makes someawful mistakes before gaining the insight needed to become a betterperson, and Lohan is up to the challenge every step of the way. Thewhole cast, in fact, is without fault. As the Plastics, Rachel McAdams(2002's ""The Hot Chick""), Lacey Chabert (TV's ""Party of Five"" and2002's ""Daddy Day Care""), and newcomer Amanda Seyfried bypass theeasy route of playing their parts as irredeemable caricatures; theyfeel like real teenage girls who can be nasty, but not insufferablyso, and there is more depth to them than at first meets the eye. As Cady's outsider friends Janis and Damian, Lizzy Caplan (2002's""Orange County"") and Daniel Franzese (2001's ""Bully"") are infectiousscene-stealers. Even Regina's ex-boyfriend, Aaron, whom Cady has eyesfor, is played by Jonathan Bennett as a nice guy who is annoyed bythe Plastics as much as everyone else is. ""Saturday Night Live"" membersfrom the past and present fill out the memorable adult roles. TinaFey is delightfully on-target as Ms. Norbury; Tim Meadows (2000's""The Ladies Man"") is Principal Duvall; Amy Poehler (2004's ""Envy"")is funny as Regina's overly involved young mother, who attempts toblend herself into her daughter's pack; and Ana Gasteyer (2000's ""WhatWomen Want"") is Cady's increasingly frazzled mom. Fast-paced and never less than wholly engaging, ""Mean Girls"" has beendeceptively marketed in its trailer and TV ads as a bubbly, commonplaceteen comedy when nothing could be further from the truth. The plottrajectory has a mind to its madness, and the film itself has a distinctvoice and rich ideas to go along with its sillier moments of comedy.Amidst it all is Cady, a protagonist that gains our sympathies andwhom we always like, even when she finds herself straying off theright path. Rooting for her to regain her footing is only part ofthe fun.

606,"      As the twin surfer dudes, Stew and Phil Deedle, lay bandaged andunconscious in the hospital, Phil comes to first and chooses thecoolest way to wake his brother.  Yanking out his IV, he uses it like awater pistol to soak his brother's face.  This bit of lame physicalhumor is typical of Disney's MEET THE DEEDLES, a movie more to beendured that watched.  (I stopped looking at my wife during thescreening, since every time I did, she'd start sticking her finger inher throat.  And she's right, it is that bad.)       Directed without any imagination by Steve Boyum, whose longbackground in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction,the film limps along at best.  Boyum attempts to keep the pace movingby staging stunts, stunts and more stunts.  Amazingly for someone withhis background, he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones, and wehave a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more.  Butwho's counting?       And then there is the script by James Herzfeld, whose only otherfilm, TAPEHEADS from a decade ago, was so awful that it is considered acult classic.  MEET THE DEEDLES, however, is painfully bad rather thanlaughably bad.  It will probably be in and out of the theaters like atornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything.  Herzfeldtreats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes ""Your geyser's ageezer,"" and ""I'd like to put a Deedle in her haystack.""       As the movie opens, the twins, who at one point describethemselves modestly as ""a walking Kodak moment,"" are celebrating their18th birthday.  As they ride a parasail high above the waters ofWaikiki, a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski.  As heirs to thefabulous fortune of the Deedle empire, the boys are sent by theirfather to Camp Broken Spirit at Yellowstone to transform the twolaid-back beach bums into men.       As they arrive in their wetsuits in Yellowstone, they've got theirsurfboards, skateboards, and a Hawaiian drink machine the size of anarmoire.  Their camp has gone out of business, but they are mistakenfor new Park Rangers.  The rest of the movie has them fighting thepark's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger,played by Dennis Hopper, who is out to stop Old Faithful before itsbillionth birthday celebration, scheduled for later in the week.Hopper, who has made some wonderful movies, CARRIED AWAY being a recentfavorite, does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferousmaterial.  This isn't his worst acting, but MEET THE DEEDLES isarguably the worst movie he's ever been in.       Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker, as Stew and Phil, give lifelessperformances.  The only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talentis a cute little prairie dog named Petey.       Even the cinematography by David Hennings is so prosaic that itmanages to make Yellowstone look dull.  To add insult to injury,Hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups, which only serve to remindus of the inanity of the dialog.  Put a ten-foot pair of lips on thescreen, and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said.       Although Boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film isappropriate for families, one wonders how many skateboarders willattempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard whilenegotiating a busy and twisting mountain road.  They make it look likeso much fun that I'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt.       ""How could this possibly be worst,"" asks Phil.  Just when yoususpect it can't, the movie takes a turn further downhill.  Its lowpoint may have you looking for an airline barf bag.  After Phil'sgirlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil, they suck in a long worm.Like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in LADY AND THE TRAMP, theirlips finally meet in a kiss.  As they pull back, their faces are fullof the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested.       MEET THE DEEDLES runs about an hour and a half.  It is rated PGfor a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6and up.       My son Jeffrey and his friend Nickolas, both almost 9, gave theshow ***.  They both thought the scenes with Petey were among theirfavorites.  Nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus beardrives a jeep, and Jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circuselephant was referred to as Dumbo. ",Meet the Deedles,PG,1998,0

That's the dreaded dilemma facing Greg Focker (BenStiller) who realizes that it's important to get her father'spermission before he proposes to his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo). Atrip from Chicago to New York for her younger sister's wedding seemslike the right occasion but things go from bad (lost luggage) to worsewhen her father Jack (Robert De Niro) turns out to be an eccentric,dogmatic, humorless ex-CIA agent, specializing in psychologicalprofiling, who spent 19 months in a Vietnamese prison camp. ""Under myroof, it's my way or the Long Island Expressway,"" dictates Jack,regarding 21st century sexual mores. Feeling like an outsider about toabscond with their first-born, Greg manages to do everything wrong, asthe cat disappears, septic tank overflows, sump pump explodes andwedding altar catches fire. And his discomfort is augmented by Greg'sbeing a male nurse in a houseful of doctors. There's a hilarious scenein which Greg muses about the meaning of ""Puff the Magic Dragon,""impelling Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) to placate Jack later, noting,""Maybe he uses marijuana for medicinal purposes."" Ben Stiller'sperfect as the hapless, anxiety-ridden interloper, while Robert DeNiro uses his serious, dramatic intensity to be an intimidatingadversary - much to the credit of director Jay Roach (""AustinPowers"").

608,"We live in the era of American military supremacy, which ismost vividly embodied in the US combat aviation, thedeadliest military force in history, able to strike atanyone and anywhere almost without worrying about being hitback. Actually, when US combat plane gets shot down thesedays, it is so rare and unusual event that Hollywood makesthe movie out of it. Sixty years ago, with less severetechnological gap between those doing the bombing and thosebeing bombed, flying combat missions required much morecourage and similar military virtues for US servicemen thantoday. One of the films that clearly illustrates this pointis MEMPHIS BELLE, 1990 war drama directed by Michael Caton-Jones.  The plot of the film is loosely based on the WW2 eventdepicted in MEMPHIS BELLE, famous 1944 documentary directedby William Wyler. In May 1943 Hitler is still holding almostentire Europe under his grip and the best the Allies can doabout it from their bases in Britain is to bomb industrialtargets in Germany and occupied countries and thus weakenthe Nazi war effort. Two major Allied air forces employdifferent strategy in their bombing campaign - moreexperienced British rely on massive night raids, whileAmericans bomb by day, which allows better accuracy but alsomeans more risk for bombers and their crews. One of thosebombers is B-17 ""Flying Fortress"" commanded by CaptainDennis Dearborn (played by Matthew Modine) and nicknamed""Memphis Belle"" after his wife. Its crew has completed 24combat missions so far after the next one will the quotaafter they are to finish their tour of duty. They are thefirst crew to do it without scratch and public relationsofficer Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Derringer (played by JohnLithgow) wants to bring the plane and the crew to USA as apart of huge morale-boosting effort. But such prospects aredistant future for Dearborn and Colonel Craig Harriman(played by David Strathairn). They are more concentrated onthe next day's mission - raid on heavily defended planefactory in Bremen. When ""Memphis Belle"" takes off, Dearbornand the rest of his ten-man crew know that the statistics isagainst them and they must employ all of their skills,abilities and luck to do their job and come home in onepiece.  From a strictly technical standpoint, MEMPHIS BELLE is goodexample of Hollywood craftsmanship. The budget wasrelatively small for a film that covers one of the mostspectacular armed contests of the last century, yet theaudience can't notice it. Producer David Puttnam anddirector Michael Caton-Jones took great care about authenticperiod details, and also employed good special effects crew.That crew did a very convincing good job and even the mostcareful viewers can't distinguish scale models from real""Flying Fortresses"" used in the film. The ensemble cast ofmostly young actors who portray the crew of ""Memphis Belle""is very good, while John Lithgow is terribly miscast in therole of completely useless character. The pacing of the filmis also good - after a deliberately slow start that allowedcharacter development, the action intensifies and the twohours of MEMPHIS BELLE pass surprisingly quickly. The battlescenes are both very exciting, realistic and oftenheart-wrenching.  Unfortunately, despite all that, MEMPHIS BELLE still leavesthe impression of the film far from fulfilling itspotential. The main reason for that is in the weak script byMonte Markham, which is nothing more than collection ofcliches gathered from 1940s and 1950s American war movies.Because of that, experienced viewers know the fate ofcertain characters in advance, and the ending is ratherpredictable. The musical score by George Fenton, basedheavily around songs like ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Danny Boy"",isn't very impressive. Finally, WW2 buffs would find somehistorical inaccuracies in the film (apart from Caton-Jones'film being complete fiction, almost unrelated to Wyler'sdocumentary). The worst of them - US bomber crews makinggreat deal about not hitting civilian targets in Germany -was probably attempt to make the characters more sympatheticto the audience in ""politically correct"" 1990s. In reality,US airmen and their superiors couldn't care less aboutcollateral damage to civilians, because destruction of theGerman morale by creating misery among civilian populationwas one of the specific aims of the bombing campaign andsource of controversies that last to this day.  However, all those flaws aside, MEMPHIS BELLE is excitingand entertaining film that could be enjoyed even by thosewho don't have particular interest in the history of bomberaviation. ",Memphis Belle,PG-13,1990,2
609," UFOs.  Aliens.  Slime.  Will Smith.  What more can you ask for?  Inthe case of last year's Independence Day, a self-awareness of its inherentridiculousness would have helped.  That problem does not befall Smith'slatest bout with creatures from outer space, Barry Sonnenfeld's witty andfun sci-fi-action-comedy Men in Black.  In this adaptation of Lowell Cunningham's obscure Marvel/Malibucomic, Smith stars as a New York cop who is recruited by mysterious Agent K(Tommy Lee Jones) into the ultrasecret underground group known as the Men inBlack, which overlook intergalactic relations.  It is up to Agent K and thenewly christened Agent J to prevent an alien bug disguised as a farmer(Vincent D'Onofrio) from stealing a galaxy and thereby causing aninterplanetary war and, in turn, the destruction of earth.  If this sounds a tad confusing to you, you're not alone.  MiB'sbiggest problem is its story--the primary plot cooked up by screenwriter EdSolomon is introduced fairly late in the game and never completely adds up(just what is the deal with the bag of marbles at the end?).  But by thetime the nominal plot takes center stage, the film has already won you overwith the script's witty one-liners, self-effacing sense of humor, and bashesat pop culture (Sylvester Stallone is skewered in one of the more inspiredgags); and its imaginative production design (by Bo Welch) and visualeffects (supervised by Eric Brevig).  Most impressive, however, are thealien makeup effects designed by Rick Baker.  The creatures look likeexactly that--living, breathing alien creatures and not animatronic puppets.Especially convincing is an alien infant whom J delivers; slinky, squidlike,and covered in slime, the expressive baby alien succeeds in doing what thebest human infants do onscreen--look cute and elicit ""aw""s.  As impressive a technical achievement MiB is, it would not haveworked without a strong lead duo, and Jones and Smith make a great team.Smith's natural, infectious ebullience plays off well against the stoicJones, who is at his deadpan best, engaging in some ridiculous situationswith the straightest of faces.  It is one thing to wear a straight facewhile having a heated discussion with an uncooperative dog, but it's quite awhole other level of achievement to do that and convincingly appear to treatthe situation with the gravest of seriousness.  Jones's K never shakes offhis grim face even when he is joking, making his performance that much moreeffective and funny.  D'Onofrio has some great slapstick moments as theinsect who hasn't quite got the hang of wearing a human skin suit, andthough she's underused, Linda Fiorentino, as coroner Dr. Laurel Weaver, fitsquite snugly with the team of Jones and Smith.  Men in Black is certain not to reach the stratospheric box officeheights of Smith's bountiful bout with aliens last summer, but in sheddingthe self-importance and jingoism of the two-hour-plus ID4 and taking on amost welcome self-aware sense of humor, the lean, mean, 98-minute MiB is notjust a better film, it's also a lot more fun.",Men in Black,PG-13,1997,3
610,"     Based on a true story, this is an old-fashioned,inspirational military drama - which works for it and against it. CubaGooding Jr. effectively plays Carl Brashear, who became the Navy'sfirst African-American master diver, while Robert De Niro, as BillySunday, is the manic redneck instructor who torments and humiliateshim before becoming his mentor. ""Why do you want this so badly?"" he'sasked. ""Because they said I couldn't have it"" is Brashear's meaningfulreply. Hal Holbrook adds to the rampant racism as the terrorizingcommander of the Naval Diving School. Powers Boothe is the firstofficer to acknowledge Brashear's deep determination to succeed, andDavid Keith is the sympathetic officer who's there when a freak,shipboard accident cripples Brashear, causing the eventual amputationof his leg.  Executive produced by Bill Cosby, written by ScottMarshall Smith and directed by George Tillman Jr. (""Soul Food""), thefilm obviously fictionalizes rather than depicts the variousbiographical incidents that transformed Brashear's early life as aKentucky sharecropper's son (""Don't end up like me,"" his fatherwarns.) and his military career which began in the '60s with messduty. Gooding's and De Niro's wives are predictably played by AunjanueEllis and Charlize Theron, respectively, while Michael Rapaport,Joshua Leonard and Holt McCallany portray other trainees. Creditcinematographer Anthony B. Richmond for capturing the danger andundersea isolation of the divers and the taut tension of the divingprogram's final exam. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Men ofHonor"" is a well-intentioned, if melodramatic 5, slipping into sloppysentiment a bit too often as it extols Brashear's courage andindomitable spirit.

Robin Wright Penn plays a divorced single mom whoworks as a researcher for the Chicago Tribune. While on vacationalone in Cape Cod, she finds a bottle containing a beautiful, poetic loveletter from a man to a woman named Catherine. The signature is simply""G"" but she tracks down the sender. He's Garret Blake - a.k.a. KevinCostner - a sailboat builder who lives on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.Since the death of his wife Catherine, he has led a sad, solitaryexistence - until Penn appears, literally, on his doorstep. Inexplicably,she doesn't tell him she's found his missive in a bottle. She's scaredof being honest, afraid to trust. So she pretends she's justa tourist interested in sailing, and they begin a gentle, tender romance,complete with moonlit marshmallow fights, while the audience waits forthe inevitable confrontation scene in which he discovers the truth andturns on her. Handsome, smiling Paul Newman, as Dodge, Costner's sassy,caustic, irascible father, deftly steals the picture, in one scenemuttering, ""If I was about 150 years younger, you'd be in trouble, younglady.""

612," Joan of Arc was the illiterate peasant girl who, in the 15thcentury, believed that God told her how to defeat the all-conqueringEnglish army and restore Charles II to the throne.  She united thedishevelled French army and routed the English at the siege ofOrleans.  But later she was denounced as a witch and burnt at thestake.  Some five hundred years later she was canonised by theVatican, although her life is still the subject of much speculationand controversy.  It's a story that has been told on screen many times before,most recently in the earnest television miniseries, starring LeeleeSobieski and Peter O'Toole.  However French director Luc Besson (LaFemme Nikita, The Professional, etc) gives this familiar story asuitably epic treatment in this bold and bloody retelling of thelegend.  Besson has spared little expense in bringing the story to thescreen.  The costumes, the lavish production design, and the authenticlooking Czech locations all bring the era to life beautifully.Thierry Arbogast's cinematography is also superb.  Although visually quite splendid, the initial sequences, whichdeal with Joan's early visions, are a little clumsily handled.However, Besson soon comes into his own with his assured direction ofthe film's bloody and brutal battle sequences.  With Braveheart, MelGibson established a new standard for medieval battle scenes.  Bessonenthusiastically follows that example with his spectacular centrepiece, the bloody siege of Orleans, which occupies much of the film's150 minutes.  Besson efficiently captures the carnage and confusion ofbattle, and he takes his cameras right into the thick of theconfusion.  But he also explores in some detail the fascinating politicsof church and state that ultimately decided Joan's fate.  Havingdecided that she had outlived her usefulness, they both conspired torid themselves of the troublesome and charismatic Joan.  Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, etc) is superb as thecomplex Joan, and she handles both the physical elements and the morecerebral and emotional elements of the role effectively.  She isespecially good in portraying the difficulty Joan had in reconcilingher bloody actions as a fierce warrior with her deep religiousconvictions.  Faye Dunaway is also great as Charles II's schemingmother-in-law, who was also obviously the power behind the Frenchthrone.  Dustin Hoffman makes the most of a small role as Joan'sconscience, while John Malkovich makes a nicely pragmatic Charles II.  Andrew Birkin's script often smacks of trite Americancliches and rather 20th century sounding dialogue.  While this mayoffend the purists, it is nonetheless a wonderfully effective way ofbringing this 500 year old legend alive and making Joan's struggleseem relevant for contemporary audiences.  ","Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The",R,1999,2

Well, I havethe movie for you--MIAMI RHAPSODY.       First, let's play guess the director.  You have a movie set on theEast Coast and filled with Jewish people and comedy.  It starts with anelegant typeface and has Cole Porter jazz music playing loudly yetsoothingly in the background.  When it cuts to the actors, you haveSarah Jessica Parker talking documentary style to the camera.  Shedelivers a soliloquy about her life to a never seen doctor behind thecamera.  Playing a lead role as her mother is Mia Farrow.  Finally, thedialog is fast paced, witty, and 80% of the references are about sex.       So you guessed it?  Woody Allen, right?  Wrong.  It was writtenand directed by David Frankel who does a wonderful homage to Woody.  Itdoes not compare to Woody's best, but it is rather like his comediessans Woody's usual hidden darker meanings.       The movie is about Parker's mother, dad (Paul Mazursky), brother(Kevin Pollak), and sister (Carla Gugino).  They and everyone they meetseem to be having or wanting to have sex with everyone and especiallywith their friend's spouses.  This is not very done explicitly--it ismainly handled with some funny dialog.  The only lines I can rememberare not suitable for printing, but you will laugh when you hear them.The only jokes that had no place in it and certainly did not work werea couple of tired, old anti-working women jokes that I have no idea whythey put them in since the rest of the script was bright andintelligent.       The main plot of the show is that mom and dad have been marriedfor a long time.  They have fought during most of their marriage andboth started having affairs to bring some fun and romance to theirlives.  In the early scenes each openly and causally tells this toParker who says she does not want to hear about them having sex witheach other much less with someone else!       The rest of the show is just a lot of light hearted dialog.  Thereis not much of a plot.  There is no tension or drama, and there iscertainly no hidden meanings or serious parts.

614,"In 1991 Jonathan Demme brought the wrath of American gay community on himself by having a sexually ambiguous character for a villain in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. For that crime he had to make amends with PHILADELPHIA two years later. It could be argued that similar thing happened to Irish director Neil Jordan after CRYING GAME, 1992 movie that had very negative portrayal of IRA. Whatever his motives, Jordan had much more favourable portrayal of IRA in MICHAEL COLLINS, 1996 biopic that dealt with that organisation's legendary leader and Irish freedom fighter.  The plot of the film begins in 1916, while Ireland used to be part of British Empire. Trying to exploit British involvement in WW1, group of Irish nationalists stage famous Easter Uprising. Just like many times in the Irish past, this valiant effort succumbs to the British military might; most of the rebels are captured and many later shot. Michael Collins (played by Liam Neeson), one of the survivors, learned from that defeat and decided to fight British by unconventional means. Three years later, while his comrade and Sinn Fein leader Eamon de Valera (played by Alan Rickman) goes to America to plead for Irish indepenedence, Collins sets up a small but dedicated group of volunteers that would act as an underground arm. Instead of openly confronting British, they would use hit and run tactics against policemen and government officials and later melt in the general population. In doing so Collins gains important ally in the form of Ned Broy (played by Stephen Rea), policeman who starts working as a mole within the heart of British security service. As a result of Broy's information, Collins and his men are able to wipe out all the informers and secret agents and thus put whole British security apparatus in disarray. British retaliate on innocent civilians, thus fuelling Irish resentment and broadening support for IRA. After two years of bloodshed both sides are exhausted, and when the time comes for negotiations, de Valera, who became envious of Collins' popularity, gives him the unpopular task of leading negotiations. The peace treaty gives Ireland freedom, but the island remains divided between North and South; many Irish nationalists resent this so much that Collins now has to fight another, even bloodier war and receive military aid from his former enemies. This time people on the opposing side include even his best friend Harry Boland (played by Aidan Quinn).  MICHAEL COLLINS won prestigious Golden Lion award at Venice Film Festival thanks to prologue that had pandered to that festival jury's ultra-leftist sentiments. In the prologue Neil Jordan claims that Michael Collins invented urban guerrilla warfare and later served the inspiration for the famous and successful revolutionaries like Mao Zedong. This is far from truth, because ""urban guerrilla"" (or ""terrorism"") had been applied by many other revolutionary organisations in the past. Furthermore, those who tried to copy Collins' methods and achieve political aims through terror - whether their political orientation was left or right - usually failed.  On the other hand, although the film had its deal of historical speculation (especially towards the relationship between Collins and de Valera), it couldn't be accused of inventing history. Most of the incidents portrayed in the film really took place - it is their interpretation that caused controversy, especially in Britain, where some accused Jordan of being terrorism apologist.  MICHAEL COLLINS is more-or-less accurate, but being accurate and giving complete picture of Irish Troubles are two different things. Despite great deal of enthusiasm in his native Ireland for this project, Jordan had to rely on Hollywood for this project and simplify the story. So, MICHAEL COLLINS conforms to the usual stereotypes about evil English oppressing poor Irish and never mentions ""Catholics"" and ""Protestants"" - two words that symbolise the main reason why Ireland remained tragically divided to this day. And the negotiations between Collins and British government - the event that sealed both Ireland's and Collins' fate - is simply not covered in this film. Jordan, on the other hand, compensates those holes in the script with spectacular scenes that reconstruct the period. In that Jordan is aided by authentic locations and group of talented actors. Liam Neeson, despite being significantly older than historical Collins, is more than convincing incarnation of Irish leader. Jordan's old associate Stephen Rea is very good as policeman who becomes dedicated follower of  a man he supposed to track, while Alan Rickman, best known as a villain of DIE HARD, must turn into Collins' arch-nemesis in the absence of British characters who could serve that purpose.  All this could have produced an interesting and captivating film way above the usual Hollywood standards of screen history. But Jordan, in an attempt to make his story closer to American audience, made another fatal mistake - he chose Julia Roberts, American movie superstar, to play Collins' love interest Kitty Kiernan. To say that Roberts was wrong for the role was understatement, especially when we consider the large number of Irish and British talents who could have handled the job. Presence of Roberts' character (although based in history) is irritating and only takes precious time that could have been used to give more historical exposition.   Perhaps this review might seem unkind to MICHAEL COLLINS, but this criticism is probably mild compared with what awaits this film in the future. In today's world it is difficult to imagine audience sympathetic to the attempts that try to blur the line between terrorists and freedom fighters.  ",Michael Collins,R,1996,2

Undaunted, he goes to LittleItaly to find her father - that's James Caan - at his restaurant, ""TheLa Trattoria,"" where the song ""We Are Family"" plays in the backgroundas he meets the wiseguys. Sure enough, before the bumbling Brit knowsit, his auction gallery is being used for mob money laundering and theFBI is paying a visit. The scene where the gregarious Caan tries toteach the refined Grant the goombah enunciation of ""fuhgeddaboutit"" isa gem. One complication leads to another and soon he becomes known as""Mickey Blue Eyes"" by all the wrong people. Screenwriters AdamScheinman and Robert Kuh and director Kelly Makin deliver thehumorous, if cliche-ridden set-ups, but what makes the frenzied farcework is Hugh Grant, who seems to have inherited Cary Grant's abilityto maintain an unflappable charm and graceful dignity no matter howhumiliating the circumstances. Whether he's a boyish ""Notting Hill""book seller who falls for a movie star or a proper, innocentEnglishman who behaves with aplomb when finds himself with a bloodycorpse, Grant handles his fish-out-of-water roles with witty,sophisticated charm, adept at both verbal sparring and physicalantics.

There are also fantasy scenes paired withtheir real-world result.  For example, Voight approaches awould-be customer, and there is a fantasy scene of himescorting her to a posh suite.  The reality scene hasher making a quick exit, leaving Voight standing inthe street with a stupid look on his face.  Theseflashback/fantasy scenes are even better than the restof the film, and it is a wonder that more films do notmake use of them.  Certainly Schlesinger was deservingof his 'Best Director' Academy Award.  Dustin Hoffman is endearing in the role of Rizzo.Hoffman can be very likable in secondary roles (as in""Papillon""), where his character can show moreeccentricities.  Voight was a late casting, after the role had beenoffered to Michael Sarrazin and even Elvis Presley.The Joe Buck character is perhaps too naive andstupid, but Voight is very credible as a yokel. ",Midnight Cowboy,R,1969,3.5
617,"      ""This place is fantastic,"" John Kelso, the new reporter for ""Townand Country"" magazine, tells his agent.  ""It's like 'Gone with theWind' on mescaline.""  There in Savannah to cover a famous Christmasparty, he finds himself right in the middle of a murder investigation,so he decides to stay and write a book about it.       Most critics have their least favorite genres.  One of mine is themovie whose appeal derives solely from a string of extremely quirkycharacters.  Conversely, one of my favorites is the courtroom drama.The former genre is extremely prevalent whereas the latter has fallensomewhat out of favor.  The few courtroom dramas that are released areall too often mediocre.  Last year's best was the devastatingdocumentary, PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS       As America's reading public knows, MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOODAND EVIL is based on John Berendt's wildly popular book by the samename.  Since the film contains both a murder trial and a host ofeccentric characters, I went in excited but with reservations.Although the movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, is not as good as I'dhoped, it is a delicious satire on the South.  As a native Southerner,I found the accents true, the culture believable, and the jokesdead-on.       The beauty of John Lee Hancock's script is the fine line he walksbetween realism and parody.  All of the characters are believable, but,with the exception of Kelso, each has his or her own special oddities.Although Eastwood comments in the press notes on how impressed he waswith the way Hancock boiled a complex book down to its essence, morepruning still would have improved the final product.  Paul Hipp, forexample, plays an inconsequential character named Joe Odom, whose wholepart could and should have been expunged.       As John Kelso, John Cusack gives another great performance.Unlike his wonderful acting in GROSSE POINTE BLANK, where he providedthe humor, in MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL he spends histime in reaction shots.  Since of necessity Kelso has to hang aroundwith a black transvestite named Lady Chablis, Cusack has manyopportunities for displaying his shocked, wild-eyed look as LadyChablis hits on Kelso with abandon.       As one of the almost completely comical characters in the show,Lady Chablis plays herself.  She gets some hilarious one-liners, andshe has a gift for physical comedy that keeps the show from everdragging when she is on the screen.  And her slinky, sequined dressesare to die for.       In an old moneyed South, Kevin Spacey stars in the film as JimWilliams, a nouveau riche antiques dealer.  (""Yes, I am nouveau riche,but it's the riche that counts."")  He holds court in his block-longmansion, and all the rich and famous come to call.  Spacey, with theexception of his low key middle part, owns every scene he is in.  Heoozes charm and confidence from every pore.  With a little blackmustache and a sleek silk vest, he sets the gold standard for attire ina fashion conscious city.  (The rich and famous at his parties havetheir own stories.  One pair of grande dames discuss what caliber ofpistols their husbands had used to commit suicide.)       Eastwood stages the scenes with such naturalness that you feelright at home.  As the warm southern night air drives party goersoutside, they are serenaded by that southern minstrel, the lowlycricket.  Ah, the living is easy.       Into this den of gentility, comes a tattooed street hustler namedBilly Hanson, played by Jude Law from GATTACA.  Although Jim is knownto be gay, he does not speak of it in society.  Billy, Jim's lover, hasno such compunctions.  During Jim's famous Christmas party, Billy showsup and threatens Jim with a broken bottle.  When Billy later turns updead in Jim's living room, Jim is arrested for the murder.  The bulk ofthe movie has John doing investigative research for his book andhelping Jim.       Along the way John runs into a string of the local curios.  Myfavorite is the guy who keeps house flies on short strings so they allbuzz around his head.  There is a reason for this and for why he alwayscarries a bottle of poison with him, but I will let you find out.Another guy walks a dog who died two decades ago.  And yes, there's agood reason for that one too.       Irma P. Hall appears in a small role as Minerva, the voodoo expertwho, one midnight, takes John and Jim to the Garden of Good and Evil.""To understand the living, you got to commune with the dead,"" sheexplains to John.       Movie trials need good defense attorneys.  As Sonny Seiler, JackThompson gives a relaxed performance as Jim's smooth-talking Southernlawyer.  A college football fan so loyal that he leaves at key pointsduring the trial preparation to see his beloved Georgia Bulldogs play,he nevertheless, subtlety outfoxes the prosecution.       Finally, in a large cast Clint's daughter Alison Eastwood standsout as an attractive woman named Mandy Nichols, who helps John in hisinvestigation.  And more.       ""Truth is in the eye of the beholder,"" Jim tells John.  ""Youbelieve what you choose, and I'll believe what I know.""  A film thatrevels in ambiguity, it is a delightful piece of entertainment even ifnot the major film that I expected.       MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL runs a little too long at2:15.  It is rated R for some profanity, some violence, and maturethemes.  It would be fine for most teenagers. ",Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,R,1997,3
618," With large helpings of Shakespeare being so popular these days, MichaelHoffman has prepared his own cinematic casserole based on one of theBard's livelier plays, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.  (The movie isformally titled WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM to avoidconfusion with Tennessee Williams's and other playwrights' versions.)  With an established pedigree in lavish costume drama from his respectedRESTORATION, Hoffman might seem a natural to cook up something specialfor viewers.  He combines some of Hollywood's finest acting ingredientsbut comes up with little more than leftover hash.  Partially modernizing the drama, Hoffman sets the action in Italy at theturn of the 19th century.  The opening credits explain that it was atime when the bustle was on the wane and the bicycle was on the rise,which were compatible trends.  This humor is typical of thetoo-cute-to-be-funny level upon which the movie operates.  When theactors, dressed in 19th century costumes, begin to speak the language ofShakespeare, it grates on the nerves like watching John Wayne withJapanese dubbing.  The sets are sumptuous, the cinematography handsome, and the operaticmusic stirring.  So long as the actors aren't speaking, the movie is afeast for the eyes and ears, much like RESTORATION.  A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM should have you alternately laughing andgrinning, but Hoffman's version leaves one staring quizzically, neverknowing quite what to make of it.  With a killer cast and a great play,he manages to make the poetically beautiful surprisingly bland.  Many of the actors shine above the dullness of the direction.  Chiefamong these is Calista Flockhart (""Ally McBeal""), who steals the show asHelena.  With bewitching twitching, she flits about the set withunbounded energy and infectious good spirits.  Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett, as Titania and Oberon, compete inthe movie's beauty contest.  Pfeiffer, who long ago seems to havelocated the Fountain of Youth, gets my vote, but Everett is a closesecond.  Neither give especially memorable performances, but looks countfor a lot when you have to sit through such a sleep-inducing production.And if you've ever needed a reason to believe in fairies, Pfeiffer, as afairy, supplies a most convincing argument.  Kevin Kline gets to chew up the scenery playing a bad actor namedBottom.  He makes an especially convincing ass during one of the fairysequences.  His play within a play at the end, however, is a disaster.It is supposed to be laughably bad but is, instead, merely bad.  Stanley Tucci, who seems to enjoy every movie he's in, has a playful,good time as Puck.  Hoffman, who also wrote the screen adaptation, makes many strangestaging choices; none more so than having Flockhart engage in mudwrestling.  Like so much of the movie, this scene is more weird thanfunny.  Given all of the other liberties Hoffman takes with the play, it is ashame that he didn't shortened it more.  This version quickly becomestedious and frequently drags.  If he had brought the picture in at anhour and a half, it could only have helped.  ""Lord, what fools these mortals be,"" Puck complains.  This would be theperfect tagline for this production for it is indeed quite foolishlydone.  On the other hand, lame Shakespeare is still Shakespeare.  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM runs too long at 1:58.It is rated PG-13 for lots of partial nudity usually covered up withstrategically placed hair and flowers.  The film would be fine for kidsaround 11 and up. ","Midsummer Night's Dream, A",PG-13,1999,2.5
619,"         After the critically-trashed STARDUST MEMORIES, Woody Allen made a movie that's not too much better. A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY is a departure from the usual nihilistic, depressing comedy Woody produces, a whimsical period-piece comedy that has Woody's character an optimistic believer in the spirit world and, even more unlikely, married. Woody and his wife, Mary Steenburgen (who would move on to a man with an even bigger bald spot), are greeting two pairs of guests to their country home for a weekend of various forms of lust and fornication.          Aging college professor Jose Ferrer is engaged to Mia Farrow (in her first of fourteen consecutive Allen films), while promiscuous dentist Tony Roberts has brought horny nurse Julie Hagerty (who worked this movie into her schedule between AIRPLANE! and AIRPLANE II: THE SEQUEL). Three couples in all, but naturally none of the men are particularly interested in their respective lovers. Woody wants Mia, Jose wants Julie and Tony has already bagged Mary.          All three of the men are after Mia -- Jose because he's marrying her, Woody because he regrets not sleeping with her years ago when he had the chance and Tony because he falls in love with her at first sight. Meanwhile, Jose tries to talk Julie into being his last fling before his marriage to Mia and Mary tries to reignite the passion into her marriage with Woody. Although sex-obsessed, the movie never leaves the realm of the PG-rated, which makes sense because it's rated PG.          A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY moves a lot more slowly than the average Allen feature and is a lot less funny than usual because the Woody character is toned down from a cynical bastard to a spiritist inventor. Scenes where he's on the flying bicycle and especially the ending make the movie more absurd than funny, and aside from the basic premise of the movie, there's not much plot, just people trying to flirt and set up secret meetings that invariably backfire, and backfire is pretty much what this movie does after the first hour or so. ",Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,PG,1982,2.5
620,"      MIGHTY APHRODITE is an innovative, funny, but slow Woody Allencomedy that Woody wrote, directed, and stars in.  In the movie, LennyWeinrib (Woody Allen) is a sportswriter married to an up and coming artgallery manager and would be owner, Amanda Sloane (HelenaBonham-Carter).  Amanda is an attractive young wife, and Lenny is anolder, frail husband with thinning hair, pale skin and millions oflines in his face.  From the very beginning there is no chemistrybetween the two leads, but the audience is supposed to assume thatthere once was.  Amanda is obsessed with getting her own gallerywhereas Lenny is content hanging out with his sports pals talking aboutboxing and basketball.       When Amanda announces that she wants a baby but through adoptionsince she does not want to undergo the inconvenience of pregnancy,Lenny is upset.  He says, ""Adopt.  What.  I don't want to adopt.  Notwith my genes.  I have award winning genes.""  Given how old andunhealthy Woody appears in this movie, these lines bear a specialpoignancy.       Soon they adopt a baby (Max), and by age 5 he is clearlybrilliant.  Max and his father converse a lot.  In one of theseinterchanges, Max asks, ""Who is the boss between you and mommy?""  Lennytaking offense, replies, ""Who is the boss?  You have to ask that?  I'mthe boss.  Mommy is only the decision maker.""       Max's intellectual capacity sends Lenny off in a quest to findMax's real mother since Max's father is dead.  Lenny wants to knowMax's true lineage.  Not surprisingly, the mother (Mira Sorvino fromBARCELONA and BLUE IN THE FACE) turns out to be less that Lenny hadhoped.  He finds Max's mom is a porn star turned hooker who has manynames, some unprintable, but as a prostitute, she is now known as LindaAsh.  She comes from a family full of serial rapists, drug pushers, andworse.       Lenny decides to take care of Linda and even attempts to arrange arelationship with her and one of his young fighter friends, Kevin(Michael Rapaport).  Lenny believes that given their good lookscombined with an equal lack of intelligence they are made for eachother.  Linda in her crazy high pitched voice says at one point, ""I'mnot religious either.  Both of my folks were Episcopalians.""  Kevin isso dumb he can barely even construct a full sentence.  Together theirIQs would not add up to more two digits.       The innovative part of MIGHTY APHRODITE is a Greek chorus thatappears frequently to give Lenny advice.  The Greek chorus (Dick HymanChorus) is lead by F. Murray Abraham and has Danielle Ferland asCassandra.  The chorus is dressed in traditional robes and masks (byJeffrey Kurland) and is shown in an ancient Greek amphitheater.Sometimes they start off with parts of what appears to be an Euripidesplay, but soon they are speaking vintage Woody with words like""unthunk"" and bursting into song (including ""When you're smiling"") anddance.  For me, the chorus is one of the highlights of the show.  It isa fresh approach that is a lot of fun.  One of my favorite charactersin the movie is Cassandra and her best piece of dialog is ""I seedisaster.  I see catastrophe.  Worse, I see lawyers!""  Another time,the chorus calls on the great god Zeus to get advice, but gets hisanswering machine instead.       The problem with MIGHTY APHRODITE is that it is like a firstgrader learning to read.  He pronounces each individual letter slowlyyet is unable to form them into a word.  Here the dialog is great inpockets, but there are no characters to care about to keep theaudience's interest in between humor.  There are four or more putativelove stories in the movie, but none of them are believable.  Theseproblems are mainly with Woody's direction and script, but the actorsown some of the blame.       Rapaport is pathetic and delivers a caricature of a dumb boxer.He is an actor from MONEY FOR NOTHING and other films where he has yetto demonstrate he has the chosen the right career path for himself.Maybe he can box?  Sorvino gave a fairly good performance as anairhead, but Nicole Kidman in TO DIE FOR shows how this role can bedone much better.  The biggest disappointment for me was HelenaBonham-Carter (from many movies, but my favorite is LADY JANE).  Herlove interest in fellow art gallery owner Jerry Bender (Peter Weller)could have been much better developed and could have provided some realtension and actual romance in the movie.  Instead, most of the show isplayed only for the cheap laughs.  A real opportunity missed.  Finally,Woody is Woody, but a tired and sad looking Woody.       The sets by Santo Loquasto are pretty outlandish.  The hooker'sapartment is decorated as a garden of pornographic kitsch.  Thecinematography (Carlo DiPalma) is straightforward with the exception ofone wonderful scene at night of Lenny and Amanda in a New York Citytaxicab.  Lenny is unhappy with his marriage, and he looks at anattractive and happy couple nearby with melancholy and wistful eyes.These brief images form the best scene in the show.       MIGHTY APHRODITE only runs 1:30, but if the editor (Susan Morris)had done a little tighter editing, perhaps she could have prevented theshow from dragging so often.  The movie is rated PG-13 for extremelyexplicit references to all kinds of bizarre sexual behavior.  There isno nudity or violence.  The movie would be probably okay for matureteenagers, but the dialog is laced with pornographic movie qualityrhetoric.  For a great Greek chorus and for a lot of good laughs, Igive MIGHTY APHRODITE a mild thumbs up, but I was disappointed by it.It had the potential for so much more.  It gets ** 1/2 in my book. ",Mighty Aphrodite,R,1995,2.5
621,"      MILK MONEY has a lot going for it.  It has two stars I like,Melanie Griffith and Ed Harris, and has an interesting plot.  If youhave seen the trailers, you know it has a lot of good comedy.       On the other hand, this is a schizophrenic movie.  It can not makeup its mind if it is a movie for the early teen set or its targetaudience is grownups.  Every time the script starts to click in onedirection, it stops entirely and switches.  You get to like the movieand you start laughing, and then it enters another slump almost as ifit is scared to follow through with the courage of its convictions ineither direction.       The movie is about a little boy, well played by Michael Carter,and his 7th grade friends.  They hire a hooker, played poorly byMelaine Griffith.  Carter tells his Dad, played okay by Ed Harris, thatGriffith is their math tutor.  There is then a gag that runs throughalmost all of the show where Harris talks to Griffith about herprofession thinking she is a math tutor while she thinks he knows sheis a hooker.  This part of the plot works very well and produces a lotof laughs.       Notice in the show that Harris is shorter than Griffith.  This isnot unusual, but normally, they are careful with the camerawork to maskthe difference by the direction of the shots.  Here it is okay to be ashorter man.  Even the kids in the show have girlfriends taller thanthem.  I especially liked this aspect being to some extent a heightchallenged male.       Much of the show is devoted to a romance between Harris andGriffith which is not played in a believable fashion, and there is noreal chemistry between them.  There is another boring and unnecessarysubplot about bad guys wanting to find Griffith.  This subplot seems tobe from another movie and to have gotten stuck in this script bymistake.       Worst of all is the depiction of what it is like to be a singleDad.  It depicts cliches of single Daddydom whereby the son and Dadmicrowave TV dinners for 100% of their meals and always race, stopwatchstyle, to see who can gobble down their dinners the fastest.  The Daddyhas no clue on how to find a woman to date until the kid brings himone.  Oh yes, and of course, the Dad is also an environmentalist tryingto save part of the world.  Chaining himself to his car to save a swampis certainly the low point of the movie.       I had a pretty good time at the movie since much of the comedypart did work, but I should point out that if you have seen thetrailers, you have seen half of the jokes already.  I can not bringmyself to actually recommend MILK MONEY, and I give it **.  It runs1:50 and is rated PG-13 for a little bit of profanity.  Actually, Ithink that kids around the 7th grade area would probably get a kick outof the show and for that age group alone, I would give it a mild thumbsup. ",Milk Money,PG-13,1994,2
622,"      Like its closest ancestor, the ALIEN series, the new film MIMIC bywriter and director Guillermo Del Toro is as stunning visually as it isfrightening.  The film even has a heroine, Dr. Susan Tyler who, likeRipley, comes face-to-face with the lead monster in the end, but thistime the key to the survival of the monster species is a male.       In her first major non-comedic role, Academy Award winning actressMira Sorvino, last seen in the delightful comedy ROMY AND MICHELE'SHIGH SCHOOL REUNION, plays Dr. Susan Tyler, ""the bug lady.""  Sorvino,who seemed incapable of playing anyone with an IQ above 80, proves thather talent is much broader than expected.  Her Susan, while not near astough as Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, is quite strong even though she isvulnerable and scared.  Susan is also embarrassed because it is herscientific miscalculation that unleashed a plague of giant cockroachmutants on the world.  (This is one of those good shows -- SLING BLADEwas another -- which will immediately be written off by many people assoon as the plot is described.  Afterall, not many moviegoers go to theentertainment section looking for a good cockroach film.)       Cinematographer Dan Laustsen is a master at the art of the shadow.The shadowy mood combined with the script's proper sense of timing --the best monster movies delay our first complete view of the monster aslong as possible -- yields a film that builds its terror properly.Just as some of the sexiest films are those in which the people stayfully dressed but seem always on the verge of taking off their clothes,so it is with monster movies, the tease is the key.  In the entirefirst hour of MIMIC, the monster, in the form of a shadowy figure of aman in a cloak, is seen only in glimpses.  Marco Beltrami's eerie andforeboding music adds to the ever-present feeling that death is rightaround the corner.       ""Strickland's Disease came to our town like a thief in the night,threatening a generation of our children,"" Dr. Peter Mann (JeremyNortham) tells a large assembly of reporters.  Peter, a C.D.C. (Centerfor Disease Control) researcher and Susan's live-in lover, gives thisspeech praising Susan.  Two years earlier a disease, transmitted bycockroaches was killing kids even more than polio did in the 1950s.Her DNA-based solution was to create a vicious ""Judas Breed"" ofcockroach that would kill out the disease carrying cockroaches, butbeing infertile, the Judas Breed would themselves die within sixmonths.  Since the kids stopped perishing, the program was thusdeclared a huge and complete success.       Almost all of the story happens three years later, and -- youguessed it -- the Judas Breed did not die out, but instead mutated intosomething dastardly and human-sized.  Of course, at first we don't knowthat for sure.  But, when the C.D.C. researchers find excrement stuckto the ceiling where people died and when they break the mess open tofind large buttons in it, this is a definite hint that all is not rightin The Big Apple.       As in all horror films, people do stupid things.  Even whenfearsome creatures may be lurking, they work in darkened rooms lit byonly a single bulb.  In fact the light of flickering bad florescentlights and low-wattage incandescent bulbs adds dramatically to thehorrific ambiance.  Figures in the background are seen, but escape justbefore being noticed as the audience whispers a collective ""look out!""under their breath.       F. Murray Abraham appears in an inconsequential role as an expertnamed Dr. Gates.  He reflects, rather philosophically, on an insect'sinner motivation.  ""Can I eat it or will it eat me?"" it turns out iswhat those little critters are always thinking.  And do our big bugsever eat: children, pets, big beefy men, you name it.  The fright,however, does not come from visual gore since most meals are savoredoff-screen.  The fear comes in knowing what happens.       Charles Dutton appears as the street-wise -- actually subway-wisesince most of the film happens in and below the New York City subway --cop named Leonard.  He is great as the tough and disbelieving officerwho wants to play everything by the book.  There is even a boy with aheightened sense of hearing who calls the big bug, ""Mr. Funny Shoes""for the sounds he makes.       While the picture is certainly frightening, it is even morefascinating.  MIMIC has just enough scientific underpinnings to makethe story interesting and not seem too ridiculous.  The ending,although predictable in its outcome, has several surprises that usealmost plausible scientific theories.  MIMIC is an ALIENS set in ourtime and with a terrific look that begs to be seen even though thepotential for fright is ever-present.  One thing is certain.  Afterseeing it, you will look at street grates in a totally different way.       MIMIC runs 1:44.  It is rated R for terror and a little profanity.The show would be fine for teenagers who can handle horror flicks.  Irecommend the picture to you and give it ***. ",Mimic,R,1997,2
623,"Sandra Bullock, as FBI field agent Gracie Hart, is nothing short ofincredible in MISS CONGENIALITY by director Donald Petrie (MYSTIC PIZZA).With large, messy dollops of self-deprecating humor, Bullock makes herselfinto a real slob.  And then in this Pygmalion story, she is transformed intoa beauty who is still sometimes a crude klutz no matter how glamorous sheappears.  Tapping inner reservoirs of comedic talent that even her fansprobably weren't aware of, Bullock hits every joke out of the park like sheis Mickey Mantle at a Little League game.   Since this film is easily Bullock's best since SPEED, one can hope that thishilarious charmer won't get buried in an avalanche of holiday releases andthat moviegoers who aren't in the mood to watch Tom Hanks converse with avolleyball will give themselves the holiday treat of MISS CONGENIALITY. When we first meet the feisty Gracie (played when young by Mary AshleighGreen), she is a girl of about 11 who puts up with no guff on theplayground.  Standing up for the downtrodden and for herself, she slugsanyone who doesn't play fair.  Rather than appreciate her spunky defenses,kids shun her.   We cut to the present, in which Gracie (Bullock) has grown up to be a ""DirtyHarriet"" type of agent.  On the bureau's practice mat, she can take down anymale agent in a heartbeat, but she is a loner and a workaholic. Most lacking in Gracie is any sign of grace.  She approaches eating with thefinesse of a lioness gnawing on a fresh kill.  Her laughs are snorts, andshe hasn't a clue as to the purpose of napkins.  The side-splittingly funnyscript by Marc Lawrence (FORCES OF NATURE), Katie Ford and Caryn Lucasparcels out sharp lines to everyone, but saves some of the best for thestory's star.  Although known to love her beer and pizza, Gracie's passionruns to the fattening.  ""I'm going to get chip-faced,"" she tells hercoworker and temporary boss, Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt, RED PLANET), ata bar as she devours a whole pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. In her work, Gracie is known to be a screwup, even if she can run mentalcircles around everyone in her office.  When a serial killer leaves acryptic note threatening violence at the Miss United States Pageant, she isasked to go undercover as Miss New Jersey.  Since this is an honor shedreamed not of, Gracie initially says, ""No way!""  After all, she doesn'teven own a dress, and she views beauty contestants as pathetic airheads. The pageant's leader (Candice Bergen) and its master of ceremonies (WilliamShatner) can hardly believe their eyes when told that Gracie would make acredible undercover contestant.  Slouching in her chair and scrunching hermouth, Gracie would appear to be an absolutely hopeless candidate for amakeover.  Michael Caine is wonderful as Victor 'Vic' Melling, a beautycontest consultant called in to perform a miracle transformation.  Hisversion of Professor Henry Higgins and Bullock's version of Eliza Doolittleare delightful and original.  Watching Gracie stroll down the sidewalk, Victells her, ""Oh my God, I haven't seen a walk like that since JURASSIC PARK!""After he bans sweets from her diet, she keeps trying to smuggle donuts inher bra. When Gracie Hart is transformed into Gracie Lou Freebush -- a name ratherlike Pussy Galore from GOLDFINGER -- she becomes gorgeous.  In a skin-tight,short dress, Gracie looks like a million dollars.  But she's still the sameGracie underneath, so she frequently trips in her spiked heels and fallsflat on her face.  As she views a recording of previous awards ceremonies,Gracie mocks the mentally-challenged constants with the WIZARD OF OZ line,""If I only had a brain."" Once at the pageant, she makes friends with some of the ditzy dames, mostnotably Miss Rhode Island (Heather Burns, YOU'VE GOT MAIL).  Poor Miss RhodeIsland can't even answer softball questions.  When asked about her favoritedate, her reply is not dinner, dancing or any other activity but simply""April 25""? Probably the easily part of a beauty pageant to spoof is the ""talent""contest.  What is surprising about MISS CONGENIALITY is how they manage tocome up with humor about the talent contest that is not only funny but freshas well.  Too bad real-life pageants aren't this much fun.  If they were,then maybe the World Wrestling Federation might want to form a beautypageant subsidiary. MISS CONGENIALITY runs 1:40.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual references and ascene of violence and would be fine for kids around 9 and up. My son Jeffrey, age 11, laughed hard and often and gave the film *** 1/2.He found the movie imaginative, especially the paint scene.  He liked theway that Gracie's character develops, and he thought Sandra Bullock's actingwas great.",Miss Congeniality,PG-13,2000,2.5

Too bad, then, that""The Missing"" overstays its welcome by at least fifteen minutes. Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett) is a single mother living on thesparsely populated open lands of the New Mexico frontier, circa 1885.When her lover, Brake Baldwin (Aaron Eckhart), is brutally murderedand mopey teenage daughter, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood), is kidnappedby a dangerous Aztec mystic named Chidin (Eric Schweiger) who plansto sell her over the Mexican border, Maggie will go to any lengthnecessary to save her. Those lengths turn out to be more painful thanexpected, however, as she must seek help from her estranged father,Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones), who abandoned her family twenty yearsearlier to become an Indian. With tough younger da ughter, Dot (JennaBoyd), in tow, Maggie and Samuel set out on a trek across New Mexicoto put a stop to Chidin and save Lilly before it is too late. The prerelease ads and trailers for ""The Missing"" have misleadinglybilled it as more of a supernatural thriller than a conventional western.If you can get past the fact that its supernatural elements are basicallybeside the point and its thriller aspect only comes from the horrorinvolved in a mother losing her daughter to what are essentially agroup of pimps, what you will find is a western adventure that maynot be terribly original, but hits enough involving emotional chordsto be worthwhile. The setup of the driving plot is its highlight section,as Maggie suddenly finds herself having lost a loved one and mustrisk losing Lilly, too, if she does not find a way to find her beforethe captors reach Mexico. The atmosphere-drenched cinematography,by Salvatore Totino (2002's ""Changing Lanes""), is simply glorious,painting the untouched soils of the New Mexico forests and canyonsas a rapturous character in and of themselves. Cate Blanchett (2001's ""The Shipping News"") brings a fierce energyand reluctant vulnerability to her role of Maggie Gilkeson, who notonly suffers the blow of having her daughter snatched from her, butis reunited with a father who abandoned her years ago and whom shehas no interest in rekindling a relationship with. The anger and resentmentBlanchett projects toward Samuel is palpably felt throughout, andthe way in which they gradually attempt to put their differences behindthem is the true centerpiece of the picture. Tommy Lee Jones (2003's""The Hunted"") skillfully portrays Samuel as a man who gave up hisfamily to become what he felt was right for himself, but now, yearslater, feels guilt over what he put his family through. Jenna Boyd (2003's ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star"") brings matureconviction to her impressive performance as Maggie's younger daughter,Dot, while Evan Rachel Wood (remarkable in 2003's ""Thirteen"") hasless to do as Lilly, mostly seen as the helpless victim throughoutthe picture. Finally, as lead villain Chidin, Eric Schweiger makesfor a memorably threatening, even scary, presence. As ""The Missing"" passes the two-hour mark, interest ultimately beginsto lag. The film breaks up its shoot-out climax into three separatesequences, each one less powerful than the last. Had Chidin been theonly foe, rather than surrounded by a bunch of disposable henchmen,this problem may have easily been solved. After all, Chidin is thesol e villainous character with any sort of consequence to the viewer.Other extraneous scenes also could have been cut in the second halfwithout losing anything of real importance, while the very seriousmatter of Maggie's rape is too safely washed over and not touched upon again. At 130 minutes, ""The Missing"" seems much longer than it even is. Stayingwith it throughout its slower patches, however, proves to be a mostlyrewarding experience. Director Ron Howard appreciatively does awaywith the maudlin sentimentality many of his earlier films have fallenvictim to, and he proves to adeptly know his way around the westerngenre. The final scene between Maggie and Samuel hits a particularlypalpable note, concluding their troubled relationship with the rightamount of emotional closure and understandable opened ends. ""The Missing""may not be a standout western for modern day audiences, but it isundoubtedly a step in the right direction.","Missing, The",PG,2003,2.5
625,"Sometimes excessive, but fairly consistently good director BrianDePalma (CARRIE, DRESSED TO KILL, SCARFACE, BODY DOUBLE, THEUNTOUCHABLES, and CARLITO'S WAY) takes a TV classic and brings it toyour local monsterscreen.  As the movie going public now knows,megastar and suburb actor Tom Cruise plays point man Ethan Hunt inMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  The film has Cruise's usual good acting, someexcellent stunts (actually done by Cruise), and many effective uses ofthe TV theme music (Lalo Schifrin) with its heavy beat, but for me thefilm was a disappointment.  Although I think the film is worth seeing,much of the script (Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz, David Koepp, and RobertTowne) is plodding and tedious.       The plot of the story is that the IM force (Jon Voight as JimPhelps, Emmanuelle Beart as his wife Claire, Kristin Scott Thomas asSarah Davies, Emilio Estevez as Jack, and Ingeborge Dapkunaite asHannah) is supposed to foil the theft of a list of our covert agents inEastern Europe, but things do not turn out as the IM force would like.This puts them on a big cat and mouse game where it is not clear whoare the bad guys, and who are the good until the end.  There may or maynot be a mole.  It's that sort of story.       We also have Vanessa Redgrave as Max, Henry Czerny as CIA agentKittridge, Ving Rhames as ex-IMer Luther Stickell, and Jean Reno asex-IMer Krieger.  Evil seeming, but is he really, Kittridge gets lotsof overwritten lines like, ""If you want to play with the devil, that'sfine with me.  I just want to make sure you do it in hell.""  Jim Phelpsgets similar lines including the Biblical one of, ""thou shall not covetthy neighbor's wife.""       I have already said that Cruise is consistently good in all of hispicture including this one.  Most of the other IM actors have a lot oftalent, but I didn't see much of it in evidence in this movie.  JonVoight has not given a convincing performance since RUNAWAY TRAIN(1985), but the potential remains.  Emmanuelle Beart is absolutelywonderful in the just about to be released in the US, NELLY ANDMONSIEUR ARNAUD.  Kristin Scott Thomas was brilliant in RICHARD IIIearlier this year.  Emilio Estevez specializes in poor performances interrible movies like THE MIGHT DUCKS, but can be good as in REPO MAN(1984).  Only Ingeborge Dapkunaite have I never seen before.       Other than Tom Cruise's excellent acting ability and body, theonly reason to see the show are the action sequences.  They do nothappen that often and some, as in the computer room, are mercilesslyslow, but most are fresh and fascinating.  The best is thequintessential chase on top of a train.  Here they decide to do it onthe super fast French TGV and add enough elements to make itfascinating and unusual.  If the script had created characters I caredabout, which it didn't, then I would have been more impressed by thisscene because I would worry that someone would get hurt.  Anotherexcellent action sequence has to do with a blown fish tank.       Technically, the shows a few realistic aspects like the usergroups on the Internet (only alt.stuff and sadly notrec.arts.movies.reviews) and adds on a lot of outlandish technologylike a computer console in a sealed room that has an unbelievablycomplex security system guarding it.  Suspending disbelief and goingalong with this was no problem for me.  It is close enough to reality,and this is like a James Bond film anyway.       MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE runs 1:50.  It is correctly rated PG-13 asthere is no sex, no nudity, a little bloody but cartoon level violence,and fairly mild language.  It would be fine for kids say 9 and up.  Iwas disappointed by the way the show drags a lot, but the action isgood as is Cruise so I give it a thumbs up and award it ** 1/2. ",Mission: Impossible,PG-13,1996,2

Tom Cruise plays special agent Ethan Hunt who'srecruited from a rock-climbing vacation in Utah for a new,globe-hopping mission by his IMF contact, Anthony Hopkins. His teamconsists of a computer genius, Ving Rhames, and a beautiful thief,Thandie Newton. Their target is a terrifyingly destructive super-fluvirus. The deadly virus and its antidote were stolen from BiocytePharmaceuticals in Sydney, Australia, by a bitter, formidableIMF-agent, Dougray Scott, who threatens to ignite a worldwideplague. To achieve his goal, Tom must not only overcome all thephysical obstacles that Scott tosses his way but also his ownemotional turmoil when he realizes that he and Scott are both in lovewith the same woman.  ""That could be difficult,"" says Tom. ""This isn't'Mission Difficult',"" retorts Hopkins. ""It's 'Mission Impossible.'Difficult should be a walk in the park!""

627,"Americans like to think about their nation as the bestpossible embodiment of noble democratic ideals like libertyand equality and shining example for other, less fortunatepeoples. But for the most of its relatively short existenceUSA was as far from those ideals as some totalitarianregimes. At least you would get that impression if you lookat American history from the perspective of blacks,especially those who remember times when they wereinstitutionally barred from exercising their most basichuman and civil rights. Struggle to erase that shameful spotfrom the face of American democracy was anything but easyand many areas of USA witnessed violence, bigotry and hateusually associated with seemingly less enlightened placeslike Northern Ireland, Rwanda or former Yugoslavia. One ofthe films that captures the atmosphere of fear and violencein southern parts of USA during those times is MISSISSIPPIBURNING, 1988 thriller directed by Alan Parker.  Plot of the film is loosely based on the real events thattook place in state of Mississippi in summer of 1964. Threecivil rights activists - two whites and one black - tookpart in a campaign to educate black population about theirvoting rights and encourage them to exercise them, thusthreatening all-white racist power establishment. One nightall three of them are murdered by group of local racists.Few days later, FBI sends two agents to investigate theirdisappearance. The lead investigator is young, idealisticAlan Ward (played by Willem Dafoe) and he wants to solve thecase by employing methods from FBI manuals. But theconventional criminal investigation, even when aided bydozens of other agents or hundred of Navy reservists doesn'tyield any significant results. The main reason why theycan't find the bodies or evidence is in the wall of silencecreated by local population - whites are inimical towardsFBI, while the blacks are intimidated by KKK. Ward's partnerRupert Anderson (played by Gene Hackman) grew up inMississippi and knows the local ways, so he suggest use ofunconventional and sometimes downright illegal methods inorder to solve the case. Suspecting that the local sheriffRay Stucky (played by Gaillard Sartain) had something to dowith the murder, he finds a weak spot in local hairdresserMrs. Pell (played by Frances MacDormand), who providedcrucial alibi for her husband, Stucky's deputy Pell (playedby Brad Dourif).  MISSISSIPPI BURNING is good example how the same film can beseen differently by different people. While director AlanParker probably thought of his film as anti-racist aspossible, there were people who criticised film for beingcrypto-racist. Their main argument was in Parker's decisionto portray the brutal reality of 1960s South from theperspective of two white characters. As a result, blackAmericans are portrayed as nothing more than helplessvictims who can't fight for their rights by themselves andmust rely on noble whites to rescue them from their misery.Parker also had to endure additional criticism for strayingfrom the real history. However, his screenwriter ChrisGerolmo should be forgiven for not being faithful to thefacts of the case - real life seldom provides material thatwould work as great drama without some creativeintervention. So, here we have the usual cliche of allpolice films - two detectives who are different intemperament and methods. Gerolmo also allows some of 1980smentality to influence his script - it is implied that thebest way to fight evil is to beat it in its own game and useviolent methods without any concern for civil rights and dueprocess. The semi-romantic subplot between Anderson and Mrs.Pell also seems somewhat contrived, although Gene Hackmanand Frances MacDormand have excellent chemistry together.  However, despite the problems with authenticity and arguablytoo patronising view on 1960s blacks, MISSISSIPPI BURNING isstill very powerful film. Parker knows how to manipulateemotions of the audience. This is especially so in thenumerous but always heart-wrenching scenes of blacks beingvictims of beatings, torching and lynching. Those sceneswould leave a lasting impression on the audience, especiallyamong those who start thinking about this horror being partof everyday life in pre-1960s South. Those scenes alsoexplain why blacks in this film happen to be nothing morethan helpless victims and why this sad reality enjoys tacitsupport of some whites who might not like it, but feel thatthey haven't got any other choice but to support culture ofsemi-institutional racial violence. After being subjected tothese scenes, the audience is going to cheer for ourprotagonists when they finally give the racist monsters thetaste of their own medicine. Parker, apart from using thetalents of Gene Hackman in one of his best roles and wholevariety of great American character actors (Brad Dourif isespecially effective as pathetic little racist who embracedKKK as a way to hide his own weakness), also showed greattalent for authentic locations. Unfortunately, theatmosphere of the film is somewhat compromised by not veryinspired original music by Trevor Jones.  MISSISSIPPI BURNING is nevertheless a very good film that,despite its shortcomings, should be viewed as a warning andconstant reminder how some truths that we think asself-evident are far from being shared by large amount ofpeople. And effect of this film is even stronger when weremember that the this slice of American near past isnothing but the tragic present and even more disturbingfuture in many other areas of the world. ",Mississippi Burning,R,1988,3
628,"      MIXED NUTS, which originally had the title of LIFE SAVERS untilthat title tested poorly, is the latest Steve Martin movie.  In MIXEDNUTS he runs a crisis prevention center called Life Savers.  People whoare about to shoot themselves call the center as do terminally illpatients, men in drag, lonely people and, of course, ha ha, people whojust want to talk dirty.       Oops, I forgot to tell you a key fact; theoretically, this is acomedy.  Their brand of humor is created by shouting at each other, byproviding loud music that tries to put you in a laughing mood, and byhaving numerous sight gags.  A typical sight gag is peoplerollerbladding down the street carrying a Christmas tree between them.An irritated boyfriend then runs into them and knocks the tree over.Boy, that one sure put me in stitches.       In order to give you a proper grasp of the scale of the quality ofthe script (written by the director Nora Ephron), let me provide youwith the very best piece of writing in the whole movie.  Steve Martincalls his girl friend, and she tells him she is breaking up with himsince she has been dating someone else for 4 months.  She thencomplains that she wanted to tell him, but ""I did not want to do itover the phone like this.  I wanted to fax you, but you don't even havea fax!""  As soon as your uncontrollable laughter has subsided afterreading that last sentence, you can continue reading this review.       There are other people in the show, and in fact, the movie isfilled with quirky characters.  I will not embarrass them by mentioningany of their names other than Juliette Lewis who was so bad that shedeserves a special mention.       The movie is set in Santa Barbara but the camerawork is so cutesythat it manages to make one of the loveliest towns in California justlook silly and dreary.       The director should be shot.  Surely when she watched the dailiesshe realized that all of the so called jokes were falling flat.  Thenagain, perhaps she did and that is why she had them start shouting ateach other and why she added the zippy soundtrack to makes us forgetthe ""plot"".  The producer should have gotten a different writer andprobably another director or better yet, he should have just given upon the whole project.       I think Steve Martin is the best comedic actor that there is.Nevertheless, he was pathetic in this movie.  I am such a big fan ofhis that I lay most of the blame on the character he was given.  IfEphron had just let Martin cut lose and ad lib some it would have madefor a much better time at the movies.       MIXED NUTS takes forever to finish but actually runs only 1:37.It is rated PG-13 which I agree with.  I recommend you avoid this showat all cost, and I give it 1/2 of a star because, although the moviewas a disaster from start to finish, at least it was more stupid thanoffensive.  [Finally, since you are all dying to know, the title MIXEDNUTS comes from the fact that the lead character's Dad was killed by atruck of mixed nuts - another memorable line.] ",Mixed Nuts,PG-13,1994,0.5
629,"      Okay admit it, when you hear the title MOLL FLANDERS, you think ofthat racy novel from high school.  Yes, this is the same Daniel Defoebook, but an excellent director, Pen Densham, has made it into amarvelous character study and moving motion picture.  Certainly, MOLLFLANDERS can be a bit bawdy at times, but compared to most popularfilms today, the depiction of the sex here is tame.  This is cinema atits best: great actors, stirring music, impressive sets, and anintelligent script.       As the story starts, Hibble (Morgan Freeman from SEVEN, THESHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, DRIVING MISS DAISY, and GLORY among others) takesa little girl named Flora (Aisling Corcoran) out of an orphanage.  Itis his duty to read Flora the memoirs of her dying mother, MollFlanders (Robin Wright from FORREST GUMP),  whom she never knew.  Florais a saucy and high strung girl of about 7 who is more interested inescaping that hearing some silly old morality tale.  Hibble is just asdetermined that she will listen carefully to every single word of it.       As chronicled in her memoirs, Moll lead a miserable life.  Hermother was in prison to be hanged when she was raped by a guard.  Theypostponed the execution until the day Moll is born.  The script, whichI believe is a loose adaptation of the novel, stays with spirit of thebook and the cadence of the speech, but takes a lot of liberties.  Itpaints a Dickensian picture of the world that stretches credulity abit, but it was easy for me to suspend disbelieve.  I bought the storylock, stock, and barrel.       Moll comes to live in a religious school where the priests' fondleher and the nuns do not believe Moll's complaints.  She is a strongwilled young woman who defiantly proclaims, ""I'm not going to fear anyman of flesh and blood, no matter what costume he wears.""  Soon sheescapes from her hellish home and in an upbeat mood reflects that,""Hope comes to the young as naturally as the spring rains.""       Moll goes to work in the charitable home of Mrs. Mazzawatti(Brenda Fricker from A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE and MY LEFT FOOT), and theyattempt to teach her all of the social graces.  Mrs. Mazzawatti'sdaughters are anything but charitable, and Moll is forced to leave forquite surprising reasons that you will never be able to guess inadvance.       Moll is next taken in at a bordello runs by a conniving madamnamed Mrs. Allworthy (Stockard Channing from SIX DEGREES OFSEPARATION).  Hibble is Mrs. Allworthy's second in command.  Perhaps hewould be considered her butler.  At any rate, he and Moll eventuallybecome good friends.  At first Moll just cleans the floors at thebordello, and life is still hard for her.  She is beaten there as shehas been all of her life and will be more in the future.       After a while, Mrs. Allworthy's develops an affection for Moll andso give her some advice, ""Life's terrible short girl.  Give yourselfsome pleasure.  I'll bet you've never been kissed.""  Soon, she hasconvinced Moll the way to riches is through prostitution.  Mrs.Allworthy makes-up (make-up by Michele Burke) the naturally beautifulMoll to look like a circus clown and auctions off her virginity for onehundred guineas.  Moll tries to be optimistic about her life as a whoreconfiding with us that, ""I kept kissing frogs looking for a prince.""       After that her life and Mrs. Allworthy's take many turns some forthe better and some for the worse.  The story is wonderfully rich andvaried and always keeps the audience's attention.  After being beatenall of her life, she meets a gentle painter of anatomical drawingscalled The Artist (John Lynch).  His evil father is played by JeremyBrett from ""The Sherlock Holmes"" series on PBS as well as MY FAIR LADY(1964).  The painter hates his father and warns Moll that, ""Great moneydoes not a great human make.""       The ending of the film is somewhat of a surprise and is extremelyeffective and moving.  MOLL FLANDERS may produce a few natural tears.Although I cried a little toward the end, I never found the scriptmanipulative.       The acting was nothing short of brilliant.  It is hard to have afavorite in movies of this caliber.  If forced to choose, I'll go withMorgan Freeman's performance as the best.  This luminescent actor seemsincapable of anything less than a compelling performance.  Althoughthis is not his best film, he is great in it.       Technically the movie is on par with the high quality of theacting.  In fact, even better than the acting is the script by thedirector Pen Densham and the music by Mark Mancina.  The music has anextensive range from delicate and loving to large and dramatic.  Iwould be pleased to see this picture win many awards, but if I had topick one, I'd give it to Mark Mancina for the music.       The movie was filmed entirely in Ireland.  The dramatic sets(Caroline Hanania) and cinematography (David Tattersall) are gorgeous.The snowy scenes are bleak and yet possess an inner warmth somehow thussuggesting the possibility of hope around the next corner.  Thecostumes (Consolata Boyle) like the sets are lush and evocative withoutever being unbelievably ostentatious.  My favorite costume is thestern, long blue coat with the brass buttons that Hibble wears.       The director and the editors (Neil Travis and James R. Symons)demonstrate a flawless sense of timing.  The movie flows naturally andsometimes slowly, but always with enough energy so that you remain onthe edge of your seat.  Also the strong mood of the picture has to becredited to the director who is able to fashion just the right piecesto make it all come together.       MOLL FLANDERS is listed as running 2:49, but I think it might be amisprint.  Certainly it did seem that long.  However long it is, Iwould not want it edited down.  The film is rated R.  There is thebrutality of that era, but it is done tastefully.  There is brief sex,some nudity, but no bad language that I can remember.  It would be finefor any teenager and perhaps those a bit younger.  I give this show mytop recommendation and award it ****. ",Moll Flanders,NR,1996,4
630,"If you went to an out-of-town college during the Jurassic Age(1950's), as I did, you'll recognize what's on display in MikeNewell's classically styled film.  That the young women and theirArt History 100 instructor are types is not to take away too muchfrom the university-based drama, though what is disappointingis the lack of creativity a flaw that relegates ""Mona Lisa Smile""to the large bin of formulaic, Hollywood creations.  As I recallfrom my days at Tufts, which like the Wellesley College thatforms the background of Lawrence Konner and MarkRosenthal's story, the women at Wellesley were known to us asstuck-up (a term often used in the fifties) while those at Tufts'sister school, Jackson College, were rated overtly intellectual. We tended to prefer the down-to-earth residents of BostonUniversity .       Those in the audience who are under the age of sixty havelikely gained their knowledge of the Eisenhower years frommovies like Todd Haynes's ""Far from Heaven,"" which has thelook and feel of a Douglas Sirk soap, dealing with issues thatwere taboo to films of that very decade.  ""Mona Lisa Smile"" alsotreats some subjects freely discussed today though taboo then,but since the U.S. in 1953 was on the cusp of the women'smovement, those topics were embracing discussion a little morefreely, and what's more one independent-minded student inNewell's pic is conducting affairs with three different men andnot at all embarrassed about flaunting her choice.     ""Mona Lisa Smile,"" filmed by Anastas Michos at WellesleyCollege and at sites around Columbia and Yale, opens onKatherine Watson (Julia Roberts), heading into her first job asan instructor in Art History 100.  Politically liberal, she bumpshard against the culture of Wellesley which, despite its locationin the heartland of the progressive state of Massachusetts isbogged down in the regressive politics of the period.  Theschool is for women only, only white faces are on exhibit, andthe student body comes across as well-heeled to a fault.(Things are a lot different there now.)  During her first lecture-discussion, Katherine shows slides of art works dating fromprehistoric times and is surprised by the knowledge alreadypossessed by  a class, leaving her little slack to show her stuff. Surprisingly enough, Katherine realizes that these rich chargesof hers know quite a bit about what they are supposed to know.She is determined to challenge them by exhibiting somemodern art later demonstrating both Jackson Pollock, alsosome pop-art pictures to show the absurdity of a culture thatkeeps women ""in their place.""  For taking liberties with thecurriculum guide, she is hauled on the carpet by the schoolpresident.     The film scores in giving its audience an inkling of what aclass in art history is like.  Teacher shows slides, studentsdiscuss how style defines or subverts its historical period Latershe shows us how corporations have patronized andcondescended to the great works of the past by, in one case,devising a ""paint by the numbers"" game so that ""you too can beVan Gogh.""         Kirsten Dunst is nicely cast as the story's bitch, unhappy withher premature marriage to a guy who is probably philandering,taking her grief out on those of her classmates who appear mostvulnerable as well as publishing editorials in the school paperabout the shortcomings of the faculty, including the audacity ofthe school nurse in supplying diaphragms on demand to theyoung people.  Julia Stiles performs in the role of JoanBrandwyn, pushed by Katherine to apply to Yale Law School(which in 1953 allowed five spots for women in the incomingclass), but determined to chuck the chance for a career to bewith her man in Philadelphia (ugh).  Maggie Gyllenhaal is theschool's beatnik-to-be, carrying on three affairs including onewith a teacher of Italian.  Other types abound, including the shygal, Connie (Ginnifer Goodwin) who learns to stop being apunching bag, and Nancy (Marcia Gay Harden), as a teacher ofspeech, poise and homemaking (who helps convince Katherinethat she must actually be in a finishing school and not acollege).  The parts for men are all underwritten.     Julia Roberts can play this sort of role blindfolded,as speaking of punching bags the fifties are an era regularlybashed and Ms. Roberts does well as the woman who is goingto take her young women quickly into 1970.  Ultimately, though,""Mona Lisa Smile"" offers little to smile about.  Mike Newell,whose ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" exuded buoyancy andcharm in its depiction of a man who could not sustain arelationship, has regressed to a style that could have cut moreice on the British television of the 1950's in which he had ahand.  Newell is on record as a critic of what he calls thepretentiousness of some art-house fare, but in ""Mona LisaSmile"" he has gone too far in the opposite direction, giving us anicely composed but finally pedestrian work. ",Mona Lisa Smile,PG-13,2003,2
631,"There is a good movie hiding somewhere within ""Monkeybone,"" just breaking to get out. Equipped with an imaginative premise and occasionally eye-popping visuals of a world and creatures that have never been glimpsed before on the silver screen, this otherwordly fantasy should be alive with energy and originality, but it isn't. It is an empty, lethargic slug of a movie that creeps along with several good ideas, but does nothing with them.  Stu Smiley (Brendan Fraser) has created an offbeat cartoon known as ""Monkeybone"" that has just been picked up by the Comedy Channel. Not really interested in mainstream success, his career is, nonetheless, just about to take off. On his way home from a premiere party with his loving girlfriend, Julie (Bridget Fonda), whom he is about to propose to, they are involved in a freak car accident with an unwieldily balloon that leaves her unharmed, but Stu in a deep coma. From here on, Stu finds himself arriving in a fantasy world known as Downtown, inhabited by creatures big and small, including Monkeybone himself (voiced annoyingly by John Turturro). He soon comes to find that it is a netherworld in which he is to stay in until word comes whether he should be sent to Heaven or Hell, or return to his life and girlfriend. Meanwhile, back on Earth, it has been three months since the accident and Stu is showing no signs of progression. When his older sister, Kimmy (Megan Mullally), decides it is time to pull the plug on him, Julie plots to inject him with ""nightmare juice"" that she hopes will scare him out of his comatose state.  At just 87 minutes (including opening and ending credits), ""Monkeybone"" feels like an ambitious film that was destroyed by a directing and editing hack job. While the movie just barely makes sense, it is also clear that large amounts have been cut out, and to lethal effect. In Harry Knowles' scathing review at ""Ain't-It-Cool-News,"" he speaks of how the original screenplay, loosely based on a comic book called ""Dark Town,"" was an extravagant, brilliant piece of originality and wonder, and in the process of getting it to the screen, large amounts were edited out after a shaky test-screening, or never filmed at all, due to budget restraints. Knowing this, it can safely be said that ""Monkeybone"" may very well have once been a good motion picture, but has, instead, been turned into a lifeless, overblown monstrosity.  While the scenes set in Downtown are, indeed, a visual feast of gorgeous set decoration and production design, they always feel rushed, as we intermittently are taken back to the world of the living to follow Julie's plight. Because of this, there is no rhythm or natural flow to any of it, and its spare parts clank together like pieces of rusted metal. Not only that, but director Henry Selick (who fared much better with 1993's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and is making his live-action debut here) proves to not have a gift with human actors, as none of the characters are the least bit interesting, and hardly any of the actors give inspired performances.  To be fair, no one is given much screen time except for Brendan Fraser (1999's ""The Mummy"") and Bridget Fonda (1999's ""Lake Placid""), but even they seem distant throughout, as if their hearts simply weren't in on this production. Neither is given anything worthwhile to do, and their roles feel painfully rote. All of the other actors just struggle to appear onscreen at all, and each one of them is wasted. There seems to be promise in the friendly relationship between Stu and a half-cat/half-human named Kitty, played by Rose McGowan (2000's ""Ready to Rumble""), but something tells me most of her scenes found their way to the cutting room floor. Aside from the humorous initial reaction to see Whoopi Goldberg play Death, she is given nothing to do. The same goes for the highly talented and extremely funny Megan Mullally (TV's ""Will & Grace""), who isn't offered one funny line to utter. Only Chris Kattan (TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), as a recently deceased runner whose body is inhabited by Stu, stands out from the crowd, and successfully blends both physical comedy and drama. Unfortunately, his screen time is as brief as everyone else's.  ""Monkeybone"" is a very bad movie, and amazingly so. With a story so fresh and a world so promising, it almost feels as if the results were intentionally botched. Whatever the case may be, the finished product is far more dull and artificial than it has any right to be. It leaves you feeling frustrated and angry at everyone involved in its journey to the screen. ",Monkeybone,PG-13,2001,1.5
632,"Long time ago, the author of this review watched thedocumentary series COSMOS. In one of the episodes, itsnarrator, Carl Sagan, made an interesting experiment. Hecollected samples of all the chemical elements that createhuman body and mixed them all, trying to create a man. Ofcourse, it failed. Unfortunately, the authors of MONOLITHdidn't watch this particular episode, otherwise theywouldn't make a movie so utterly disappointing like thisone. Like Sagan, they had interesting elements forinteresting SF action thriller- good, or at least, capableactors; good special effects; few interesting action scenes- but they failed to connect them into coherent film.  The plot, like so many of them, takes place in Los Angeles.Tucker (played by Bill Paxton) and Terri Flynn (played byLindsay Frost) are pair of tough LAPD detectives that areinvestigating the murder of a small boy. The killer isemotionally disturbed scientist, but, before they can findout any motives for the killing, the suspect and all theevidence is taken over by Department of Historical Research,led by menacing Villano (played by John Hurt). Of course,Tucker and Flynn decide to investigate further, and theyfind a lot of violent incidents in the city - incidentsinvolving some malevolent alien force, capable of takingover human bodies. But, before they anything about it, theymust take care of Villano and his henchmen, who would stopat nothing to suppress the truth.  The concept of this film, although it resembles X-FILES(that had the first season in the same year), is actuallyvery unoriginal - some mean alien coming to Los Angeles andbeing unstoppable, until few dedicates members of LAPD takecare of him (like in I COME IN PEACE or HIDDEN). Thescreenplay by Steven Lister is awful - it simply doesn'tconnect the dots between obligatory action scenes, thecharacters are unappealing and wooden, and the plot containswholes with the size of Nebraska. Of course, there are somehuge implausibilities (like organisation called Departmentof Historical Research taking over murder suspects fromLAPD) that look like an insult to viewer's intelligence. IfLister and director Eyres made those mistakes deliberately,trying to turn this film into self-parody, they failed. Thefilm looks dead serious. Some actors, like Louis Gossett Jr.and John Hurt, are doing their work very well, but theycan't breathe life into bad and stereotypical roles. Paxtonand Frost are, on the other hand, totally deprived of anychemistry between the characters they play, either romanticor classic ""buddy buddy"" model. Some action scenes lookinteresting, but a lot of pyrotechnics and special effectswon't change the verdict on this film - MONOLITH is failedfilm that should be avoided. ",Monolith,R,1993,0.5
633,"Maturely directed by Marc Forster (2001's ""Everything Put Together""),""Monster's Ball"" is a stark drama filled with so much rage and despairit ultimately threatens to suffocate the hopefulness that truthfullyhangs around the edges of the story. Aided by two performances thatrank with the year's very best, and a screenplay that wisely overstepsmelodrama for sharp realism, it is nearly impossible to take youreyes off the screen for a second. One of the richest pleasures the film offers is its frequently unforeseendevelopments that makes much of what happens all the more captivating.To lightly move around the proceedings without giving anything vitalaway, Billy Bob Thornton stars as Corrections Officer Hank Grotowski,an overbearingly stern father living in the deep south who has pushedhis child, Sonny (Heath Ledger), into the same profession as he. LeticiaMusgrove (Halle Berry) is a down-on-her-luck single mother to an obese10-year-old son (Coronji Calhoun) who is struggling to come to termswith the recent execution of her convicted late husband (Sean Combs).Through a tragic, life-altering occurrence in both of their lives,Hank and Leticia find the greatest solace in meeting each other, asthey are two notably different people who suddenly have a lot in common. A thoughtful rumination on how hatred and bigotry have the power tobe passed down in a family, ""Monster's Ball"" is a shattering motionpicture that packs a wallop. Director Marc Forster masterfully usessparse, but important, dialogue exchanges, and moments of unflinchingsexuality and violence to tell a story of culminating optimism andredemption. Just as in the real world, unpredictable, unfair snagsmove into the lives of the characters throughout, and it is a testamentto natural human strength that helps them to feel, hurt, and finally move forward. Forster and screenwriters Milo Addica and Will Rokos also deserveplaudits in their uncompromising portraits of Hank and Leticia, twoflawed individuals whom we start off actively disliking, and thenslowly warm up to as they make changes in their life that can onlybe for the better. By the ending, it comes as something of a shockto discover how much we have grown to care about and respect them. Billy Bob Thornton (2001's ""The Man Who Wasn't There"") and Halle Berry(2000's ""X-Men"") are extraordinary in their roles. Thornton poignantlyportrays Hank as, at first, a man held captive by the years of brainwashinghis narrow-minded, racist father (Peter Boyle) has done to him and,later, as someone who recognizes his awful mistakes and sets out tomake them as right as they can possibly be.  Berry's Leticia is just, if not more, fascinating, as a woman whohas been hurt for too many years by her absent husband, and takesout her self-hatred on her overeating son. This is a remarkable achievementon Berry's part, and her highly charged, heartbreaking performance is worth noticing. As Sonny, Hank's abusively treated son, Heath Ledger (2001's ""A Knight'sTale"") cogently brings sadness and regret to a brief role that leavesa lasting impression. R&B musician Sean Combs (2001's ""Made"") breaksthe usual singer-turned-actor curse with the emotionally understatedsupporting part of Lawrence Musgrove, Leticia's husband, who on theverge of death with his impending execution. In the wrong hands, ""Monster's Ball"" could have easily been written,acted, and filmed in an obvious manner--predictable, maudlin, andneedlessly conventional. In the right hands of Forster, however, itis an important movie that digs deeply, and lovingly, into the darknessand possible light of human nature. ",Monster's Ball,R,2001,3
634,"It's a question of scale.  On an absolute scale, Pixar's MONSTERS, INC. isan imaginative, funny and beautifully computer generated film that's aterrific choice for the whole family.   The problem comes from comparison with all of the Pixar films (TOY STORY, ABUG'S LIFE and TOY STORY 2) that have come before it.  Relative to them,MONSTERS, INC. is a bit of a disappointment, being more thinly plotted andcontaining almost no memorable lines.  The lead characters are well drawn,but the others are just barely sketched in (double pun intended).   The movie starts quite well by providing a great warm-up act.  I'd call it acartoon except that it's really a computer animated short story.  Called FORTHE BIRDS, it is completely adorable, is fast paced and serves brilliantlyas the appetizer for another Pixar main course. The plot, as we all know, having seen the trailers about a million times,concerns the monsters who live in kids' closets and who come out to scarethem at night.  The monsters incorrectly believe that kids are toxic, so themonsters are much more scared of the kids than the kids are of the monsters. Monsters, Inc. is a company that is bottling kids' screams as a powersource.  The corporation's number one frightener currently is James P.'Sulley' Sullivan (John Goodman), who is aided by his wisecracking sidekickMike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).  Number two and closing in fast is the evilRandall Boggs (Steve Buscemi). One disastrous night, Sulley accidentally lets out a toddler, whom henicknames Boo (Mary Gibbs).  She goes through the portal from her room tothe monster's world.  The movie concerns Sulley's attempt to return her toher bedroom.  (Some may get a little queasy since the corporation sends outmen in decontamination suits, viewing Boo as something akin to a biologicalhazard.  Most kids won't notice.  It's their parents who may be a taduncomfortable.) Boo is a sweetheart who can barely talk.  Instead, she merrily babbles,cries and laughs.  Sulley, a big, green and purple monster, is a lovableteddy bear sort who treats Boo with a boundless reserve of love, kindnessand protection.  We should all be blessed with such monsters in our closets. The last act is easily the most fun.  In pursuit of Boo's door, we careendown a conveyor belt of doors, popping in and out of the human world.  It'slike a Disneyland ride -- and probably will be in the future.  The finalscene is a real charmer.  If I could just get the other three Pixar moviesout of my mind, I might really get excited about this movie. MONSTERS, INC. runs 1:24.  It is rated G and would be fine for all ages,with the possible exception of easily frightened kids under 5. My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ***, saying it was good and funny.  Therewith his seventh grade class, friends and relatives, most of the kids gavethe movie *** or *** 1/2.  Sam found it annoying and Noveed thought it wastoo cutesy, but most of the others were enthusiastic.  Typical was Caitlin,who thought the movie was ""really, really good.""  Several of the kidscompared it to SHREK, and those that did all liked SHREK a little better.",Monsters Inc.,G,2001,3.5
635,"Two narrative threads are woven here: 1) dealing with grief and 2)living a lie. The story, set in 1973, opens with a funeral in a smallMassachusetts town. JoJo and Ben Floss (Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman) aremourning their murdered daughter whose fianc_ Joe (Jake Gyllenhaal) wandersaimlessly. JoJo reacts angrily to condolences (""Why don't they think before theyspew?""), while Ben buries his pain in his work. Dazed and confused, Joe hasmoved in with his would-be in-laws and agreed to join Ben in commercial realestate. Briefed by their attorney (Holly Hunter), they're are awaiting thegunman's upcoming trial. But there are pesky details to deal with. Like thewedding invitations which Joe must retrieve from the local post-office. That'swhere he meets quirky, wise-cracking Bertie (scene-stealing Ellen Pompeo), whoruns a neighborhood bar owned by her fianc_ who's been M.I.A. for three years inVietnam. You can guess what happens when these two lost souls meet, but Joe isalso grappling with a dilemma. The Flosses don't know that he'd actually brokenhis engagement to their daughter just days before she was shot and that he'sstaying with them partly through a feeling of guilty obligation. When thatsecret is eventually revealed, there are aching, affecting, illusion-shatteringmoments for Sarandon, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal. Writer-director Brad Silberlingwas inspired by his own experiences following the 1989 murder of his fianc_e, TVactress Rebecca Schaeffer, so the grief rings true, although a subplot involvinga proposed mall seems perfunctory. Songs like the Rolling Stones' ""MoonlightMile"" imbue the soundtrack with nostalgia. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to10, ""Moonlight Mile"" is a bittersweet 7, a meditation on love, loss, grievingand moving on. ",Moonlight Mile,PG-13,2002,3
636,"One man's medicine is another man's poison. At least this is the conclusion you could draw after watching MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO, 1995 romantic drama directed by David Anspaugh. The plot of the film is based on 1989 autobiographical play by Ellen Simon, daughter of famous American playwright Neil Simon.  In it Ellen Simon tried to deal with her own grief for husband killed during jogging.   In the film Ellen Simon's alter ego is Rebecca Trager Lott (played by Elizabeth Perkins), woman who teaches poetry at one of New York's colleges. Her life is shattered with the news about her husband being killed while jogging. Rebecca must find a way to move on and in doing so she receives support from three other women, burdened with their own problems. Rebecca's best friend Sylvie Morrow (played by Whoopi Goldberg) fears that her husband is going to leave her. Rebecca's younger sister Lucy (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is troubled by virginity. Rebecca's stepmother and successful businesswoman Alberta (played by Kathleen Turner) can't get over the fact that Lucy and Rebecca still love their deceased mother more than her. In the meantime, Rebecca gets attracted to young and mysterious housepainter (played by Jon Bon Jovi).  MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO could have served Ellen Simon very well, but the filmmakers and audience weren't that lucky. Hollywood adaptation of the play looks exactly like those Hollywood products that have given bad name to phrases like ""chick flick"" and ""dramedy"". Characters are mostly uninteresting and live in fairytale world of American upper middle class, so far away from the average viewers in the theatres. Another problem is utter predictability of the plot - the audience won't have any problems guessing how the film ends and how characters are going to deal with their problems. But the biggest problem for MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO is its position in the limbo between drama and comedy - the subject is too serious for film to be taken as a comedy, while forced ""quirkiness"" of the characters take away its credentials of drama. Director David Anspaugh, torn between those two worlds, is unable to find proper direction for this film. The general impression of MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO is, on the other hand, salvaged by diverse and talented cast, among which Gwyneth Paltrow is the best, and rock star Jon Bon Jovi the most interesting actor. However, although MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO is watchable, the viewers would probably feel that the better use could have been found for that many talents. ",Moonlight and Valentino,R,1995,1.5
637,"Think of it as an eerie feature-length ""X-Files""/""Twilight Zone"" episode- this supernatural tale of a seven-foot tall, red-eyed, winged apparition whoforetells doom and destruction. Here's the background: in his 1975cult-thriller, John A. Keel claimed he experienced various paranormal events intiny Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1966-67 while writing about UFOs forPlayboy magazine so screenwriter Richard Hatem has adapted his story for thescreen. Richard Gere plays John Klein, an intrepid Washington Post politicalreporter whose wife (Debra Messing) drew mysterious sketches of a moth-likemonster she said she'd seen just before her death from a rare brain tumor. Twoyears later, when he's driving to Richmond, Virginia, Klein somehow winds up inPoint Pleasant, where his car breaks down in the middle of the night on a lonelycountry road. When he knocks on the door of a nearby house, he encounters aparanoid redneck (Will Patton) who aims a gun at him and accuses him ofharassment. Soon a local cop (Laura Linney) appears on the scene and she tellsKlein something strange is going on. Good, church-going people are experiencingcreepy, inexplicable things, including demonic voices from beyond that warn ofimminent disaster on the Ohio River, and a spooked scientist (Alan Bates)relates his experiences. None of this makes much sense but director MarkPellington (""Arlington Road"") uses extreme close-ups to maintain the tension andsuspense.

638,"They say that traveling broadens. I recall my own trip to theareas covered by the principals of ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" bydirector Walter Salles (""Central Station""). This was in 1967when I traveled with a group of 20 high school teachers whoreceived summer fellowships to zoom throughout the westernregions of South America. I came back from the trip withanecdotes for the classroom, a better-than-tourist's eye view ofthe area since we had lectures from prominent SouthAmericans, and had fun being with a group of like-mindedpeople_though like the two principals in this film we did notalways get along so well. Truth to tell, while I was able toenliven some high-school classes, particularly the honorstudents who at least pretended to be interested, my politicalwere not the spine of celluloid coming-of-age dramas Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Alberto Granado(Rodrigo de la Serna), though, were changed right down to thecore. Most of us older folks here in the States recall thatErnesto""Che"" Guevara was instrumental in helping Fidel Castro'srevolution in Cuba, which brought down the Fulgencio Batista. Yet we think, how could a guy from an upper-middle classhousehold in Buenos Aires, comfortably situated as a medicalschool student, be so radicalized to be the famous (or notorious)Che, whose icon is one of the one hundred most recognizable inthe world and is worn on T-shirts of mostly well-off kids here(who just may be rebelling against their families rather thanMotorcycle Diaries,"" based on two books_Guevara's ""TheMotorcycle Diaries"" and Granados's ""With Che Through LatinAmerica,"" will help greatly to see how Che Guevara, turned intoa violent revolutionary. However, I don't believe the principal aim of director Salles orscripter Jose Rivera is to give us an inkling of bourgeois turnedradical, but rather they provide us with a fleshed-out drama thatcould be put on the front burner of people whose favoritechannelis akin to National Geographic. It's a coming-of-age story, not ofthe usual teenagers or eight-year-olds who learn to make peace(or not) with their families but of two young men, Che at the ageof 23 and Alberto at the age of 29, whose rugged travels takethem from the urban contentment of Buenos Aires through thedesolate mines of Chile, and on north to the leper colony in SanPablo, Peru. Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal) is depicted as a serious fellowthroughout, making us wonder how such a stiff could form thebonds he did with the lumpen proletariat of western SouthAmerica_where Eric Gautier filmed them mostly on location inArgentina, Chile and Peru (with Colombia and Venezuela fit inwithin the last of those areas). Contrasted with the medicalstudent with but one term to go when he takes this sabbatical,Alberto, a biochemist, is a hale-fellow-well-met whose Jay-Leno-like appearance signals to us right off that this chap would bethe comic member of the duo. They travel together for the first eight months of 1952 on a1939 motorcycle which they ironically call The Mighty One andwhich breaks down not halfway to their goal but not until ElPoderosa visits a couple of nasty spills on the intrepid travelers. They avoid any road with the slightest similarity to the New YorkState Thruway or the Trans-Canada highway, zipping along theback roads not excluding Chile's Atacama desert. When theircontraption finally dies, they are able to persuade people alongthe way to help them with other forms of transport, includingtruck and raft, ultimately a flight on a cargo plane out of Caracaswhere Alberto remains to take a job in his field.The highlight of the journey is in a leper colony, mostmeaningful to Che because in school he majored in that field ofmedicine. As expected, they bond with the patients, the nuns,the nurses and the doctors there and in one situation, Ernestopersuades a reluctant patient to undergo surgery to save herarm. If you've ever traveled with a tour group_generally the mostcomfortable and thereby least challenging form ofexpedition_you may have noticed how after a few days or aweek, some folks simply do not get along with others and thecompany breaks up into cliques. It's all the most amazing thatAlberto and Ernesto, not necessarily sharing the same goals (forexample Alberto is a dancer while Ernesto is a stiff), remainedon friendly terms throughout, whether riding on the samemotorcycle, on a truck and a raft, sleeping in the same quarterswithout a break of a single night.

639,"      MOUSE HUNT, the first kids' movie from the new DreamWorks studio,should come with a warning.  Its PG rating may give a false sense ofsecurity to parents, but they may find their kids wanting to leaveearly as several around us did.  Later in the review I'll cover some ofthe picture's questionable aspects.       The dark movie opens with a funeral.  The father, Rudolph Smuntz,played just before his death by William Hickey, has died.  His grownsons, Ernie and Lars, played without much energy by Nathan Lane and LeeEvans, are carrying their father's casket.  When the brothers drop thecasket, the corpse comes flying out, which immediately began to scaresome of the kids around us.       The father, whose motto is ""a world without string is chaos,"" ownsa bankrupt string factory.  He bequeaths it and a heavily mortgaged,broken down house to his two sons.  The house is correctly described as""cold and spooky,"" and Phedon Papamichael's creepy, dark cinematographyadds to the fright.  (""Can we go now?"" asked the kid behind me, clearlyupset.)  Alan Silvestri's whimsical music tries to set a happier moodto the picture.       With a DOA performance by the two leads, the mouse shows up andalmost saves the picture.  His antics are delightful, and he is theonly one present with any intelligence.  When the brothers slice off apiece of cheese to put it on a mouse trap, the mouse rolls the entirecheese wheel away instead.  And when they hire a scary cat namedCatzilla, whose claim to fame is that he survived being gassed at thepound, even he cannot outsmart the mouse.       The broke brothers find out that, since their father's house wasdesigned by a famous architect, it can be sold for over ten milliondollars.  In an illogical fit of anger they slowly demolish their onlyvaluable possession in a vain quest to kill the pesky mouse.  The onlysmart thing they do is hire Caesar the Exterminator -- smart becauseChristopher Walken's militarily precise performance is the only decentone by a human being in the movie.  Looking like Robert De Niro in hisrole of Harry Tuttle in BRAZIL, Walken goes after the little critterwith gadgets and pseudo-sophisticated strategy.  Got to think like amouse to capture one, he explains.       The most imaginative sequence in the film has the mouse runningbehind the walls, chased by a series of nails being hammered into thewall.  As he is trapped between two nails with another about to shootthrough his eyes, he is saved at the last second.  Needless to say, thekids are apt to be to scared by this scene as it looks like the mouseis about to die a horrible death.       First-time movie director Gore Verbinski, whose background istelevision commercials, manages to maintain interest in the show'sblack comedy for about thirty minutes, but after that repetition setsin.  The mouse's acrobatics always delight, but banged heads have alimited appeal.       As promised, I'll cover some of the inappropriate parts of themovie.  First, the tone is extremely dark.  After opening with theburial of one person, they kill off another with a realistic scene inwhich an obese man eats a cockroach, throws it up and then dies of amassive heart attack.  My son refused to drink water after the movieuntil he inspected it for bugs.  In a particularly gross scene, theexterminator eats mouse feces as an investigative technique.       In the sexually questionable category are a series of fondlingsthat occur at the end.  When the mouse runs down a woman's dress, onebrother reaches his arm way down inside her dress with the appearanceof fondling her.  This causes her friend to grab the other brother'shand and put it down her dress so she can be fondled too.  And there isa similar scene when the mouse runs down a man's pants, and his brotherputs his arm in after it.  These scenes have no place in a PG moviewith a theater filled with young kids.  (I checked and was not able tofind any other reviewers who have mentioned the movie's questionableparts.  How can they be so oblivious to the sensibilities of themovie's target audience?  Don't any of the reviewers have kids?)       The movie ends in one of its few upbeat moments.  The endingpossesses the intelligent and good spirited humor that the rest of themovie so often lacks.       MOUSE HUNT runs 1:30.  It is incorrectly rated PG and should beconsidered questionable for kids under 10.       My son Jeffrey, age 8, spent most of the movie so scared that hewas shaking, but said he wanted to stay.  In the end he claimed hethought the movie was ""great and funny.""  He went on to say that hewanted to advise parents that ""if you don't like bugs or mice or bloodyscenes or if your child gets scared easily, don't see it.""  His friendMatthew, age 9, said the movie was ""a rich and cheesy deal, but it wasgood.""  Both of them said they liked HOME ALONE 3 much better becauseit had more action, was funnier and wasn't so gross. ",Mouse Hunt,PG,1997,2
640,"In his ongoing resume of comedic credits, Adam Sandler is known toalternate between outlandish characters with speech impediments (1998's""The Waterboy,"" 2000's ""Little Nicky"") and more down-to-earth guyswith hearts of gold (1998's ""The Wedding Singer,"" 1999's ""Big Daddy"").The latter category has always made for his more successful pictures,because the person Sandler is playing is more easily related to anddoesn't have to hide behind unctuous mannerisms. In ""Mr. Deeds,"" directedby Steven Brill, who last made the misfire ""Little Nicky,"" Sandleris back to form in a movie that has its share of over-the-top moments,but is likable for its underlyingly sweet love story. Ever since ""Mr. Deeds"" was announced as Sandler's next starring vehicle,cynical critics have chastised it for fear that it would tarnish 1936'sFrank Capra classic, ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" from which it is basedupon. Whether it does or does not do justice to its predecessor, 66years is more than enough time between films for it to not make anydifference whether this present-day remake stacks up. Viewed on itsown terms, ""Mr. Deeds"" is an occasionally, and purposefully, cornballcomedy whose jokes don't always work, but has an eager-to-please charmthat brightens up the rough patches. Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) is a happy-go-lucky owner of a pizzaparlor in the small, Norman Rockwell-ish town of Mandrake Falls, NewHampshire. When he is approached by Manhattan entrepreneur Chuck Cedar(Peter Gallagher) and informed that he will inherit $40-billion fromhis recently deceased uncle, whom he has never met, if only he sellshis share of Blake Enterprises over to the oily Cedar, Deeds agreesto accompany him back to New York City. Enter tabloid news reporterBabe Bennett (Winona Ryder), who poses as innocent school nurse PamDawson to secretly tape Deeds doing anything that could tarnish hisimage. While undercover, however, Babe comes to realize how wrongwhat she is doing to Deeds is and, what's worse, is actually falling in love with him. ""Mr. Deeds"" offers little of creativity or substance to its decades-oldstoryline and humor, but it does feature a romance that, for Sandler,is as gentle and effective as any of his movie pairings since DrewBarrymore in Sandler's easily best film, ""The Wedding Singer."" ""Mr.Deeds"" does not reach the lofty heights of that picture's adorablyjoyful love story, but Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder (2000's ""LostSouls"") are, nonetheless, charismatic both together and apart. Asthe affable Longfellow Deeds, Adam Sandler does not necessarily stretchhis acting muscles much (he basically plays the same character overand over), but he does inject the role with an undeniably fetchinginnocence. How wonderful it is to find someone of Winona Ryder's talentand stature cast opposite Sandler. While the part of Baby Bennettis well within her reach and not terribly challenging, Ryder sparkleswith a simple effervescence in performing she has lacked since 1994's ""Little Women."" The comedic element of the picture is more of the hit-or-miss variety.Some of the jokes are unfunny and lacking inspiration, including theongoing hijinks of the aptly named ""Crazy Eyes"" (Steve Buscemi) orthe musty jokes involving Deeds' black, frostbitten foot. On the otherside of the fence, screenwriter Tom Herlihy does cook up several outrageouslyfunny bits of lunacy, particularly a hilarious surprise visit to Pam'ssupposedly made-up hometown of Westchestertonfieldville, Iowa, andanother setpiece where Deeds must save a woman and her eight catsfrom a burning apartment building. Supporting Sandler and Ryder are John Turturro (2002's ""CollateralDamage""), as Deeds' foot fetishist butler; Erick Avari (2001's ""TheGlass House""), as Cedars' soft-sided associate, Cecil Anderson; andConchata Ferrell (2000's ""Erin Brockovich""), as Deeds' sassy friendand pizza place coworker, Jan. They all have memorable turns. OnlyPeter Gallagher (1999's ""American Beauty""), as the conniving ChuckCedar, is a downright bore. If ""Mr. Deeds"" isn't the funniest movie Adam Sandler has ever made,or the most original or tightly paced, it remains a charming one.Sandler and Ryder go through the paces of the predictable romance,but it works surprisingly well under the helm of these gifted performers.Moreover, the journey Ryder's Babe takes from hard-edged, ruthlessreporter to a more genuine, selfless human being adds some emotionalweight to a character who might otherwise have been underwritten.As an undemanding, yet engaging, story of two inherently good peoplewho turn out to be soulmates, ""Mr. Deeds"" is a solid diversion. Sandlerfans, especially, will eat it up.",Mr. Deeds,PG-13,2002,2
641,"      MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is the classic fictional story about a teacherwho uses rock 'n' roll to teach untalented kids to appreciate music.The twist in this version is that the teacher wants to be a composerand only takes a teaching position so that he can have the time andmoney to be able to compose, but he finds teaching to be more than afull-time job leaving little time for outside interests.  When hefinally does finish his American Symphony, he demonstrates, in myopinion, that teaching was the right profession for him anyway.       As the movie starts, Mr. Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) isbeginning his first year at John F. Kennedy High School by teachingmusic to the class of 65.  As someone who was a member of another highschool class of 65 (Garland, Texas), I can attest to the carefulaccuracy of the sets (David Nickolas) and the costumes (Aggie GuerrardRodgers).  Mr. Holland finds he has a group of lethargic and untalentedstudents, and their attempt at music results in a horrible cacophony.He hates his job, and at first he is terrible at it.  He uses littlewitticisms like ""There's more to music than notes on a page"" and""Playing music is supposed to be fun"" in attempts to awaken and inspirehis stoic students.  Nothing works until he starts playing rock 'n'roll to them and after that he becomes a big hit with the kids althoughtheir playing only goes from pathetic to passable.       In a great performance W. H. Macy is Vice Principal Gene Wolters.He is the tuff principal with a flat top that you remember from highschool.  You know, the one that measures girls skirts and sends themhome if their skirts are not regulation length.  Wolters does notapprove of Mr. Holland's unorthodox methods and tells him sternly that""Rock 'n' roll by its very nature leads to a breakdown in discipline.""Olympia Dukakis plays Principal Jacobs who supports Mr. Holland.  JayThomas is excellent as football Coach Bill Meister and Mr. Holland'sbest friend at school.  In a story with a plethora of cliches, thecoach gets his students to dance at the school play and thus boostticket sales.       The corny but fun script (Patrick Duncan) is peppered with greatlittle one liners.  The coach wants his wrestling star Louis Russ(Terrence Howard) to play an instrument in the band so he can get hisgrade point average high enough not to get kicked off the wrestlingteam, but Mr. Holland has trouble finding an instrument for him.  Whenoffered a tuba, Russ complains that, ""Tubas are for fat guys withpimples.""       The secondary theme in the show surrounds Mr. Holland's family.His wife Iris (Glenne Headly) has a son whom Mr. Holland names Colafter his idol John William Coltrane, the innovative American jazzsaxophonist and composer.  Mr. Holland loves music and wants his son tobe just like him.  Well, his son turns out deaf.  In a scene that willtear your heart out, Col throws a temper tantrum at age 6 because hecan not communicate with his parents enough even to tell them his mostbasic needs.  Mr. Holland is too busy at school to pay much attentionto his son or to learn minimal competency in sign language so he cantalk to his son.  Iris laments to him, ""Why is everyone else's childmore important than yours?""       Hands down, the best actor or actress in the whole movie is JeanLouisa Kelly who has a small but important role as Rowena Morgan.Rowena is a surprise star for the school musical.  When she sings oracts she casts a spell on people in the movie and in the audience.  Agreat voice and a mesmerizing smile.  I'd love to see her up for anaward for supporting actress, but I am sure she will be ignored infavor of Olympia Dukakis's more traditional performance.       I find Richard Dreyfuss an uneven and hence frustrating actor towatch, but in MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS, director Stephen Herek has him inperfect control.  Dreyfuss never overacts as he has been known to do,see for example, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT or LET IT RIDE.  Here Dreyfussis a master at manipulating the audience's emotion for maximum effect,but yet he gives a restrained rendition of the character.       MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is sappy and predictable.  It uses a lot ofstock film footage of the Vietnam war to remind the audience of thetragedy of that era.  Since I had friends die in Vietnam, I found theburial scene extremely moving.  The editor (Trudy Ship) is quite adeptat cutting at just at the right moment between tragedy and joy andbetween the movie and the old film clips of that period.       This is definitely a message movie.  Principle Wolters sums it upwith, ""If I'm forced to choose between music and reading, writing, andlong division, I choose long division every time.""  This is contrastedwith Mr. Holland's view that ""the day they cut the football budget inthis state, that will be the end of Western Civilization as we knowit!""       The ending is a full blown tearjerker.  Save a spare batch ofhankies for the conclusion.  At least it ends on a complete high note(pun intended).       MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS runs an incredibly long 2:22.  I think this iscompletely unnecessary since this is not GANDHI, but I must admit itdid keep my attention, and I never looked at my watch.  The movie isincorrectly rated PG.  This is a G movie where I think they said acouple of cuss words just to keep it from getting a G rating.  There isno sex, nudity, or violence.  There is a key scene where one characterkisses another on the cheek.  I recommend the movie to you and givethis sweet, upbeat tearjerker ***. ",Mr. Holland's Opus,PG,1996,2.5
642," Richard Gere is a really great actor, but sometimes hispresence of the screen can be really annoying. It usuallyhappens because of his tendency to torpedo many promisingroles with his overacting, often inappropriate for theoccasion. However, while many conventional roles are simplytoo conventional for Gere, there are roles that look like aperfect fit for his usual screen personality. Many of thoseroles deal with some forms of mental illness or deficiency -fertile ground for Academy Awards, judging by the last fewdecades.  Of all mental illnesses, manic-depressive psychosis (or""bipolar disorder"", as refered in modern American medicalliterature) is probably the most suitable for actors whowant to push their limits. While the intellectual abilitiesof the patients are untouched, that illness is characterisedwith sometimes sudden, sometimes gradual mood swings thatvary between manic euphoria and almost catatonic depression.In this film Richard Gere plays Mr. Jones, one of the peoplewho are suffering from that illness. But when we areintroduced to Mr. Jones, we see that he doesn't suffer atall - we are exposed to his manic side, his ""highs"", and helook like someone who enjoys life more than most of us.Problem is that his euphoric outbursts often lead him totrouble, like when he tries to fly off the constructionsite, or conduct philharmonic concerto by himself. As anaftermath of those incidents, he is always brought back topsychiatric ward, and medical staff tries to control hiscondition with various drugs. Doctor Libbie Bowen (LenaOlin) is trying to treat him, but soon she finds that shehas more than professional interests in her patient.  British director Mike Figgis has already made reputation byoften dark and depressing dramas and thrillers like STORMYMONDAY or INTERNAL AFFAIRS. In MR. JONES, his tendencytowards depressive subject was watered down due to thescript by Eric Roth and Michael Christopher. Two writersdecided to make this film light, despite its serious andpotentially very depressive subject. As a result, theaudience finds very little about the main character - atleast when he has his ""bad"" days. We also find very littleabout the nature of the illness itself, and the dilemmaspsychiatrists must make when they deal with patients.Finally, in order to make this film as formulaic aspossible, we are given unecessary and quite disappointingromantic subplot.  But, it actually doesn't matter much in the end. RichardGere in this role behaves like a fish in the water andliterally chewes the screen with his acting. Of course, hispersonality overshadowed anyone else, including his partnerLena Olin, but we are still able to notice more than goodsupporting roles, most notable of them being one played byDelroy Lindo. In the end, film ends predictably, but formost of its 114 minutes, audience isn't bored, mostly thanksto Figgis' capable directing and good production values.Hardly a masterpiece, and nothing more than a solid piece offormulaic Hollywood entertainment, MR. JONES is still thefilm to be recommended, and not just to Richard Gere fans orthose who like melodramas. ",Mr. Jones,R,1993,2.5
643,"      Some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning, alive-action version of MR. MAGOO being a prime example.  The cartoonfigure Mr. Magoo, the bumbling blind man, can be quite funny, but onlyin small doses and only within the confines of animated images.       If you think NAKED GUN star Leslie Nielsen is a dubious choice toplay the role of the short guy who runs into walls, you are right, butthere is an even more astonishing selection.  For a director theytapped Hong Kong's Stanley Tong, whose resume consists mainly of ahandful of movies featuring martial arts expert Jackie Chan.       The story, such that there is one, is about a large, stolen ruby,which looks a Woolworth reject.  Mr. Magoo gets it and, of course, doesnot realize he has it.  Mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guyschase each other with Mr. Magoo frequently oblivious to the fact thatanyone is being chased.       Like HOME ALONE 3 but without any class, MR. MAGOO can only bedescribed as painfully bad.  Fifteen minutes of it feels like aneternity.  The movie's humor is pathetically lame, and the pacing isway off.       When one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watchingwhat claims to be a motion picture, one looks for some solace.  MR.MAGOO provides only three such moments.       The movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of thecharacter, who exudes his usual charm.  The only other saving grave inthe movie itself is Angus, the sweet little bulldog.  Angusdemonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any ofthe humans in the picture.  Finally, the ending credits containouttakes of the movie, which have some of the genuineness andspontaneity that the movie badly lacked.       Rather than attempt to adapt Mr. Magoo to a non-cartoon movie,Nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a humanversion of the cartoon.  He has trouble sustaining the squinting eyesand the affected voice, and even when he does it comes off as awkwardlyunfunny. ",Mr. Magoo,PG,1997,0.5
644," I've never really enjoyed period pieces because, most of the time, I don't think they are done very well. Usually, they seem to lack the urgency that they desperately need so that they become interesting. In ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" unfortnately, there is no such luck.  At the start of ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which is set over a period of one day in 1923, the title character (Vanessa Redgrave), an aging, recently divorced woman living in England, is preparing for a party that she will be holding that night. Throughout the day, she reflects back to the life she once knew when she was a young woman (portrayed by Natascha McElhone), and had the chance to marry a spontaneous, loving man (Rupert Graves), but chose instead to play it safe with an uncaring beau.   I rented ""Mrs. Dalloway"" basically because I thought it might be interesting, since it is set during a 24-hour period, but what I didn't count on was for it to be constantly distracting. The film switches countless times from 1923 to when she was younger, to the point that it started to feel muddled and painfully episodic. By having the story cut away so often to other things (and a few subplots I haven't mentioned), I could never get caught up in Mrs. Dalloway's ultimate search for happiness. And the way that another story involving a shell-shocked WWI soldier is interwined with the main one felt convoluted and obvious.  The performances in ""Mrs. Dalloway"" are not to be faulted. Redgrave is believable as Mrs. Dalloway, and she looks startlingly like McElhone, who plays her in the flashbacks. Another performance I admired, but who was underused, was Katie Carr, as Redgrave's young daughter.  Since the structuring of the story was needlessly drawn out and unnecessary, I didn't grow to care about any of the characters, and at the end, when ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" attempts to be moving, it left me cold.  ",Mrs. Dalloway,PG-13,1998,1.5
645,"      I was one of the few human beings had not seen MRS. DOUBTFIRE at the movies.  Why had I avoided it before?  I thought, incorrectly, that it was a slapstick comedy made up mainly of sight gags.  I shouldstop paying attention to the advertising.       I found MRS. DOUBTFIRE to be a gem of a movie that worked almostperfectly on two levels for me.  First, it was a comedy in the spiritof, albeit not quite as good as, TOOTSIE.  I laughed so hard severaltimes that I had trouble stopping.  Second, it is a serious and sadmovie about the pains of a divorce - especially about the effects onthe Dad and on the kids.       The mom (Sally Field) was a workaholic who even after the divorcewould drop the kids off late and pick them up early because she was sobusy you see and had very little time and had all of these things to dofor work and ...  The Dad (Robin Williams) was the positive force inthe family.  He was very funny with the kids, and they loved him unlikehis wife who decided she could not stand him.  His wild and crazyantics, like the birthday party with the animals, were too much for thewife.  She dumped him.  At the same time he lost his job over anintegrity dispute with his employer.       Unemployed and needing a job he takes a position as the threechildren's nanny but with disguised as Mrs. Doubtfire.  Unemployed andwithout a suitable home for them, he is degraded by the courts to be avisitor (Saturdays only) in his children's lives.       I found even his costume to have wonderful symbolism in it too.He was dressed as a fat and unattractive person whereas inside he was amuch thinner and good looking person.  He wanted in the worst way tobreak out of this and be himself again.       I hated the way they wrapped up the ending, but depending on yoursituation and your beliefs, you may love it.       This movie is a tour de force for Robin Williams - probably one ofhis greatest roles ever.  I have had mixed but mainly positive feelingsabout him in the past.  I thought he was brilliant in some of hismovies (AWAKENINGS, DEAD POET SOCIETY, GOOD MORNING VIETNAM, and MOSCOWON THE HUDSON) and unwatchably bad in others (especially THE FISHERKING).  You can feel his pain in this movie, and his humor isincredible.  The rest of the actors and actresses were okay, but in adifferent league.       MRS. DOUBTFIRE runs 2:07, but I thought it was carefully edited(Raja Gosnell) and directed (Chris Columbus) and I would not want tocut out or change very much of it at all.  It is rated PG-13 for theseriousness of its material.  I STRONGLY recommend this movie toeveryone and rate it *** 1/2. ",Mrs. Doubtfire,PG-13,1993,2.5
646,"      MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE is the true story of DorothyParker (usually called Mrs. Parker) and her literary friends that metevery day for conversation at the Algonquin Hotel in New York.  Theyalways ate at a round table which was saved every day for the dozen orso of New York's literary elite.  There were writers, painters, actors,comedians, and most of all, literary critics.  They wrote for manydifferent magazines from Vanity Fair to the one they started, The NewYorker.       The movie happens mainly in the 20s with the focal point being thedaily gathering at the Algonquin for lunch.  Dorothy had a room therewhere she was usually delinquent with the bill but where she was notkicked out for obvious reasons.  She made her money writing what shereferred to as little ""do-das"" for various magazines.  She was acritic, an author and a poet, but most of all she was famous for herround table conversations.       The glue that keeps the film together is black and white footageof Dorothy in the 1940s and 1950s.  She talks briefly about her life orshe recites a short poem of hers and then we are back in color in the1920s.       The artists at the round table were sort of the second string ofthat era.  You will recognize the names, but they were not the best.Although the image one has of them is discussing Kant and Nietzsche andof the meaning of life, in fact, the conversations were only of theshallow variety.  The banter around the table was nothing more thansarcastic one liners.  They had an obsession with being with each otherand yet all they could do was issue trite put downs of one another.       Dorothy and all of the artist were heavy and constant drinkersfrom sun up to sun down.  They agreed that as one of the writers putit, ""the only way to cure a hangover is never stop drinking."" Dorothy'sfirst husband was also a morphine drug addict.  She lived her lifeextremely depressed and tried suicide on many occasions.  One doctorasked them why the artist group felt the need to be with each other allof the time and why were they afraid of enjoying life and being happy.       What makes this show worth seeing is the performance by JenniferJason Leigh (remember her as the bad girl in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE?).Her performance deserves an academy award nomination.  You can feelMrs.  Parker's depression and the utter emptiness of her life.  Shejumps from one man's bed to another without managing to really everenjoy herself.  Finally, I especially liked the accent, low and raspy,that Leigh used.       Most of the show gets a little tedious and long after a while.  Doyou like hanging around with a bunch of drunks, albeit some brilliantones?  Do you like sharing your evenings with people who are scared ofbeing anything other than shallow?  Want to fall for a beautiful loverwho is so depressed she wants to slash her wrists frequently?  Accuratethis all may be, but it was a bit much for me after a while.       MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE runs too long at 2:05.  It iscorrectly rated R for some low key, natural nudity, massivedrunkenness, and one drug usage scene.  Older and mature teenagerscould probably see it if they like.  Solely on the basis of JenniferJason Leigh's performance, I do recommend this movie to you, and I giveit ** 1/2. ",Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,R,1994,2.5
647,"      MRS. WINTERBOURE is another one of those mistaken identity films.It is reported to be a remake of NO MAN OF HER OWN (1949) and J'AIEPOUSE UNE OMBRE (1982), but since I have never seen either of these Ican not verify this.  At any rate, MRS. WINTERBOURE feels like a movieyou have seen a hundred times before, and predictability is its middlename.       The set up for the movie is that Connie Doyle (Ricki Lake) getspregnant by a cliche of an uncaring louse of a boyfriend, Steve (LorenDean).  Steve gets his buddies to claim that they slept with her so hecan say that he can not be sure whose kid it is.  He then kicks her outinto the cold.       One hellish night on a train she meets another equally pregnantwoman, Patricia Winterbourne (Susan Haskell) and her husband Hugh(Brendan Fraser).  After a train wreck, Connie is mistakenly identifiedas Patricia Winterbourne since the real Patricia and her husband werekilled.  This bit of confusion whisks Connie into a life of luxury asthe daughter-in-law of super-rich Grace Winterbourne (ShirleyMacLaine).  Living with Grace is Hugh's twin Bill (Brendan Fraser).The family turns out to be dysfunctional as are almost all richfamilies in the movies.       Most of the picture is about whether Connie will be found out.What is your guess?  Although Bill claims to hate Connie, how do youthink their relationship will turn out?  Since Steve's son is nowsuper-rich, what do you think Steve will do?  See what I mean, youcould write the script yourself.  The producers did not need to hireLisa-Marie Radano and Phoef Sutton to craft a script from CornellWoolrich's book (""I Married a Dead Man"").       Actually, the biggest problem with the show is not itspredictability nor its believability, both of which are substantial,but the lack of energy.  The directing by Richard Benjamin is aimless.The actors float through the movie as if they are all on Sominex.  Mostof the film is a failed attempt at comedy, but the lines the actors aregiven are so ineffectual that it is hopeless.  Frequently the filmrelies on sight gags that make little sense and are not particularlyfunny.  Connie, for example, sees the reflection of an upside downcrucifix in the baptismal water and somehow this causes her to faint.       After trying comedy in the first part, the story switches to amore serious tone toward the end.  The characters begin to show theirwarm hearts, but the characters are so lifeless that this part works nobetter than the first.  I tried to like this show, but there is solittle there that it was not possible for me.  I will give it this, itis pretty inoffensive.  For people wanting to watch something to fallasleep by, it probably fills the bill.       MRS. WINTERBOURNE runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for a little badlanguage.  It would probably fine for kids say 10 and up.  I do notrecommend it, and I give it * 1/2. ",Mrs. Winterbourne,PG-13,1996,1
648,"     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is another Shakespearean film from thatShakespearean master Kenneth Branagh.  There is no one today who can doShakespeare like Branagh, see, for example, his HENRY V, which wasnumber one on my list the year it was released.  In MUCH ADO ABOUTNOTHING, he wrote the screen adaptation as well as did the direction.       I will assume that most of you know the plot In MUCH ADO ABOUTNOTHING from school so I will not repeat in detail here.  Suffice it tosay that there are a pair of lovers - one younger, Hero (KateBeckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), and one older, Beatrice(Emma Thompson) and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh).  The younger pair knowthey are in love and plan to get married in a week, but the nefariousDon Pedro (Denzel Washington) tries to keep the wedding from happening.The older lovers fight like an old married couple and claim they hateeach other.  Typical Shakespeare, there are a lot of other charactersincluding Keanu Reeves as Don John, Richard Briers as Leonato, BrianBlessed as Antonio, and last, and certainly least, Michael Keaton asDogberry.       The movie is uneven, but the range is from good to outstanding.Whenever Kenneth Branagh and his lover Emma Thompson have any scenestogether, it is as close to perfection as it gets.  They have so muchenergy, it makes you feel alive and glad to be on any planet theyinhabit.  They are the older lovers in the show, but by far and awaythe most interesting.       The younger lovers' acting abilities are okay at best.  RobertSean Leonard's acting is quite unsure in the early scenes, but he warmsup a bit to the part as the movie builds steam.  On the whole, I foundtheir romance a disappointment.  I still remember ROMEO AND JULIET(1969) so I know how great it can be.       Although Denzel Washington is in the film, his heart and passionseem to be somewhere else.  This is the first show I have seen him inwhere he did not steal the show.  He is fine in his role, but nothingspecial.  The only serious problem in the casting is Michael Keaton.As an actor, when he is good, he is very very good (see for exampleCLEAN AND SOBER), and when he is bad (don't see ONE GOOD COP), he isawful.  I have not seen such overacting in a long time as his acting inMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.  The only saving grace is that he only has asmall part.       The technical aspects of the movie are outstanding.  Thecinematography by Roger Lanser and the sets by Tim Harvey are lush andgorgeous.  The music by Patrick Doyle is breathtaking.       If you feel in the mood for a movie not costing somethingapproaching the national debt to produce, if you actually enjoy humansin your movies (no, I am not dinophobic, but there is more to life thanJURASSIC PARK), if you especially like humans who can talk and havesomething to say at the same time, if you like screens smaller thanCandlestick park, then go to your local art house and see MUCH ADOABOUT NOTHING.       MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING runs 1:51.  It is correctly rated PG-13 andwould be fine for any kid old enough to appreciate the Bard.  Irecommend the show to you and give it ***.  I look forward with greatanticipation to Branagh's next Shakespeare piece, and the one afterthat, and the one that ... ",Much Ado About Nothing,PG-13,1993,3
649,"David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a cross between a slow-motion episode of""The X Files"" and a super long version of ""Twin Peaks.""  A baffling butalways intriguing failure, the movie gets more confusing, not less, as thestory unfolds.  Lynch won the director's prize at this year's Cannes FilmFestival for the film.  It would have been more appropriate if he had agotten a dual award -- a first for directing and a booby prize for writing.Lynch can make the simple act of walking down a small staircase ominous, buthis script is full of bewildering and unrealistic characters for whom wecare nothing. Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is a ""golly-gee"" kind of would-be starlet who hasjust arrived in Los Angeles in order to make her fortune in the movies.Upon arrival, this innocent blonde goes to her new apartment, where shefinds a mysterious, dark-haired beauty who may or may not be named Rita(Laura Harring).  Rita, who was recently in a car accident, isn't sure ofmuch about herself, including her own name. A typically bizarre event at the apartment has a mysterious woman dressed ina heavy black robe knocking on Betty's door.  Looking like someone from agothic novel, this stranger in the shadows warns Betty, ""Someone is introuble.  Something bad is happening.""  When she closes the door, Betty'sonly response is, ""Wow!""  Yours will probably be an equally simplistic,""Huh?""  You'll be thinking that a lot during this movie, which needs apictorial scorecard to keep track of all of the quirky characters who makebrief appearances.  One known only as ""The Cowboy,"" who acts like he'sattempting Jedi mind tricks, is perhaps the most bizarre character. Meanwhile, across town director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is casting hisnew movie.  A couple of strange Mafia types insist that, for the leadingrole, Adam must choose their actress, Cammie Rhodes (Melissa George) -- norelation.  One of these perplexing bad guys asks for an espresso and anapkin, which he uses to slowly spit out the drink when it is not up to hisdemanding standards. Almost every scene is full of foreboding, although the source of the dangeris never quite clear.  Frequently Lynch appears to have his camera dollyfloating on a gently undulating sea in order to enhance the audience'squeasiness.   Before the ending credits roll, there is a murder, some mistaken identities,a puzzling small box, a couple of Lesbian love scenes and one confusingincident after another.  ""I'm going to trust you to sort this thing out,""Coco (Ann Miller) tells Betty at one point.  Good luck.   MULHOLLAND DRIVE runs way too long at 2:26.

Lieutenant Hooper replies, ""This isn't AmericaJack.  This is LA.""  They then push him down the mountain.  From thefirst snappy dialog by Peter Dexter, you know this movie is in majortrouble.  The cliched music (Dave Gruso) of loud, thumping, staccatopiano notes is a another clue that it is not going to be a pleasanttime at the picture show.       The four cops ride around in a great looking black BuickRoadmaster convertible from the mid-50s.  They all wear large hats inthe car and in most other scenes as well.  Since these four musketeersare all extremely large men with broad shoulders, they fill the caralmost to overflowing.  Every scene with them driving around in the caris a lot of fun albeit totally ridiculous; they look like a bunch ofcartoon characters.  The movie can be humorous at times and the smalltalk they make among themselves about how they always sit in the samespots is cute.       Oh, I forgot to warn you.  You are required to check your brain atthe theater entrance.  There are so many parts of the story that eithermake no sense, are ridiculous, or are telegraphed in advance like neonsigns that you will go crazy if you try to think about what you areseeing.  The reality gaps range from the small to the large.  Forexample, have you ever tried talking in a normal voice from the frontseat to the back without turning around.  Not too hard, you say.  Well,how about in a convertible driving across a desert going 60 miles anhour?  Does wind noise allow you to hear anything?  Ever worn a hat inthe back seat of a convertible for long distances at high speeds?  Didthe hat blow a little bit?  In this movie, we have no wind, no noise,and all hats stay nicely in place without any movement whatsoever.I'll get to the big errors later.       Since it is the 50s, you probably have already guessed that ourgovernment is up to some sinister plot.  It seems that a girl played byJennifer Connelley has turned up dead.  She has a link to General Timms(John Malkovich) who is the head of the Atomic Energy Commission.  Thegeneral is the inventor of the atomic bomb and lives in a mansion closeto the testing site in a desert near LA.  General Timms propounds suchsentiments as ""A hundred die so that a thousand may live.""       The girl also has a link to Max.  In a truly awful performance,Melanie Griffith plays Max's wife Catherine who gets drawn into thelink as well.  Griffith looks terrible in the movie.  So sad, she couldonce light up the screen, see, for example, WORKING GIRL.       Now on to some of the larger preposterous parts of the film.  Letssay it is the 50s and every one is scared to death of the A-bomb.  Doyou want to break in and drive around on the proving ground where theytest the bomb?  If so, do you want to pick up and put in your pocketwhat clearly appears to be radioactive material?  Do you believe thatcops in full view of others will kill bad guys with the bad guys'drugs?  Do you believe that the cops would go after the FBI and beatthem up over a turf battle?  Do you think police will slug people intheir eyes when they are wearing eyeglasses.  I could go on and on withthese.       For the worse acting award in this movie, Griffith actually losesalthough she does come in third place.  In first place is AndrewMcCarthy playing a scumball by the name of Jimmy Fields.  His actinggrates on your nerves it is so pathetic.  In a close second is TreatWilliams as Colonel Fitzpatrick and the second in command to thegeneral.  He is totally unbelievable.  His last scene in the picturecomes way too late.       Nolte vacillates between a withdrawn and sad look and an angry andviolent one.  He is an uneven actor that needs a good director with astrong hand to keep him under control.  The weakest part of the team ofthis movie was the director, Lee Tamahori.  He had a talented cast thatwas horribly misdirected.       The are some good parts to the movie other than the funny carscenes.  When our heroes stare down into a gigantic hole carved out byan atomic bomb, it is funny.  Bruce Dern gives an off-the-wallperformance as a police commissioner who should have retired yearsearlier.  He hates these ""little ivy league types"" from the FBI whocome in and try to tell him what to do in his town.       There is other good acting as well.  Chazz Palminteri is given thebest part and does a good job with it.  John Malkovich is given aterrible role that is poorly written and yet manages to make itinteresting to watch nevertheless.  That he could do anything with itis a minor miracle.       MULHOLLAND FALLS runs 1:40, and it drags a lot.  It is rated R formajor amounts of totally gratuitous blood and gore - from horriblydisfigured bodies with radiation poisoning to faces and guts blownabout.  There is also some sex and nudity.  I would only let quitemature teenagers see the film, but I do not recommend this show toanyone.  For some of the laughs and for a few good performances in anotherwise awful movie, I give the film a single *. ",Mulholland Falls,R,1996,1
651,"      Are the triple demands of work, family, and home too much for youlately?  Ever find time for yourself?  How often do you get to practiceyour golf game?       Director Harold Ramis (GROUNDHOG DAY) has just the tonic for you -more time through the miracles of cloning.  One of you not enough?  Howabout three more to help you out?  Be warned, however, there are a fewpitfalls to this wonder cure to your chronic exhaustion.       In MULTIPLICITY, construction supervisor Doug Kinney (MichaelKeaton) is suffering from massive overload just like you.  He lamentsthat, ""my whole life's an emergency.""  Ted (John De Lancie) and hiscoworkers are workaholics whose mottoes include, ""if you don't come inon Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.""       No problem, says Dr. Leeds (Harris Yulin), all Doug needs is aclone.  In fact the good doctor already has one which allows him totravel while the clone works.  Although Doug is worried that his clonewill be half human and half insect as in THE FLY, number two is aperfect duplicate with the same memory as Doug.  As it turns out, twois tougher and harder working than Doug which is fine with number one.       His wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell from FOUR WEDDINGS AND AFUNERAL), says she wants to go back to work, but Doug will have to helpout.  She doesn't know about the cloning.  Doug is overwhelmed by thedomestic chores so gets a number three to take care of the kids and thehouse.  Since number three turns out to have more of Doug's gentler anddomestic side, this looks pretty ideal.  As number one puts it, ""I'vebeen working since I was twelve; it's break time.""       Eventually, number two gets tired too and clones himself to getnumber four.  Four is, well, not exactly perfect.  As three puts it,""we made a copy of number two.  You know, sometimes the copy isn't assharp as the original.""  That's an understatement.       With this great setup and with Michael Keaton's comedic skills, itwould be hard to make a bad movie.  MULTIPLICITY, while far from agreat comedy, did provide this critic with a lot of laughs and made fora thoroughly enjoyable time at the movies.  Yes, there are severalperiods devoid of humor, and some of the physical comedy is a bit toooutlandish.  Nevertheless, this is one funny movie.       The script by the committee of Lowell Ganz, Mary Hale, BabalooMandel, Chris Miller, and Harold Ramis comes up more with situationsthat are funny than with witty dialog.  The housing development Doug isworking on, for example, is proclaimed in the billboard to be Vista deNada.       There are some gems in the script.  Number one keeps reminding theothers of rule number one, ""nobody has sex with my wife but me.""  In asmall line I like, Doug's young son's football coach tells Doug howclueless his players are, ""I've got kids who couldn't identify theirparents in a line-up.""       The acting by Michael Keaton is excellent albeit not as good assome of his performances.  In a secondary role, Andie MacDowell holdsher own.  Her acting gets better and better as the movie unfolds.  Iadmire the talent of both these performers and since they have almostall of the lines in the show, I got to see a lot of them.  Leftunanswered by the credits is who played numbers two, three, and four.       MULTIPLICITY runs a fast 1:55.  It is rated PG-13.  There is nosex, nudity, violence, and the language is pretty mild.  I suspect thereason it got PG-13 rather than PG is because there are a few sexualsituations.  The film would be fine for most kids ten and over.  Irecommend the show and give it ** 1/2. ",Multiplicity,PG-13,1996,2.5
652,"  What does it take to be a good psychologist?  How can you getpeople to confide their fantasies, dreams, and frustrations in orderto alleviate the pain of the human condition? Writer/director LawrenceKasdan believes that listening, really listening is the most importantskill - and that's the premise for his intelligent, amusing newcomedy. Loren Dean (""Billy Bathgate"") stars as Dr. Mumford, a youngpsychologist who opens a practice in a small, picturesque town,coincidentally named Mumford, and discovers his unorthodox form oftherapy has amazing, unexpected results with an odd assortment ofquirky locals. There's a young divorcee suffering from Chronic FatigueSyndrome (Hope Davis), a pulp-fiction obsessed pharmacist (PruittTaylor Vince), a frustrated housewife (Mary McDonnell) who's becomeaddicted to mail-order shopping, her workaholic husband (Ted Danson),a fashion-preoccupied teen (Zooey Deschanel), Mumford's outspokenlandlady (Alfre Woodard) who runs the local cafe, and a lonelybillionaire (Jason Lee), the monarch of modems, who zips around on askateboard. While they respond to his empathy and frankness, no onerealizes that mysterious, unconventional Dr. Mumford has the biggestsecret of all - except maybe a suspicious attorney (Martin Short) andthe two other therapists in town (David Paymer, Jane Adams).  Like""The Big Chill,"" ""The Accidental Tourist,"" and ""Grand Canyon,"" this isan excellent ensemble effort, which is a credit to Kasden's talent forcasting. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Mumford"" is afantastical, intriguing 8, proving that love comes in many disguises. ",Mumford,R,1999,2.5
653,"THE MUMMY RETURNS, again directed by Stephen Sommers, is a film with acomplex.  It's a relentless movie that seems in constant fear that if itever slows down for a minute the entire audience will walk out.  Rarelypausing to smell the flowers or to provide the requisite motivation andbackground, the confusing story scurries around like the thousands ofscorpions that take the place of Indiana Jones's snakes. And speaking of Indiana Jones, the movie wants badly to morph into anIndiana Jones-type franchise, a movie it mimics constantly.  It also borrowsliberally from the fight sequences of STAR WARS EPISODE I - THE PHANTOMMENACE and the creatures from GREMLINS.  Gone is the campy charm from theprevious MUMMY.  Instead, we have lots of nifty computer generated effectsand warriors and non-stop action.  This is the perfect movie for 12-year-oldboys, since most have grown too sophisticated for Saturday morning cartoonmayhem. The stars from last time are back.  Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evie (RachelWeisz) are now married and have an 8-year-old son, Alex (Freddie Boath).Alex is a chip off the old block, curious and adventuresome like hisparents.  This time Weisz gets many opportunities to flex her muscles, andshe turns out to be a surprisingly credible action star. Arnold Vosloo again plays the mummy Im-Ho-Tep.  Not content with a singlevillain, the sequel adds WWF's The Rock playing The Scorpion King,Im-Ho-Tep's competition.  Rick will have to take them both out or the worldwill end.  What seems to never end is the movie itself.  I lost count of thenumber of ""endings"" that were merely preludes to other fight sequences. As a display of computer generated images, the movie does dazzle andimpress.  It can also be imaginative with a Jules Verne inspiredboat/dirigible being the most memorable.   ""You know,"" Rick confesses, ""a couple of years ago, this would have seemedreally strange to me.""  That's the problem with the sequel.  We've seen itall before.  The only idea that the director had for the sequel was ""more.""More special effects and lots more fighting.  Its target audience willundoubtedly love it. THE MUMMY RETURNS runs a long 2:01.  It is rated PG-13 for adventure actionand violence and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.  Youngerones could be severely frightened.","Mummy Returns, The",PG-13,2001,2
654,"Remember that kid back in high school, the one who wascaptain of the football team, so sexually assured that thecheerleaders would flock around him, and what's more was ableto score in sciences and humanities in much the way he did withthe girls?  What did you think of him?  You admired him? Hardly.  You hated him, didn't you!  You envied his natural goodlooks and sought out the class dork so you could make fun ofhim and feel superior to someone.  Barbet Schroeder'sthoughtful and suspenseful ""Murder by Numbers"" is particularlyintriguing because the two high school seniors he focuseson one a sexually assured charmer, the other a dorkyphilosopher-- seem to get along just great, a complete reversalof the stereotypical grouping of 17-year-olds by separatecategories like jocks, nerds, and as with the tragic event ofColumbine, Colorado High School, the outsiders who wereknown there as the Mafia.  The two young men are, in turn, the""genius"" who is sought after by at least one girl because of hispotential to help her in physics, Justin (Michael Pitt, ""Bully""), andthe all-around, all-American Richard (Ryan Gosling) with whomJustin has a subtly homoerotic bond.     As the camera shifts from the two boys to two detectivesdetermined to solve a murder case, Cassie (Sandra Bullock)and her rookie partner Sam (Ben Chaplin), Schroeder peelsmore than one onion during the two hours he enjoys with his crew.  We become even more interested in the psychologicalproblems of Cassie than in the minds of either of the two boys. Schroeder, adapting Tony Gayton's screenplay with aHitchcockian style (we know the identity of the killers in the verybeginning of the movie), keeps us wondering what there is inCassie's background that makes her hate this kid Richard somuch, makes her so fiercely determined to pin a murder rap onhim that she risks her mental health and pushes the envelopewith her boss in the local California homicide division.  Cassie isas sexually aggressive as the kid she's after, seducing Sam, hernew partner, and then kicking him out of her houseboatresidence when he's more than eager to have breakfast withher.  We wonder why, when Cassie investigates a scene of abrutal crime, she reverts in her memory to a traumatic situationin her own life that must be the source of her pain.     As Cassie questions young Richard who deliberately does notseek a lawyer because he and his intellectual pal Justin want toprove that they are smarter than the cops a counter-transference takes place.  Richard is being psychologicallybroken down by the detective but more interestingly Cassie isherself undergoing stress because of an incident in her life thatcomes to her conscious mind painfully during the interrogations.     Ben Chaplin does well as yin to Sandra Bullock's yang, apassive guy (as he was in ""The Birthday Girl"") while Bullock,who is co-executive producer of the film, chucks her comicdemeanor to become a troubled, no-nonsense, sexuallyconflicted powerhouse.       The melodramatic ending, which some in the audience willprobably cheer as a break from the tense scenes of non-violent psychological tension were for me the onlydisappointment in a classy thriller that does justice to theIranian-born Schroeder, the son of a German geologist raised inIran and Argentina before settling down in France.  There's nosurprise that he once wrote for the classy Cahiers du Cinema,given his painstaking laying of the groundwork in this murderstory, and garnered an Oscar nomination for one his mostchilling works, ""Reversal of Fortune."" ",Murder By Numbers,R,2002,2.5
655,"      MURDER AT 1600 fits right in with its ancestors - this year's THESHADOW CONSPIRACY and ABSOLUTE POWER.  We have yet another massiveconspiracy plot with the White House at the center of the duplicity.Like its forefathers, it stretches credibility way past the breakingpoint.       All of this having been said, director Dwight Little's MURDER AT1600 still turns out to be an entertaining thriller.  Yes, the story ispreposterous and the acting by the supporting cast borders on parody,but the performances by Wesley Snipes and Diane Lane enliven what wouldotherwise be a pedestrian movie.  They appear to believe their materialand manage to transfer their acceptance to the audience.  Whereas Inormally get obsessed with the problems of such a Swiss cheesethriller, this time I found myself swept up into the two heroes'predicaments.  They believed, so I believed, and I rooted for themright down to the last chase scene.       ""Yeah, yeah, I got a coat and tie,"" says the D. C. HomicideDetective Harlan Regis (Snipes) as he answers his boss's call.  ""1600what?""  That's right, there has been a murder at 1600 PennsylvaniaAvenue, and for some reason the Secret Service wants a local cop toinvestigate.       In the opening scene, Regis establishes his macho prowess, butwill this new assignment be more than he can handle?  When he arrivesat the White House he finds a woman who has been murdered soon afterhaving has sex with someone, but clues are hard to find, and the SecretService is hiding what it knows under the covers of secrecy.  How manypeople were in the White House at the time of the murder? -- 31, butthe official list only has names 30 of them.  Regis cannot get the nameof the other because of reasons of national security.       When Regis goes to the home of the dead woman, the Secret Servicehas already stripped it of all the evidence, which it will not showhim.  Moreover, they managed to arrive at her house only fifteenminutes after she was killed.  This does not add up.  Except for theFirst Family, who were at Camp David, Regis considers everyone elsepossible suspects.       All of this happens quickly at the first of the movie.  From therethe film, filled with dramatic music (Christopher Young) down in thelow registers, moves from surprise to surprise with several obligatorychase scenes to keep the energy going.  The sound effects include therequisite number of thunderstorms lest you forget to be frightened.       Beside the impossibility of the script by Wayne Beach and DavidHodgin, the dialog borders on the trite, especially in one superciliousspeech at the end.  Still, the story line twists one way and thenanother and always keeps your attention.  Every time you think you havethe mystery figured out, you don't.       Although Snipes has star billing, Diane Lane's performance isequal to his.  She plays tough Secret Service agent Nina Chance.  Shemanages to be beautiful without any sexual connotations.  She is acareer agent trapped between her conscience and her dedication to herposition.  Both Snipes and Lane play intelligent people withinteresting other lives.  Regis constructs Civil War battlefieldmodels, and Chance was a gold metal sharpshooter at the Olympics.       Daniel Benzali wins the award for the worst performance in thefilm.  With a constant scowl and a shaved head, he plays the evermenacing Nick Spikings, head of White House security.  He grunts mostof his lines.       Ronny Cox plays President Jack Neil.  President Neil has a hostagecrisis to deal with while the murder investigation goes forward.Lambasted as being an ineffectual and indecisive president, his make-uphas him looking ready for the undertaker.  Alan Alda plays AlvinJordan, the president's National Security Advisor.       A high energy thriller with two good leads.  What more could youask for?  Well to start with, a plot with a tinge of plausibility and asupporting cast that was not embarrassing.  Nevertheless, Snipes andLane manage to carry the movie. ",Murder at 1600,R,1997,2.5

657,"""Napoleon Dynamite,"" which premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festivalto much fanfare, is a quirky, one-of-a-kind comedic gem. With echoesin tone to Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore,"" in style to Todd So londz's""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" and in feel to such adult-minded animatedtelevision shows as ""Daria"" and ""The Simpsons,"" writer-director JaredHess and cowriter Jerusha Hess have paid tribute to such influentialfilmmakers and genres without feeling the need to copy them. In tellingthe story of a group of lovable misfits at the bottom rung of thesocial ladder who somehow find a way to overcome their woes and keepmarching forward, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of the more consistentlycharming and original motion pictures of the last few months. Andeven when you aren't laughing out loud at the characters' antics andHess' droll humor, you won't be able to stop from smiling. In the rural, desperately uneventful midwest town of Preston, Idaho,17-year-old Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) stands out in a crowd. Equippedwith a full head of bushy red hair, almost always clad in snow boots,and with an eternal blank stare, Napoleon trudges through the doldrumsof his dysfunctiona l home life and miserable high school experienceas if he has long since accepted his lowly existence and has learnedto remain indifferent to anything that comes his way. When Grandma(Sandy Martin) is injured in a sand bike accident, smarmy Uncle Rico(Jon Gries) is sent to stay with Napoleon and his unemployed, chatroom-obsessed 32-year-old brother, Kip (Aaron Ruell), until she getsout of the hospital. As Kip teams with Uncle Rico on a corny get-rich-quickscheme and Uncle Rico begins to spread negative rumors around aboutNapoleon to better himself, Napoleon finds an unexpected ally in new-kid-in-schoolPedro (Efren Ramirez). When Pedro decides to run for class presidentagainst the popular, snobbish Summer Wheatley (Haylie Duff), he andNapoleon begin a seemingly hopeless campaign. Meanwhile, Napoleonbefriends the shy Deb (Tina Majorino), a cute wallflower who mightjust be his perfect match. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is light on a driving narrative, but hugely likable,nonetheless, as it follows its affectionate, offbeat characters througha few months in their shoes. Certain plot threads that threaten tocome off as cliches, such as the budding relationship between Napoleonand Deb or the high school campaign for president, bypass where onewould naturally expect them to lead and feel brand-new because ofit. Most appreciably of all, director Jared Hess (a 24-year-old makinghis promising feature debut) refuses to talk down to his audienceby spelling out every story development. He trusts that viewers aremore quick-witted than most films treat them (he would be right),and so he spares us the more commonplace scenes that go along withcomedies about teenagers. For example, when Napoleon and Deb end updancing together at the school dance, their conversation is awkward,but warm, leading to a silent reciprocal respect for each other thattranscends any dialogue Hess could have cooked up. And the scene,for once, doesn't end in a kiss. Lat er, when Deb gets mad at Napoleonover a misunderstanding, Hess drops the usual, tired apology and make-upsequence for something that is far more quiet and honest. More than anything, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a study in transcendentsimplicity. There are a lot of broad laughs, much of which comes fromNapoleon's outrageous behavior in certain circumstances, and somethat are more subtle, whether it be a zinger of a one-liner or a jokethat is carefully set up early on and paid off later. The portrayalof Grandma's bike accident; the funky dance Napoleon learns (froma tape called ""D-Kwon's Dance Moves"") that he puts to use during Pedro'selection; and the gift Kip's black Internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh(Shondrella Avery), gives him are just a few of the comic highlightsin a movie that has countless others. No matter. All of the comedyis successfully carried off without any winks to the audience, andthe characters have no idea that they are even in a comedy. That themovie is so very funny and never unveils that it knows it is the biggestkey to great comedy. The second anyone shows that they know they arefunny is the second the spell is lifted and it stops making one laugh.Fortunately, this never happens here. As the outlandish title character, Jon Heder (making his major filmdebut) superbly carries the film without ever seeming to try. Napoleonwalks through most of the film with a facial expression that resemblesa fog. Maybe he has been treated badly by his peers for so long thathe is worn out. Maybe he is unsure of whether or not to trust newfriends Pedro and Deb at the onset because he is afraid of gettinghurt. Or maybe it is the exact opposite, and he no longer is affectedby rejection, which is why he willingly hangs out with them. As kindredspirit Deb, Tina Majorino is easily the standout. Once a wonderfulchild actor in such films as 1994's ""When a Man Loves a Woman,"" 1994's'Corrina, Corrina,"" and 1995's 'Waterworld,"" Majorino ret urns aftera five year absence (her last project was 1999's television miniseriesof 'Alice in Wonderland"") all grown up and proving that maturity hasonly strengthened her abilities as an actress. Majorino is, at once,adorable and deeply touching, nearly the female equivalent of Heder'sNapoleon. She makes her every moment on screen come alive. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is that rare motion picture that reminds you ofa lot of other films while, at the same time, being unlike any othermovie you have ever seen. Director Jared Hess makes it his own, boththrough the unpredictably trajectory of the subplots and the innovationwith which he creates his ensemble. He also invigorates things withpeculiar, winning aesthetics; many of the fashions are right out ofthe '70s, most of the nostalgic music selections (such as ""The Promise""by When in Rome and ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper) are from the'80s, and the technology (the Internet, for example) is strictly ofa present-day men tality. It is as if this nowhere town in Idaho hasbeen stuck in a number of time warps, creating some weird sort ofmeshing of random decades. Most important, director Hess never seemsto be laughing at his characters. Even when it starts to seem likeit, Hess is quick to confirm at every turn that he really adores them,there is no question. By the time the lovely, lyrical final sceneof ""Napoleon Dynamite"" arrives, you have no choice but to nod in acknowledgment.Finally, and once and for all, it is crystal clear why these charactersdeserve to be loved.",Napoleon Dynamite,PG,2004,2.5
658,"I had a friend who, unlike the rest of our gang, did not become ateacher or an accountant or a dentist or doctor.  He had his heartset on wearing the blue for New York's finest.  When he joined theforce, his fianc‰ left him, as she had threatened to do.  Policework is stressful not only for the officers but for their families,forcing spouses to remain home alone or with their children duringmuch of the night hours and who worry each day whether theirhusbands or wives would even survive to the next day.  DirectorJoe Carnahan's ""Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane"" is, like hispresent work, an unconventional, low-budget crime story, but thistime Carnahan enjoys a stellar cast headed by Jason Patric asNick Tellis, an undercover narcotics officer, and Ray Liotta (whogained thirty pounds for the role to exude both physical andemotional bulk), who performs in the role of Tellis's partner, HenryOak.  Just minutes into the movie, you'll probably think, ""Wherehave I seen Jason Patric before?""  Patric had appeared in  Lili FiniZanuck's similar opus, ""Rush,"" about a young woman recruited tobe an undercover narc in the 1970s joining a man who's too strungout to be effective.     While ""Narc' is a character study even more than it is a crimethriller peppered with violence, Moscow-born photographer AlexNepomniaschy (""The End of Innocence"") captures the tension ofpolice work early on with a hand-held camera, using a blue filter tocapture Tellis chasing a suspected drug dealer, a stray bullet fromhis gun hitting a pregnant woman.  Suspended from the Detroitforce for eighteen months, he is given a chance by his boss (ChiMcBride) to have the event stricken from the record if he wouldbring in the person or persons who murdered an undercover narc,presumably because the latter had been found out by thepushers.  He is teamed up with Henry Oak, who was the partnerof the murdered cop and who is hell-bent on getting revenge.     ""Narc"" is not only a powerful crime story but an effectivepsychological thriller that includes a ""Rashomon"" theme.  Justhow did the unfortunate detective die?  Was he shot by thedealers when found out?  That appears to be the obvious answer,but things are seldom what they seem.  Carnahan treats us to abevy of Aqua-Velva blue flashbacks, each suggesting thecircumstances that surrounded the cop's death, revealing theunusual truth at the movie's conclusion.  In addition, we eavesdropon Tellis's family life, learning that his wife has become a shrewbecause Tellis is around when he should be home helping her tobathe and take care of their small child and is disgusted that herman chose to re-enter the Detroit force and take on the dangerousjob that led to his suspension.  For his part, we find out that Oakhas his own reasons for obsessing, his relationship with the deadman's widow an indication of his desire for closure.  The moviewas inspired by a documentary, ""The Thin Blue Line,"" about theactual slaying of a Dallas police officer in 1976, then made into ashort film by Carnahan called ""Gun Point.""      While Liotta is a powerhouse, chewing up the scenery with hisemotionalism, Patric's more intellectual performance is the key tothe film's success.  The thirty-six year old actor, a grandson ofJackie Gleason, creates a complex character, buffeted at homeby his nagging wife and on the job by his high-strung partner, yethe is able to convey his love for the only job for which he feelssuited.  Though he performed as ably in the similar ""Rush"" as hedoes in the current drama, he has shown depth in quite differentroles, particularly as a self-styled stud in Neil LaBute's drama ofdysfunctional couples, ""Your Friends and Neighbors.""  The teamof Liotta and Patric coupled with Carnahan's sharp script make""Narc"" a superior cop movie. ",Narc,R,2003,3
659,"The gross-out high school/college comedy genre has become so evidentin recent years that, seriously, could anything outside of actualpornography in a mainstream movie be shocking anymore? Since the raunchysexual jokes have become old hat, the key to the success of a filmlike this is all in the writing and characters, and whether they'reactually endearing and funny. ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder,"" a bidfor the title of the next ""Animal House"" of the new millennium, iscertainly not one of the worst entries in the ongoing saga of lewdcomedies, but it also lacks the originality and amount of laughs requiredto distinguish itself from the lot. Set at Coolidge College, Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) is a happy-go-luckyparty animal who holds the title of being in the university's undergraduateprogram for the longest amount of time: seven years. When Van's stern,high-powered father (Tim Matheson) discovers he has been basicallysquandering his money, determined to remain in college for as longas possible, he refuses to pay for any more of his schooling.  Meanwhile, aspiring school newspaper journalist Gwen Pearson (TaraReid) is called upon by her editor (Tom Everett Scott) to interviewVan and do an expose on him about why he is afraid to graduate andmove out into the real world. While trying to get her story, Gwencomes to find that Van is a truly sensitive, sweet guy, and beginsto doubt her relationship to her overly serious pre-med boyfriend,Richard (Daniel Cosgrove). Perhaps one of the biggest pitfalls of ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder""is that it is coming out only two weeks after the very similar, muchfunnier ""Sorority Boys,"" which it sorely pales next to. While VanWilder makes for a likable enough lead character, and is played withmucho charisma by Ryan Reynolds (1999's ""Dick""), the story he is stuckin remains unfocused and pedestrian. The movie lacks comic momentum,and even though some of the big comic centerpieces are good for acursory laugh, such as a yucky semen-laced eclair bit and anotherinvolving laxatives, far more often they just feel tiresome. Too manyscenes also fall into the trap of trying to shock and disgust forthe sake of being gross, rather than to serve the story at all. The""American Pie"" movies, in comparison, had their bawdy moments, butthe majority of time they were placed within for a reason. Speaking of which, ""American Pie"" alum Tara Reid turns up as Gwen,Van's potential love interest. She does okay with what she's given,but this is not one of her standout performances. Too often she justlooks bored in her role. Likewise, the romance between the two isn'tdeveloped enough to be notably effective. ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"" isn't boring, and it doesn't reachthe lowest-common-denominator in the annals of college flicks (theabysmal ""Slackers"" made sure of that earlier this year). At the sametime, director Walt Becker and screenwriters Brent Goldberg and DavidWagner coast right along, happy to line up a set of wacky, albeitbanal, sight gags without bringing anything particularly creativeto the table. ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"" may aim to be the next""Animal House,"" but it more closely resembles this year's version of ""Tomcats.""",National Lampoon's Van Wilder,R,2002,1.5
660,"""National Security"" is living proof why January is often called amovie graveyard--the month where a studio's weakest movies are unceremoniouslydumped for a lack of either commercial viability or quality. Directedby Dennis Dugan (2001's ""Saving Silverman""), ""National Security"" mayat first glance look like nothing more than another harmless formulabuddy action-comedy, but it isn't. Within the first ten minutes, itbecomes readily apparent that it has a non-too-subtle racist agendathat is thoroughly unfunny and repellent. First, the disposable plot. Earl (Steve Zahn) is a cop mourning theuntimely death of his partner, who was shot in the line of duty. Hank(Martin Lawrence) is a would-be LAPD recruit kicked off the trainingprogram because of his antisocial behavior. When Earl mistakenly thinksthat Hank is trying to break into a car and threatens to arrest him,a scuffle ensues. Unfortunately, from the bad angle that the incidentwas caught on camera, it looks as if Earl was beating Hank up, whenin actuality he was only trying to swat a bumblebee that had begunto attack the allergic Hank. Taking advantage of the racially chargedincident, Hank insists he was, indeed, beat up, leading to Earl'srevoked police badge and a six-month jail sentence. Once Earl is released, he promptly gets a job as a security guardin hopes of getting his life straightened out. What he doesn't realizeis that Hank has also gotten a job from the same employer. When asmuggling ring secretly working in the area is detected, Earl andHank become unlikely partners in trying to catch the criminals. This premise, while worn-out and mostly uninteresting, would havebeen all well and good on its own. Instead, the screenwriting teamwho brought the unsuspecting public 2002's ""I Spy,"" Jay Scherick andDavid Ronn, with generous help from Martin Lawrence's ad-libbing,have joined forces to make a sickening 90-minute diatribe againstwhite people. Lawrence (2000's ""Big Momma's House"") can be funny underthe right circumstances, but here he is merely offensive, with nearlyevery line he utters exposing his narrow-minded racism.  Making a statement about race relations can be smartly used as thesource of comedy (2002's ""Undercover Brother"" being a prime recentexample), but there is no point behind it and no statement to be madehere. Hank is such a crass, meanspirited, lying idiot that it comesas laughable that the viewer is supposed to root for him. Tellingly,as he hung from a seaside cliff in the climax, the only thing runningthrough my mind was that the world would be better off if he fellto his death. I doubt this was the intention of the filmmakers, buttheir carelessness in bringing this morally repugnant character tothe screen has managed just that. The only actor who escapes with most of their dignity is Steve Zahn(2001's ""Joy Ride""), as the put-upon Earl. While Zahn has been offerednothing witty to say in the screenplay, he still has created a sympatheticcharacter. We, as the viewers, feel sorry for him when he unjustlyloses his job and girlfriend, and then feel even more sorry for himwhen he is forced to put up with Hank, who is the apathetic source of his problems. ""National Security"" isn't just a poor man's version of ""48 Hours""or ""Rush Hour,"" but an unbearable experience that fails to generatea single solid laugh throughout. The sporadic action setpieces aremore tolerable, but strictly of the ""been-there-done-that"" variety.More than anything, though, ""National Security"" is repulsive in itsmisguided double standards. Had the roles been reversed, and the whiteEarl been the racist one, you can bet people would riot the theaters.Since it is the African American Hank, however, who has somethingagainst Caucasians, it is widely accepted as just a silly comedy.""National Security"" is one, big, hypocritical ""fuck you"" to everyone.",National Security,PG-13,2003,1
661,"For an action-adventure produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (2003's ""BadBoys II""), he of the rapid-fire, Attention Deficit Disorder editingand superficial approach to characterization, ""National Treasure""stays mostly within said boundaries even as it is more tame and lessgrating than most. Fruitlessly directed with occasional finesse byJon Turteltaub (2000's ""The Kid""), the plotting is hard-to-swallowbut not really to be taken seriously. When the film sets its sighton the central chase, the chirpy pacing keeps things engaging. Whenthe stick-figure character types posing as human beings are forcedto talk, however, viewers may find themselves cringing to an overwhelmingdegree. This is one screenplay„credited to Jim Kouf (2004's ""Taxi""),Cormac Wibberley, and Marianne Wibberley (2002's ""I Spy"")„that wouldhave excelled had all the dialogue been excised or retooled. Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage), a present-day descendant fromthe time of the nation's Founding Fathers, comes from a long lineof men who believed the myth that a treasure was hidden by the FreeMasons. With best friend and associate Riley Poole (Justin Bartha)by his side, Ben has made it his life's ambition to prove its existence.When an expedition to the Arctic Circle leads him to a clue signalingthat an invisible map is hidden on the back of the Declaration ofIndependence, he is abruptly double-crossed by his shady partner,Ian Howe (Sean Bean), who wants the treasure for himself. Now thechase is on, with Ben and Riley devising a plan to steal the Declarationof Independence and follow the cryptic clues to the treasure as away of thwarting Ian's plan, with the FBI in hot pursuit. Joiningthem on their journey from Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia to NewYork City is National Archives curator Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger),whose initial skepticism makes way for a personal stake in finding the long-lost treasure. Far-fetched as it may be, ""National Treasure"" carries a fascinatingundercurrent as it follows Ben, Riley, and Abigail on a wild goosechase from city to city and from one clue to the next. The cinematographyby Caleb Deschanel (2004's ""The Passion of the Christ"") is richlytextured, making vivid use of its location shooting in the aforementionedcities„even if, in D.C., every single exterior sequence happens totake place in front of the capitol's many historical landmarks„whilethe editing by William Goldenberg (2003's ""Seabiscuit"") keeps thingsnicely taut. There are instances where the movie almost becomes fun,particularly in the theft of the Declaration of Independence„a clever,involving heist that is far and beyond a similar, inferior scene inthe recent ""After the Sunset""„and during an attempted getaway throughthe streets, buildings, and even cemeteries of Philadelphia. Leaving one's brain in the theater lobby is advised, though, as theamount of plot holes stack up to undeniable lengths. The effortlessnesswith which Ben is able to figure out the most enigmatic of clues ispreposterous, and director Jon Turteltaub barely makes an attemptto explain the conclusions he comes up with in a comprehensible manner.Meanwhile, Ian and his cronies, who are all evil for the reason thatthese types of movies always need bad guys, seem to know much morethan they logically would at the most opportune of times, just sothere can be close-call chases between them and the trio of well-intended protagonists. Even if the quick nature of the plotting ratchets some engrossment,less interesting and more vague is the point behind all of it. NicolasCage (2003's ""Matchstick Men""), a gifted, far-ranging actor who canswitch effortlessly between lofty, independent-minded features andbig-budget actioners, is so good he rarely even calls attention tohimself. Instead, he becomes his characters, as he does all of them.What Cage cannot do as Benjamin Gates is provide a plausible reasonfor why he cares so much about finding the treasure. Sure, he wantsto prove his naysayers wrong, but then what? No fault of Cage's, butthe screenplay doesn't seem too interested in delving into his character'spassion and making it stand for something. Additionally, the romancethat pops up in the second half between himself and Abigail occursbecause the conventions of the genre demand it, not because thereis any true connection between these two individuals. Diane Kruger, who was vacuous as Helen in 2004's ""Troy"" and not muchimproved in 2004's ""Wicker Park,"" is looser and more likable as AbigailChase. She actually has presence this time around, and it's a fortunatething; her role is big on charm and nonexistent in depth. Roundingout the three explorers, Justin Bartha (2003's ""Gigli""), as Riley,is saddled with that most insufferable of clich_s„the jokester sidekick.Bartha tries with all of his might to make something out of a stocktrait, but to no avail. He, and his every flat-footed one-liner, iswretchedly unfunny. In smaller turns, Jon Voight (2004's ""The ManchurianCandidate"") plays Benjamin's father, who has yet to become a believerin the hidden treasure, and Harvey Keitel's (2002's ""Red Dragon"")useless part as the lead FBI agent on Ben's trail could have, andshould have, been played by an actor of lesser abilities. Keitel'swasted appearance merely calls attention to itself. In a season of bigger, more imaginative motion pictures (""The PolarExpress,"" ""The Incredibles"") and smaller, more rewarding ones (""Sideways,""""Alfie""), ""National Treasure"" is a middle-of-the-road trifle. ItsPG rating is, no doubt, intended to draw in families, but with itsadventure aspects frequently skimmed over in favor of thriller elementsand all of the characters being adults, children will be bored. Asfor the adults in the audience, their attention spans will be satiated,but not to any memorable end. The closing credits of ""National Treasure""signal a squandering of creative potential with a lazy screenplayafraid to take on a personality to call its own. ",National Treasure,PG,2004,2.5
662,"There are probably many ways to classify connoisseurs ofmodern cinema. One of them is to divide them into two verydistinct camps - those who worship Oliver Stone's 1994 filmNATURAL BORN KILLERS as the ultimate cinematic masterpieceof its time and those who think of it as nothing more thancelluloid equivalent of an horse manure on hot desert road.The author of this review usually avoids extreme opinionsand tries to reach middle ground whenever possible. However,in the case of NATURAL BORN KILLERS such efforts werefruitless. I was forced to take one of those extreme standsand I took the latter one.  There are many reasons why my dislike of NATURAL BORNKILLERS takes dimensions beyond those reserved for usualHollywood stinkers. One of them is the fact that OliverStone used all two hours of this film as an opportunity toshow the world that he could master all visual techniques offilmmaking. This demonstration includes use of both colourand black-and-white photography, 35mm and Super 8, variousfilm stock, slow-motion, fast-motion, all possible cameraangles and all possible ways camera can record light.Unfortunately, rapid editing is also part of thisdemonstration and the ultimate impression comes in the formof nausea for many unfortunate souls who were introduced toNATURAL BORN KILLERS in theatres (same effect is lessvisible among those viewers, who were wise to watch thisfilm on video, in much safer environment of their ownhomes).  Of course, some of Stone's supporters claim that theaforementioned nausea was the aim of this film. This nauseawas supposed to be the only way for Oliver Stone to deliverhis Message to masses, who would miss it in the hands ofmore conventional director. This Message, however, wassupposed to come from the original script by QuentinTarantino - dark satire about American media obsession withcrime and violence. Unfortunately, this script came to thehands of Oliver Stone and two of his co-writers - DannyVeloz and Richard Rutowsky. Their treatment of Tarantino'stext was probably equal to the way Jack the Ripper hadtreated London women, so Tarantino disowned his screenplay.  The protagonists of this film are two outcasts - Mickey Knox(played by Woody Harrelson) and his girlfriend MalloryWilson (played by Juliette Lewis). Starting with Mallory'sabusing father Ed (played by Rodney Dangerfield) two of themengage in the series of random killings. Since they alwaysleave a witness after their killing sprees and since theyalways take credit for the murders, this pair of serialkillers is turned into media celebrities. They are equallyhounded by psychopathic lawman Jack Scagnetti (played by TomSizemore) and scruples TV show host Wayne Gale (played byRobert Downey Jr.). Their capture and trial is not the endof their killing spree nor of media madness - Wayne Gale iscoming to prison, run by sadistic warden Dwight McClusky(played by Tommy Lee Jones) in order to make exclusive TVinterview with Mickey that would lead to the new cycle ofviolence.  If we are to believe Oliver Stone and many of the criticswho hailed this work as masterpiece, NATURAL BORN KILLERSwas supposed to be something like a wake-up call to America,celluloid protest against media-induced national obsessionwith crime and violence, condemnation of the culture thatturns psychopathic killers into heroes of popular culture.Unfortunately, Stone's film, despite the intentions of theauthor, turned into something quite different. Unable toresist his urges to turn this film into his life-longpersonal crusade against Establishment, and lacking anysense of subtlety, Stone watered down his originalintentions by redirecting his anger and unleashing hiscreative demons on too many targets at once - media, lawenforcement, family, society and civilisation in general. Inthe end, this film totally misses the point and turns intothe exact thing Stone wanted to criticise - by showingMickey and Mallory as heroes, romantic rebels whose lovestranscends traditional morality, Stone glamorises violence,murder and all the most virulent forms of sociopathicbehaviour.  The last and most sinister aspect of NATURAL BORN KILLERSrevealed itself to the author of this review in real life.Few years ago I witnessed rather unpleasant scene involvingcertain menacing but obviously drugged-out individual whowas trying to intimidate persons around them by publiclyproclaiming his love for NATURAL BORN KILLERS. This littleincident corresponded with series of media reports aboutreal life acts of violence being inspired by NATURAL BORNKILLERS (or, to be more precise, their perpetrators tryingto diminish their own responsibility by putting all theblame on Stone's work). And all those reports, hyped out ofproportions (like Columbine massacre and alleged MATRIXinfluence), can serve certain political agendas - agendasthat manifest themselves in strengthened censorship,suspension of individual rights and other measures thatwould increase power of the same institutions Stone tried toattack in his film. When this happens, failure of NATURALBORN KILLERS would be complete. ",Natural Born Killers,R,1994,0.5
663,"If we are to believe a character in NELL, 1994 dramadirected by Michael Apted, everyone has an ulterior motive,even Mother Theresa. Finding those ulterior motives isdifficult and sometimes impossible, but in the case of thosewho made this film it is rather easy - whole purpose of thisendeavour was to bring another Academy Award to itsprincipal actress Jodie Foster.  The plot of this film, based on the play IDIOGLOSSIA by MarkHandley, begins in the remote backwoods of North Carolina. Awoman who lived her most of her life in a remote cabin hasdied and country doctor Jerome Lovell (played by LiamNeeson) discovers her daughter Nell (played by JodieFoster). Young woman has been taught to hide from the worldand it seems that she has never seen another human beingapart from her mother. Since the mother suffered aspeech-impairing stroke, Nell never learned to speak properEnglish and instead developed unintelligible language of herown. Authorities, represented by psychologist Dr. PaulaOlsen (played by Natasha Richardson), are convinced thatNell can't function in outside world and that her interestswould be best served if she is institutionalised. Lovellthinks that she should remain free and manages to delaycourt decision for three months. In that period both Lovelland Olsen must observe Nell in her natural surroundings andpresent their findings to the court. Lovell tries to usethis as an opportunity to decipher Nell's language andfinally establish proper communication.  The plot of NELL deals with very intriguing subject - roleof the society and civilisation in forming human mind.Previously this subject was tackled by such great directorslike Francois Truffaut and Werner Herzog. British directorMichael Apted is not exactly in their league, but his careerindicates that he is capable of making decent film out ofthis material. Unfortunately, he was not capable ofcompensating the inadequacy of William Nicholson's script.The script, same as anything else in the film, was subjectedto the single purpose - create as many opportunities aspossible for Jodie Foster to show her ability to portraysocially handicapped character. Because of that, the movieis stuffed with scenes in which Foster talks gibberish orlives in her own private world. Naturally, those scenes lasttoo long and Foster, despite all of her talent, becomesirritating after a while. The plot that is supposed to wrapup this character is even worse, filled with all Hollywoodcliches that culminate in the corny and quite predictablefinale. The only thing that makes this film watchable is asplendid photography by Dante Spinotti that captures naturalbeauties of North Carolina. But those lovely sights arehardly a reason for viewers to spend almost two hours oftheir life to watch this single- purpose (and failed)effort. ",Nell,PG-13,1994,1
664,"      THE NEON BIBLE is a innovative film by Terence Davies, who did theacclaimed DISTANT VOICES, STILL LIVES.  THE NEON BIBLE has a highlyconfusing narrative but with much technical brilliance underneath.  Itis a hard picture to describe since it is a collage of images from aboy's past.  These brief snippets of his recollections are gluedtogether with a massive infusion of old time songs (""The Old RuggedCross"", ""Chattanooga Choo Choo"", ""Tara's Theme"", ""Dixie"", and manyothers).       The plot, to the extent there is any, has to do with David (JacobTierney at age 15 and Drake Bell at age 10) being on a nighttime trainwhile visualizing his past.  The movie is shown in flashbacks.       His mother Sarah (Diana Scarwid) is close to being sent to amental institution.  His father Frank (Denis Leary) is a factory workerwho has lost his job.  Staying with them is his high spirited Aunt Mae(Gena Rowlands).  Aunt Mae is a mediocre singer who lives in thememories of her theatrical career and longs to return to the stage.Although it is by a British director, it is set in a Southern UnitedStates Bible Belt town in the 40s.       The acting is passable.  Leary, who specializes in overacting,this time is in control in his small part.  Rowlands is the best of thelot, but below average for her.  Scarwid is over the top and notbelievable.  My biggest problem is with Tierney who approaches thecharacter of David with such detachment.  Rarely does he waste timeshowing any emotion and yet, this is David's life we are seeing so youwould expect more animation.  Quite a boring performance.       The dialog by the director, based on the novel by John KennedyToole, is sparse and eclectic.  Many scenes have little or no dialog.It is the sort of show that has you staring for a long time trying tofigure out where the show is going and why.  I did not know the show'slength and actually thought it was ending after half an hour.  Afterone hour into the show, the picture begins to make some sense, butnever comes together.  At the end, I found myself thinking what a mess,but yet there are many magical and special parts of this disappointingmovie.       Let's not waste any more time on what is wrong with THE NEONBIBLE.  There are technical aspects so special that were they in abetter film, they could have been spectacular.       First and foremost is the wonderful camera work and cinematographyby Mick Coulter (GREGORY'S GIRL, LOCAL HERO, COMFORT AND JOY, and FOURWEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL).  Let me cite just three examples.  When theywant to age David by five years, he stands with his back to the camerawhile facing a large moon, and in the translucent moonlight, he isslowly morphed into a boy five years older as if they were usingtime-lapsed photography.       Second, the scene transitions frequently start high up, like inthe stars, and then move down slowly into the scene like a memory mightstart in your subconscious and then slowly form.  Editor Charles Reesdeserves some of the credit too for the magical transitions.  Third, inthe scene at night of a revival all of the people's faces are lit bygaslight as if God's radiance is the source instead.       In the press kit, Davies discusses the look of the film.  Whereasin his last two shows he used a special lab process to desaturate thecolor, this time he went for a full saturation.  Since the show isabout memories he wanted the lighting ""to be rich or accentuate thechiaroscuro.""       The sets by Christopher Hobbs (EDWARD II) are accurate andevocative of the small country towns of the south.  I especially likedthe Nehi drink signs on the stores.  This is a grape drink I rememberdrinking as a little boy in the south.  You could get one of those fora nickel and for fifteen cents more you could have a hamburger too.       The dialog, when there is any, does have a few good lines.  Themost thought provoking is David's, ""If you were different from anybodyelse in town, you had to get out.  They used to say in school, 'youhave to think for yourself,' but you couldn't do that in town.  Youhave to think what your father thought and that was what everybodythought.""       I will be happy if someday writers describing the south of thatera will not feel obligated to include a Ku Klux Klan scene as this onedid.  I grew up in the south just after this time, and I never saw aKKK rally in my entire life, and I don't know anybody that ever has.Yes, they happened, but they were fairly rare.  Writers should not feelobliged to include them, especially as the scene here is superfluous tothe story.       THE NEON BIBLE runs 1:31.  I do not believe film is rated.  Thereis no sex, nudity, or bad language that I can remember.  There is amild amount of violence.  Except for a single brief violent scene, itwould probably get a PG rating.  As it stands, I think it is PG-13material.  The show will bore most kids, but any kid over say 8 or 9should be able to watch it.  I sat there with my mouth agape in most ofthe show so I certainly can not recommend it, but for its technicalbrilliance I do give it **. ","Neon Bible, The",NR,1996,2

Tired of sufferingthrough his senior year at Rock Creek High, Dizzy purposefully getshimself expelled and transferred to East Highland High. Before makinghis grand appearance at his new school, a stop in jail leads to acrash course on acting cool by friendly inmate Luther (Eddie Griffin).Once at East Highland, he discovers that the cliques run rampant justlike at his old school, but he successfully wins popularity afterbeating up the class bully (Ross Patterson) and winning the heartof cheerleader Danielle (Eliza Dushku). The art of being popular,however, means sacrificing the respect of his tried-and-true old friendsfor a group of artificial ones. A cross between ""Never Been Kissed,"" ""10 Things I Hate About You,""and, now that I think about it, every teen comedy released in thelast 15 years, ""The New Guy"" has been equipped with a shallow screenplay,by television writer David Kendall, and some of the sloppiest editingof the year. So messy is the storytelling that the sequential placementof scenes occasionally make little to no sense. For example, Dizzymakes several trips to jail, but there is no reasoning for why hehas been sent there in the first place. At another point, Dizzy catchescompletely on fire, and in the next shot, his clothes aren't even singed. DJ Qualls, so winning in 2000's ""Road Trip,"" is one of the few reasons""The New Guy"" is actually tolerable. A charismatic, unconventionalperformer who always manages to be likable, Qualls is a person worthrooting for. Likewise, Eliza Dushku (2001's ""Jay and Silent Bob StrikeBack"" and 2000's ""Bring It On""), as kind-hearted love interest Danielle,has a radiant presence that is mostly wasted on run-of-the-mill cliches.Her big moment in the spotlight is an extended montage where she modelsbikinis for Dizzy as if she's on a runway in Paris. The less said about the supporting players and pointless cameos, thebetter. Some good actors are present, including Zooey Deschanel (2002's""Big Trouble"" and 2000's ""Almost Famous""), as Nora, and Illeana Douglas(2001's ""Ghost World""), as a horribly inept guidance counselor, butthis film should stand as an embarrassment on their resumes. Further cementing the desperation on the filmmakers' parts are unfunnytake-offs from scenes in ""Braveheart,"" ""Patton,"" and ""Urban Cowboy.""As far as I can tell, the only reasons ""The New Guy"" was ever filmedwas to (1) show off an admittedly fun soundtrack, and (2) to soaka few dollars out of unsuspecting teen audiences. The joke will hopefullybe on the studio, as actual teenagers are far smarter than this movie purports them to be.","New Guy, The",PG-13,2002,1

669,"    Director Douglas McGrath (""Emma""), who tackled the nearly-impossible task of reducing Dickens's popular novel, ""NicholasNickleby,"" to just 130 minutes, believes that the author is theworld's greatest storyteller.  Why so?  In his introduction to thePenguin paperback, released at the time of the opening of his newmovie, he cites plot, character, dialogue, and Dickens's obsessionwith making the world a kinder place.  Storyteller, no doubt, whenyou consider that England's most important Nineteenth Centurynovelist is concerned not only with keeping our eye on the centraltheme but on shooting the breeze with stories within storieswhether or not any of them has anything to do with the book'sspine.     You couldn't convince me of Dickens's worth when I was back inprep school, a snobbish place based on the British idea ofeducation, which consisted of calling classes ""forms,"" thecafeteria ""the commons,"" and eschewed the kinds of books wewanted to read such as Orwell's 99-page ""Animal Farm"" ratherthan the 1,000-page, small-print ""Nicholas Nickleby.""  Now thatI've advanced in years I probably would still opt to do book reportson ""Animal Farm,"" but I've come to appreciate the delectably long-winded Dickensians tracts especially when the thousand pagescan be reduced to a comfortably brief whirl of celluloid.     Critics, pretended that they've all seen the Royal ShakespeareCompany's nine-hour stage version of what we in prep schoolcalled ""Nick-Nick,"" are likely to say that none of the half-dozenmovie versions (dating back to 1903) can compare.  NonethelessMr. McGrath's film is a pure holiday delight and, I dare say, fit fora pleasant diversion on the big screen 'most any time of the year.     In whittling down the book, eliminating minor character whosenames are so peculiar you'd think that the author was spoofing hissociety-Gregsby, Graymarsh, Cobbey, Mobbs, Belvawney,Grudden, Curdle, Pyke, Knag, Mulberry Hawk, Bobster,Petowker; but keeping others with equally quaint names likeWackford Squeers, Newman Noggs, Smike and Bray-McGrathMcGrath emphasizes the comic touches to keep Mr. Dickenssmiling in his grave.  After all, you can't better society by somedull preaching: you have to keep the audience in their seats first,keep 'em smiling and laughing.  Then throw in the compassionateliberalism.     Thematically, Dickens is most concerned with the glories offamily, but not in the banal and insincere concept of politicianslike Dan Quayle but in the idea of the extended family, the familyof human beings rather than simply those who blood types weshare.  At the center of the book and the movie is the titlecharacter (Charlie Hunnam), happily living with his sister Kate(Romola Garai) and mother (Stella Gonet) in a Devonshire cottagesurrounded by green, then becoming as lost as an Appalachiancoal miner suddenly thrust alone into New York's RockefellerCenter.  When Nickleby's father (Andrew Havill) dies when the boyis nineteen, Nicholas goes to London with his sister Kate andmother, hoping to get aid from Mr. Nickleby's brother Ralph(Christopher Plummer)-a moneylender and scrooge who proves tobe the chief villain of the drama.  Ralph gets Nicholas a job asassistant to the one-eyed Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent),who operates a terrible boarding school in Yorkshire into whichcast-aways are deposited, starved and beaten.  When Squeersand his wife (Juliet Stevenson) beat the dickens out of onecrippled castaway, Smike (Jamie Bell), Nicholas ""adopts"" the ladand runs away with him in search of adventure.  At this point theroad-and-buddy movie begins with adventures designed to restoreNicholas to a sense of family coupled with a need to avengehimself on his uncle.  While the marriage of Nicholas to oneMadeline Bray (Anne Hathaway) and of his sister Kate to a decentguy of her own are inevitable in a holiday story that must have ahappy ending, Nicholas enjoys particularly delightful times on theway especially with a theatrical troupe headed by VincentCrummles (Nathan Lane), including his wife (Dame EdnaEverage), and a Highland dancer played by the always amusingAlan Cummings.     ""Nicholas Nickleby"" could be the breakthrough performance ofhandsome Charlie Hunnam, whom we left not so long ago fordead, stoned at the hands of Katie Holmes in Stephen Gaghan's""Abandon.""  The trouble is that Nicholas is such a one-dimensional sweet guy that Mr. Hunnam does not get a chancefrom the script to strut his stuff.  Sure, he raises his fist onceagainst a rich investor, Newman Noggs (Tom Courtenay) whoinsulted his sister by hitting on her shamelessly during aperformance of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and he gets the drop on theschoolmaster, giving him a whipping as an object lesson, but forthe most part he's given to squeaky-clean moralism andShakespearean statements to his love-at-first-sight girl friend.  Asa result, we're drawn more to the two villains, both of whom turn inrollicking performances.  Jim Broadbent's role as sadisticschoolmaster gets him to ham things up, one eye closed as hehad lost his vision early on both physically and morally, helpinghim to eat up the scenery whenever he appears.  Best of all,Christopher Plummer, dignified as a robber baron must be, hasthe juicy job of turning from the moneyed head of his extendedfamily and one who gives ""family values"" a bad name, to hiscomeuppance when everything caves in at once.     I'd like to think that Douglas McGrath's film will encourage hisaudience to go out and get the Penguin book, but then, we're afast-paced, Cliff-Notes addicted society more likely to pick up thelatest self-help book from Barnes and Noble than anything writtenbefore the year 2000.  That being the case, you can't go wrong bytaking in Dickens-light.  ""Nicholas Nickleby"" gives us all the moralvision, the rich characters, the love of storytelling that CharlesDickens has willed to his family of millions. ",Nicholas Nickleby,PG,2002,3
670,"      Ready for the first completely real-time movie since ROPE?  Readyto hyperventilate?  With NICK OF TIME Writers Patrick Duncan and EbbeRoe Smith have come up with an innovative script that starts at noon onMay the second and rushes like a runaway train to a preannounced climaxat 1:30 PM.  The screenwriters tell you this and then director JohnBadham carefully choreographs the actors so that the movie itself takesexactly one hour and thirty minutes to get there.  Since the dizzyingcinematography by Roy Wagner keeps focusing in on every clock in sight,the audience becomes obsessed with the time.       The plot is fairly simple.  Some bad guys led by Mr. Smith(Christopher Walken) and his sidekick Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia) find aninnocent passenger, Gene Watson (Johnny Depp), and his 5 year olddaughter, Lynn Watson (Courtney Chase), getting off the Amtrak trainthat arrives at noon in LA.  They tell Gene that either he agrees tokill the governor of California, Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason), by 1:30PM or Ms. Jones will kill his little girl.  Gene doesn't understand soMr. Smith repeats his instructions with a carefully paced cadence, ""Itis now 12:16.  If she is alive at 1:30, I call my partner, and yourdaughter is dead.""       After many futile attempts to escape, a la the typical innocentvictim of circumstance from a Hitchcock film, Gene begins to realizethat the Mr. Smith is both omniscient and omnipresent.  Whenever Geneis just about to summon help, Mr. Smith appears and warns him that anyfunny business and his little girl will be gone forever.       Early on we find out that the reason the governor is in trouble isthat she ran as a conservative but turned liberal once elected, and theconservative special interest groups are angry, especially thoserepresented by the mysterious man identified in the credits only as theMystery Man.  The Mystery Man is played by the veteran actor, G. D.Spradlin, who was the original evil politician from the Godfather, thesenator that defies the Godfather and then gets a dead horse's head putin bed with him.  As the governor's husband, Brendan Grant, we havePeter Strauss.  One of the best minor characters is that of a hotelshoe shiner named Huey and played by Charles Dutton.  Huey is a realcharacter who dispenses free advice on life while shining shoes, and heis one who Gene turns to for help.       I will not reveal any more details of the movie since working yourway through the maze of the plot in real-time is something you shouldexperience yourself.  Suffice it to say that it is wrapped up nicelyalthough you think it is such a conundrum that there is no reasonableway to end it.  Moreover, it even has a neat and brief epilogue withone of the key minor characters.       Johnny Depp is an actor who can play an amazing range charactersfrom his everyman role in NICK OF TIME to the ones in ED WOOD, BENNYAND JOON, and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.  Here he is low key but quiteeffective.  I was disappointed by Christopher Walken.  Usually hedominates any scene he is in with his explosive or potentiallyexplosive behavior.  Here the director had him under too tight a leash.Peter Strauss never even attempts acting in the movie.  His role couldhave added to the tension, but Strauss's lack of energy only serves todampen it.  G. D. Spradlin played his part as a cliche of an evilmillionaire, but the role demanded better.  My favorite actor in themovie was Marsha Mason.  She was totally believable and brought a lotto a small but crucial role.  She plays a spunky politician that looksa little like California Senator Barbara Boxer.  Here Mason manages tobe both in command as a Governor and vulnerable as a human being whenfaced with a mad assassin.       The script is fun, and the real-time aspects work.  The dialog isnothing special however, and most of the characters should have beenbetter written.  The cinematography is outstanding on many levels inthe way it conveys the hopelessness and the confusion of the maincharacter.  We get unsteady views as if from Gene's eyes.  In otherscenes extreme wide angles are used to show how distorted the worldfeels to him.  In still other scenes we have rapid zoom outs to showhow isolated he is.  The glass elevator in the hotel is used as ametaphor in the camera work to show how vulnerable Gene is.  Finally,the sets by Philip Harrison and the music by Arthur Rubinstein help toportray the overwhelming feeling of desperation.       NICK OF TIME runs, and I do mean runs, a little over an hour and ahalf.  It is rated R for some bad language and some shot 'em upviolence, but without much blood.  There is no sex or nudity.  I thinkit is a soft R, and I would have no problems with teenagers going.  Onefamily in our theater brought in their 3 and 8 year olds, which wasjust plain stupid - it is not PG-13 material.  I recommend the movie toyou and give it ** 1/2. ",Nick of Time,R,1995,2
671,"         This clunky, clueless comedy is aimed directly at the""Saturday Night Live"" crowd, as producer Lorne Michaels takes a simpleskit and fashions a full-length feature, directed by JohnFortenberry.

Not that they know much about it, ofcourse, since most of their time is spent babe-watching.

Think Studio 54. Orcould they? On such a trivial premise, an entire film has beenconstructed.  Dan Hedaya is their gruff father, who owns afake-flowers shop in Beverly Hills, while Loni Anderson, as theirplastic surgery-addicted mom, flashes what appear to be huge,collagen-enhanced lips. Chazz Palmintieri plays the paranoid clubowner (wisely without billing) and Richard Grieco appears as theButabi brothers' favorite celebrity, not much of a stretch. On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""A Night at the Roxbury"" is a goofy,tepid 3 - about two silly, senseless simpletons. ","Night at the Roxbury, A",PG-13,1998,1

They each tell the stories of theiraffairs to the journalist while sipping espresso in a quaint coffeeshop in what appears to be San Francisco.       Nina's friend's lover (Fisher Stevens) is a guy with a scruffybeard who makes perfect espresso at another coffee place.  This isdefinitely a 90s movie.  We have heavy drinking in half of the scenes,and it is all great coffee.  The 50s movies featured beer drinkingregular guys.  The 60s flicks were filled with young people doingdrugs.  In the 70s we had cocktails and certainly in the 80s we sawlots of wine, especially white wine as the beverage of choice.  I guesswith the 90s here, rather than having characters being plastered andpassing out, we will have them wired and hyperactive.  But I digress.       NINA TAKES A LOVER is a movie where not much happens and the toneof it all is highly subdued which is reflected in the dreamy music.Overall, this can be a very soporific movie so don't go to the 9:30showing.  I would expect that the reaction of most people seeing thismovie will range from mild boredom to a mild rapport with thecharacters.  It is not a movie that is easy to get excited about or todislike.       Laura San Giacomo who was so wonderful, as was everyone else, inSEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, plays a fairly reserved lover in this movie.Her husband goes out of town for three weeks so she get bored and looksto find a lover.  Her married friend is ahead of her and already hashers.  Spouses are not visible or talked about much--romance is.       The script and the directing were done by Alan Jacobs who neededto put more oomph in both.  I like the characters he created, but Ikept hoping in vain for them to come alive.  Jacobs seemed interestedin creating a mood piece with a message.  He succeeded in the formeralthough I wish he had more ambitious goals, and he failed in thelatter.       The cinematography by Phil Parmet was a little unusual.  In orderto emphasis the separateness of people in a relationship he wasconstantly filling the frame with one person and then panning over tothe other.  It was a technique I could have done without.       The script makes an attempt at a big switch towards the end of themovie.  I did not like nor buy this part at all.  It felt as if theyhad gotten bad scores when test marketing the show, and they tacked onthe changes as an attempt to make the movie more involving and to wakeup the audience. ",Nina Takes a Lover,R,1995,1.5

As is sopopular today, the couple is living together without being married andhence are being subsidized by those of us foolish enough to admit toour government that we are.       A child psychologist, Samuel (Hugh Grant) and a ballet teacher,Rebecca (Julianne Moore) are the unmarried, childless couple.  Samuelis head over heels in love with Rebecca and feels that they are livingin a state of bliss that is ""dangerously close to perfection"".  Rebeccaasks him if he ""wants more"".  He thinks she means food, but she meanskids.  As luck would have it, her birth control proves to be ""three percent bloody ineffective"".       Upon learning of the coming baby, Samuel panics, but Rebecca turnsjoyous.  Samuel, in a running series of sight gags, keeps visualizingher as a praying mantis coming after him since he is told that thefemale praying mantis eats her male after a successful mating.Although crude, this reoccurring scene manages to be funny every time.       Their human gynecologist (Robin Williams) is a recently immigratedRussian animal gynecologist, and Rebecca is his first human patient.Williams is hilarious.  He mispronounces every term possible andmanages to keep the audience in stitches with every joke.       The director of the movie, Chris Columbus, has done many goodmovies, but my personal favorites of his are MRS. DOUBTFIRE andADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING.  In NINE MONTHS, I am sad to report, hedelivers a highly uneven movie.  Sometimes the jokes work and othertimes, they are quite tedious.       The script, also by Chris Columbus, is based on a French movie ofthe same name.  Columbus's script oscillated between great humor andmean spiritedness.  The worst example being when two of the menstarting using a baseball bat to violently beat a man in a Barney typecostume.       The script did shine in parts.  The ride to the hospital being thebest.  It was fresh, fast paced, and enormously funny.  For an insidejoke, watch what is on the movie marquee when they race past it in oneof the scenes.  Finally, if you see the picture, stay through thecredits, and you will get to see the baby pictures of all of the stars.       Several of the characters were so obnoxious that every time theywere on the screen you wanted to stare at your feet.  The entire Dwyerfamily was in that category.  Marty Dwyer was played by Tom Arnold athis absolute worst, and Gail Dwyer was acted by Joan Cusack who gave amiserable performance.  The Dwyer children could be poster kids forPlanned Parenthood.  Finally, Jeff Goldblum, playing a relative of theDwyer's, was at best watchable.       In addition to the excellent acting of Williams, I thought Grantand Moore were both quite good and believable.  Everyone knows Grant'swork, but people may not be familiar with Moore's.  She was at her bestas Yelena in VANYA ON 42ND STREET - a don't miss movie in my book.       NINE MONTHS runs 1:43.  The scenes not involving the Dwyer familywere well paced.  All traces of the Dwyer family should have beenobliterated.  I give a mild thumbs up to NINE MONTHS nevertheless.  Thetwo lead characters plus Williams were worth going to see.  I award themovie ** 1/2. ",Nine Months,PG-13,1995,2
675,"Americans tend to think of the world in simple terms, and that includes even their nation's history. Third quarter of 20th Century is often seen as the conflict between two forces embodied by two very different US Presidents. The first one of them was John F. Kennedy - great statesman, courageous reformer and embodiment of youthful idealism that was supposed to bring USA into new Golden Age. Opposed to him was Richard M. Nixon - evil, corrupt, reactionary, genocidal and power-hungry paranoid that nearly destroyed American democray. While Kennedy's assassination proved to be one of greatest American tragedies, Nixon's disgraceful removal from the Oval office was one of great American triumphs. This perspective, implanted by 1960s and 1970s salon leftists into Hollywood and the rest of the world, was the reason why NIXON, 1995 biopic directed by Oliver Stone, represents one of the greatest surprises to come from Hollywood in the past decade.  The plot begins in June 1972, at the moment when the infamous ""Plumbers"" prepare for the Watergate break-in, and ends in August 1974, with the resignation of President Richard Nixon (played by Anthony Hopkins). The well-documented events that unfold in between are intertwined with Nixon remembering the events that marked both his life - traumatic childhood in 1920s California - and the history - Chequers speech, 1960 and 1968 elections, Vietnam War and his foreign policy triumphs.  Four years before this film Oliver Stone in JFK had accepted the traditional ""Kennedy-as-saint"" gospel, so most people expected Oliver Stone to make a hatchet job of 37th US President in NIXON. Others expected the film to be flooded with wild conspiracy theories. NIXON didn't meet such expectations. Oliver Stone instead gave surprisingly serious, three-dimensional and humane portrayal of disgraced American leader, obviously being fascinated with many contradictory and enigmatic details of his character and biography. While Stone doesn't shy away from showing what brought such infamy to Nixon, he also gives his human side and even some redeeming qualities - his patriotism, dedication to family and the potential for true greatness. But, just like the protagonists of classic tragedies, Nixon failed to meet such potential from his own human weakness. This powerful message, underlined with Stone's clever idea to turn White House into some sort of haunted Gothic castle, is however muddled with Stone succumbing to his old conspiracy theories and sensationalism in the most un-opportune moments. Idea that the same people who had killed Kennedy - the ""dark forces"" - played part in Nixon's downfall is intriguing; putting those forces in the form of Texas oilman played by Larry Hagman (who had played similar role in 1970s soap DALLAS) makes this idea into parody of itself.  Another problem with the film is casting. Anthony Hopkins tries his best to impersonate Nixon, but the Welsh actor under heavy make-up is simply hard to associate with the real-life president. Joan Allen as First Lady Pat Nixon, Paul Sorvino as Kissinger and Powers Boothe as Alexander Haig don't seem to have such problem (and the Boothe delivers truly chilling performance). Narrative structure of the film also makes things difficult for viewers - in the first hour the plot meanders between June 1972 and December 1973 and goes back to June 1972 only to catch the classic linear structure in last two hours. Movie also suffers because of Stone's desire to make it look ""cool"" by combining different film stock, using MTV-style editing and putting Chinese and Cyrillic characters in the scenes that feature Nixon's meetings with leaders of China and Soviet Union. Watergate scandal is, on the other hand, carefully recreated in all of its infamy, but those who want to find something more about it could do better if they watch television documentary.  At the very end of the film, when Hopkins' Nixon gets replaced with the documentary footage of 37th President, the audience would get impression that the real character was more intriguing and interesting than the one portrayed in the movie. Some day in the future the lessons from this film will serve the makers of CLINTON. ",Nixon,R,1995,2.5
676,"      NO ESCAPE is a non-stop action flick in the Steven Seagal genre.You get to witness lots and lots of people dying many differenthorrible deaths in front of your very eyes.  Especially popular areimpalements, but decapitations are also quite the rage.  Actually, Ilike some of these extreme action movies, but only if there is a fastpaced story behind it all as in DIE HARD or UNDER SIEGE and only if youcan care about the people.  NO ESCAPE had neither of these attributes.       NO ESCAPE is set in the year 2022 in an island prison run by anevil big business.  Can you imagine a Hollywood movie where a bigbusiness was not evil?  Oh well, I digress.  There are the badprisoners, called the outsiders, and the good prisoners, called theinsiders, on the island.  Ray Liotta, making an attempt at a good guyfor a change, is one of the insiders and hence gets to kill dozens anddozens of outsiders in various horrible ways.  The chief of theoutsiders is played by Stuart Wilson, and he is given dialog where heutters one joke after another.  The jokes manage rarely to be funnyhowever.  The script by Michael Gaylin, Joel Gross, and Richard Herleywas full of nonsense laced with failed attempts at humor.       The major failing of the movie is that of the director,MartinCampbell, and the script writers.  They have made characters that youdo not care if they live or die.  The movie consists of one battleafter another with many chases through the forest.  Maybe if they hadedited it down to 30 minutes, it would have worked as a ""Twilight Zone""episode, but 1 hour and 58 minutes was way too long.  It was done bythe same producer as ALIENS 3 which was a huge turkey after two greatALIENS episodes before #3.  ALIENS 3 also happens in an ugly prison inthe future that looks like the past.       The sets here were cute if a bit ridiculous.  Prisons in 2022 itturns out will look a lot like 13th century China complete withcostumes for warriors of that era.       My biggest disappointment was with Ray Liotta.  He played one ofthe scariest ex-cons ever in Jonathan Demme's Something Wild and hasbeen excellent in many other shows since, e. g. , GOODFELLAS andUNLAWFUL ENTRY.  In this movie, he is, well, boring.  His performancewas that of ROBOCOP but without ROBOCOP's humor. ",No Escape,R,1994,1

Their union is hardly match made in heaven because Pam happens to be seriously messed up - she uses drugs, drinks too much, suffers from occasional suicidal outbursts and, last but not least, spends too much. All this becomes unbearable for Chris, especially after he loses his job in police force. Despite Chris doing double shifts as security guard to make ends meet, Andersons are in the vicious circle of credit card debt and close to poverty. In despair, Chris finds simple but dangerous solution - he would use his intimate knowledge of police procedure to conduct series of perfect bank robberies. Plan works and Andersons start to get a slice of ""normal"" suburban life, but Pam then discovers the source of this new wealth and decides to accompany her husband during robberies, just for the thrill of it.   Just like in HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, McNaughton gives interesting portrayal of pathological characters. In that he receives great help from Luke Perry. In this film former BEVERLY HILLS 921000 star showed that he was something more than a pretty face and that he indeed could act. Chris Anderson is his most complex and convincing role so far. In it he displays whole variety of emotions and contradictions within the same character - man who takes the very same professional and methodical approach when it comes to enforcing and breaking the law; in the same time this mask of cold professionalism hides fatal vulnerability. Ashley Judd, on the other hand, wasn't that lucky with her character, since Pam Anderson looks more like a walking encyclopaedia of social pathology than someone that could attract seemingly down-to-Earth and no-nonsense character like Chris. McNaughton also spoils generally good impression of the film with ""cute"" filming techniques and distracting use of punk music. Notion that the materialistic culture of American suburbs contributed to Andersons' crime spree is briefly touched upon and never properly explored. However, despite its prosaic title and almost total obscurity, NORMAL LIFE is quite extraordinary film that shows how the most outrageous stories can spawn from the most banal real life circumstances. ",Normal Life,R,1996,2.5
678,"When Michael and Mark Polish wrote the script for""Northfork,"" they may have had no idea that their reach fortimeless, universal human values could be taken right out of thisweek's headlines.  As warring powers in the Middle East givethe Bush administration's road map for peace a try, the Israeligovernment is faced with the prospect of having to move Jewishsettlers in the West Bank and Gaza out of homes they'veoccupied perhaps for decades.  Given the religious fervor thatties many of these people to the land ""given to them"" by biblicalinjunction, they will inevitably be torn not only from their fourwalls but from their very identity as Orthodox Jews.      While religious zealotry does not impact on the people beingdisplaced from their homes in Michael Polish's ""Northfork,"" theynonetheless accept that inevitably from a group of black-suited,fedora-covered bureaucrats who look like refugees from ""TheMatrix,"" or they put up a fight to the death in their determinationto remain on their Montana land, the only homes they know. Like faceless bureaucrats everywhere, the funereal officialsoffer some money to compensate the displaced from theirrickety lodgings and feel good about what they are doingbecause their government plans to flood the land, dam thewater, and create power for the greater Montana community.     ""Northfolk,"" however, is only partly a cautionary note againstprogress, seen as leaps forward which are not achieved withoutconsiderable human cost.  In its grand theme about the natureof identity, the Polish brothers tackle not only the loss thatcomes to people when they are expelled from the land that theylove but even more important, our need to be a member of afamily that loves us, that does not abandon us either physicallyor psychologically.  In realizing that motif, the Polish brothersfocus on eight-year-old Irwin (Duel Farnes), an orphan who isdying and whose parents among those forced to move out ofthe village of Northfork, Montana return him to the man whohad taken care of him, Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) rather thanbecome inconvenienced by the need to look after the child.  Afevered Irwin, convinced that he is an angel who will be rescuedby others of his ilk, conjures up a cast of characters who are sostrange that people in the audience who believe in the literalimages of the afterlife will be more afraid of death than ever. How long can we really put up with people like the androgynousFlower Hercules (Daryl Hannah), who tells the boy that she isboth his father and his mother; Cup of Tea (Robin Sachs), whoserves the hot drink between his dry, cynical statements; andthe legally blind Happy (Anthony Edwards), whose limited sightis bolstered by a pair of glasses with six or seven lenses andconsiders himself a scientist in addition to being an angelwithout wings.       ""Northfork"" moves along its glacial pace in a non-linearfashion, telling two stories: one, which deals with the loss of theold vision of a landholding, agricultural America founded in 1776which gives way to the faceless, post-1955 industrial giant,features James Woods in the role of Walter O'Brien who withhis son Willis (writer Mark Polish) are one pair that make up TheEvacuation Committee.  Like modern-day salesmen eager tomake their quota to enjoy company-paid trips to Hawaii, eachpair needs to get sixty-five residents to sign waivers andabandon their homes and in return the company men will gettitle to a small plot of land.  The other story finds the unfortunateorphan substituting his dreams for his bleak reality, though he isfortunate in having the local religious leader care for him whilethe search goes on.     Heavy as this all sounds, ""Northfork"" is not without humor,albeit of the driest kind, some so corny as to be camp.  Whenone pair from the Evacuation Committee barges in on alovemaking couple, they warn, ""Stop screwing around.""  Seeinga ragged mat in front of one door, a bureaucrat explains,""They've worn out their welcome.""  The magic realism includesa church which is not much more than a roof with pews, thecongregation looking not at stained-glass windows but at themore appealing sight of the broad Montana landscape in theraw.       True to their nature, the Polish brothers give their film theIndie look with a capital ""I,"" desaturating the colors into tenshades of gray while lighting the angelic characters strongly totake the place of the more literal wings and haloes.  Like ""TwinFalls Idaho"" and ""Jackpot,"" both Polish films done in a matter ofdays rather than months or years, ""Northfork"" was knocked outon location in Montana in just twenty-four.  Original that this filmmay be, it does recall the angels looking down and commentingon Berlin in Wim Wenders's ""Der Himmel uber Berlin"" (""Wingsof Desire"") and is of a piece with the same deadpan humor anddesire for family connection in their ""Twin Falls, Idaho.""     As the old advisory goes, this is not for every taste.  If you thrillto ""Terminator 3"" and area agog at ""The Hulk,"" you'd probablypass this one buy.  If you're looking for the antidote to the usualsummer fare, this is your pic. ",Northfork,PG-13,2003,1.5
679,"The wonderfully good spirited and unabashedly raunchy high jinks in JoelGallen's NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE will have you laughing and counting.  As thejokes come fast and furiously, you'll be attempting to compile a mental listof all of the teen movies that the film parodies.  RISKY BUSINESS, THEBREAKFAST CLUB, SHE'S THE ONE, ALMOST FAMOUS, etc. -- the list goes on andon.  NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE feels like AMERICAN PIE 3, as produced by JerryBruckheimer (GONE IN 60 SECONDS) and directed by John Hughes (FERRISBUELLER'S DAY OFF).  Its working title was TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT CLUELESSROAD TRIPS WHEN I CAN'T HARDLY WAIT TO BE KISSED, which would of had troublefitting on a marquee. Opening with a hilarious female masturbation scene, the movie instantlyserves notice that it intends to be a comedy that earns its R rating and notone of those wink-wink, smarmy PG-13 sexual comedies that have becomepopular with studio marketing departments.  Although it sometimes goes toofar over the top in order to shock -- I could do without the explodingtoilet gag -- generally the movie is a real crowd-pleaser that hits itsmark, causing the audience to burst into loud spasms of laughter. The most unlikely couple at John Hughes High School, where the story is set,is Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh) and Jake Wyler (Chris Evans).  Janey, whosefather's beat-up pickup has DIRTPOOR on the plates, is the school'swildflower.  Jake, who has FILTHYRICH on the license of his expensive, redsports car, is the school's hotshot quarterback.  Or he was, until theaccident.  Oh, Jake wasn't hurt but...  Well, we'll let you enjoy that scenelifted from RUDY without giving away the sidesplitting result. Jake makes a bet with the new starting QB that he can turn any girl into aprom queen, even Janey.  With her nerdy glasses, ponytail and paintsplattered overalls, Janey might be considered hopeless.  Of course,underneath she really has a killer body and a dynamite smile.   The movie gets lots of mileage through sight gags that are used briefly.Areola (Cerina Vincent), for example, is a new exchange student who is afull-time practicing nudist.  You know those wacky Europeans.  Another time,Janey's younger brother Mitch (Cody McMains) and his two buddies are in theboy's locker room.  Hearing girls, they look up to see a sign that reads:""Vent to Girl's Locker Room: Maximum Capacity 2 Adolescent Boys.""  Itdoesn't take a rocket scientist to see where this scene is going.   The school's football team is known as the Wasps, which makes the takeoff onBRING IT ON extra funny.  Jaime Pressly (TOMCATS) plays Priscilla, thebitchy captain of the cheerleaders.  Her vocabulary is non-stop cheerific. The challenge is on.  Which films could you identify?  Drop me a line, butonly if your count is at least twenty; otherwise, you're not even trying.And don't write for hints. NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE runs 1:30.  It is rated R for ""strong crude sexualcontent and humor, language and some drug content"" and would be acceptablefor older teenagers.",Not Another Teen Movie,R,2001,2.5
680,"From the start, director Nick Cassavetes (2002's ""John Q"") makes nobones about what kind of motion picture ""The Notebook"" is, and whataudience it has been made for. A tearjerker about the undying powerof true love, the film injects practically every cliche of the genrein hopes that some of the devices„the unlikely rich girl/poor guyromance, disapproving parents, unreceived love letters, a disease„willstick. They do, despite a creaky plot that is about as predictableas they come, and many softies in the audience may very well findthemselves with a Kleenex in hand as the end credits start to roll.""The Notebook"" might be hopelessly maudlin fluff, but Cassavetes'assured filmmaking and some lovely performances help to raise it above mediocrity. At a tranquil nursing home, an elderly man (James Garner) spends hiswaking hours reading a love story written in a notebook to a woman(Gena Rowland) of the same age. She is intrigued by the story, eagerlyanticipating how it ends, but alas, she is suffering from Alzheimer'sDisease and doesn't realize that it is about her own life. Cue theextended 1940's flashbacks, as lowly ""country"" boy Noah (Ryan Gosling)woos beautiful ""city"" girl Allie (Rachel McAdams). At first unreceptiveto his advances, Allie soon falls in love with the earnest Noah. Unfortunately,following a wondrous summer together, they are split apart by Allie'sdisapproving mother (Joan Allen), who believes her daughter can dobetter. With Allie a thousand miles away at Sarah Lawrence Collegeand Noah shipped off to fight in World War II, the two seem destinedto make their way through life with nothing more than a fond memoryof the other. When a chance reunion occurs seven years later, Allieand Noah cann ot deny their continued feelings for one another. WillAllie settle for financial security with respectful fiance Lon Hammond(James Marsden), or follow her heart and choose what will make her happiest? Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, whose ""Message in a Bottle""was made into a drippy 1999 adaptation starring Kevin Costner andRobin Wright Penn, and whose ""A Walk to Remember"" was turned intoa likable 2002 adaptation starring Shane West and Mandy Moore, ""TheNotebook"" falls safely into the latter category. As far as big-screenweepers go, the movie fails to match the lofty heights of 1983's ""Termsof Endearment"" and 1988's ""Beaches,"" but it is comfortable, well-made,and kind of charming in its old-fashioned ways. There are no actionscenes, no apparent visual effects, and no marketable pop tunes. Whatis left, then, is a pleasantly simple and warm-hearted story abouttwo people who are total opposites, but perfect for each other. Much of the credit for making this plot work deservedly goes to RyanGosling (2004's ""The United States of Leland"") and Rachel McAdams(2004's ""Mean Girls""), a perfectly engaging pair as the young Noahand Allie who share ample chemistry, both with the camera and witheach other. For Gosling, who has memorably played a lot of mentallyunhinged characters in the past, and for McAdams, who has been stuckin stereotypical teen parts, this is an ideal entrance into starringroles. Both are up to the challenge of portraying romantic leads theviewer wants to see get together, and it helps all the more that theyexhibit quite hefty acting chops that should propel them further in their careers. James Garner (2002's ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"") andGena Rowlands (2004's ""Taking Lives"") are sufficiently poignant astheir older counterparts. Their personal story, which is more or lessa wraparound for the flashbacks, doesn't afford them as much screentime, but Garner and Rowlands are up to the challenge in displayingthe deep love they share for one another, even as Allie is in thelater stages of Alzheimer's and must struggle to remember her past.The film's sappy final scene could have become unbearably laughablein lesser hands, but director Cassavetes and his actors use a subtleapproach in making it work. In supporting roles, Joan Allen (1998's ""Pleasantville"") shades Allie'sstern mother with some unexpected dimensions in a quietly effectivelate scene, while James Marsden (2003's ""X2"") has the thankless, unenviabletask of playing the expendable third wheel in the Allie-Noah-Lon lovetriangle. At the very least, at least Lon is written as a nice enoughguy so that Allie's ultimate choice doesn't seem so easy. With lush cinematography by Robert Fraisse (1998's ""Ronin""), takingadvantage of its southern setting's serene lakes and beautiful, color-strewnsunsets, ""The Notebook"" resembles a romance novel come to cinematiclife (which is what it is). The film doesn't transcend its well-worngenre, but it is far from the worst of its type and has an unhurried,compassionate allure. At its center are the invaluable Ryan Goslingand Rachel McAdams, who invite viewers to bask in their star-crossedromance and get them to care about the easily foreseen outcome. Real-lifelove stories rarely work out quite so faultlessly, but for two hoursit's nice to believe that they could. ","Notebook, The",PG-13,2004,2.5

683,"Gosh, aren't fart jokes funny?  And if you've blown upwards of fifty bucksto take your family to the movies, you'll certainly want lots of them foryour entertainment dollar.  How about flatulence so intense that itliterally sets a restaurant on fire?  Now, that would really be funny.Right? Well, so apparently believes the studio which spent over seventy milliondollars coming up with the sequel to THE NUTTY PROFESSOR starring EddieMurphy.  This time called NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS, the movie againstars a trash-talking Eddie Murphy, playing a host of roles.  The onlycommendable part of the production is the amazing make-up effects that allowMurphy to look like a wide variety of obese characters. The writing credits for this abomination are shared by no less than 5writers: Steve Oedekerk, Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield, Paul Weitz andChris Weitz.  I'd recommend that they all hide their heads in shame.  Themovie will probably make a bundle, but, surely, they could have come up withmore imaginative material than this smelly batch of recycled bathroom humor.They even stoop to having an octogenarian mistakenly eat a large piece offeces. This ""R"" movie, which is incorrectly rated PG-13, is actually written withdumbed-down humor that seems designed to appeal to 8-year-old boys' crudesensibilities.  But, the movie would certainly not be appropriate for anyoneyounger than their teenage years. Among other offensive scenes are those ofkiller turds and an animal having anal sex with a human. Moreover, crudeness does not equal funny, as the renowned Farrelly brothers(THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) demonstrated recently in ME, MYSELF & IRENE,a much better film than NUTTY PROFESSOR II.  At least the MPAA correctlyrated ME, MYSELF & IRENE as an R.  Both films share about the same level ofcoarseness in their brand of attempted humor. When not dispensing one disgusting joke after another, the movie follows aplot that has Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) trying to rid himself of hisnefarious alter ego, Buddy Love (Murphy).  There are plenty of subplotsinvolving the rest of the fat Klump clan.  Typical of these is an unfunnybedroom scene between Papa Klump (Murphy) and Mama Klump (Murphy).  ""Viagradoesn't work for me,"" he tells her, spurning her advances.  ""I've beentaking them like M&Ms."" I tried hard to think of good things about the movie other than the make-up.All I can come up with is that Janet Jackson, as the professor's girlfriend,does have a particularly inviting smile.  (Another would be that Murphymumbles half of his lines, which partially spares us from some of the film'sinanities.)  That's it.  If you're still dead set on wasting your money onthis film, don't say I didn't warn you. NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS runs a long 1:50.  It is officially ratedPG-13 for ""crude humor and sex-related material.""  Consider it an R.

684,"How does one account for the exquisitely detailed and thought-provoking""Spider-Man 2"" being every bit as masterful as its hugely successfulpredecessor, 2002's ""Spider-Man,"" particularly when almost every othercomic book adaptation ever made (i.e. the ""Batman"" series, 2000's""X-Men"" and 2003's ""X2,"" 2003's ""Daredevil,"" 2004's ""The Punisher"")has paled in comparison? Two words: Sam Raimi. A passionate fan ofthe Marvel comic, director Raimi, it seems, has been strengtheninghis skills for twenty years in preparation for these movies. Oncethe filmmaker behind 1983's cult horror film ""The Evil Dead"" and itstwo sequels, and also responsible for such ch aracter pieces as 1998's""A Simple Plan"" and 2000's ""The Gift,"" Raimi has taken the raw emotionsof the former pictures and the character and storytelling depth ofthe latter to create two of the greatest superhero movies in history.""Spider-Man 2"" does not improve upon the classic original, but itis most certainly an equal, lacking the first film's chilling villain„theGreen Goblin„but making up for this minor deficiency with added complexity,raised stakes, and a tighter story arc. Two years after Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) killed the villainousNorman Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), and accepted hiscrime-fighting abilities, he is still having trouble juggling hisnormal life and the secret one that must be hidden from his familyand friends. A bright student at Columbia University, Peter's schoolwork and side jobs as a photographer and pizza delivery man have begunto suffer due to his taxing responsibilities as Spider-Man. His bestfriend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), now the head of illustrious sciencefacility OsCorp, remains determined to avenge his father's death andkill Spider-Man. Meanwhile, true love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)has grown fed up with Peter's unreliable, noncommittal ways and agreedto marry the handsome John Jameson (Daniel Gillies). Just as Peterdecides to retire the spider costume in an attempt to win back MaryJane, he is faced with a new, extremely dangerous adversary whom hecan't back down from: Dr. Otto Octavius, a.k.a. Doc Ock (Alfred Molina),a brilliant scientist-turned-machine equipped with four giant metal tentacles. By their very nature, sequels are usually not as fresh and culminatemore out of a financial decision than a creative one. ""Spider-Man2"" bucks the trend, smoothly and intriguingly continuing its plotprogression where the last film left off. Even more vital is directorSam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargent's (2002's ""Unfaithful"") adepthandling of the characters, who are not one-dimensional figures bombardedby special effects, but continue to grow and develop as real peopledo. The visual effects, which are amazing artistic feats and nearlyseamless, are wisely used to support the story, rather than the otherway around. In choosing this path, the characters of Peter, Mary Jane,Harry, and Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris) avoid becoming mere pawnsto the action and withhold the narrative on their own. Despite beingwithin the realms of a fantasy, they are lovingly written, living-and-breathingpeople w hose problems are universal. Conflicts concerning self-identity,sacrifice, secrets, regret, and love are dealt with the utmost seriousnessand truth; so poignant is the film at times, and so observant andtangible are the human figures that ""Spider-Man 2"" could just as effectivelystand as a straight character drama as it does a fantasy-action movie. ""Spider-Man 2"" is a big-budget, mainstream popcorn movie, however,and audiences will be hard-pressed to find a more exciting, intelligent,and ultimately satisfying one all summer. The action sequences, spreadevenly throughout the film at roughly 20-minute intervals, delivereverything the first film's did while making them more extravagantand awe-inspiring. Standing out is one battle sequence set on theside of a building, as Spider-Man attempts to rescue Aunt May fromDoc Ock, while the unadulterated visceral highlight is a set-pieceset on a runaway train between Spider-Man and Doc Ock that is unrelentingin its sheer goal to have you on the edge of your seat and purelydelighted. The culmination of this scene is unexpected and inspiring,laying the way for a climax of monumental discoveries and plot developmentsthat prove nothing will ever be the same again for these characters. The returning actors, by now comfortable in their respective roles,work as a flawless unit; they are so ideally cast in their parts thatif one of them were to disappear, the whole enterprise might topple.Tobey Maguire (2003's ""Seabiscuit""), at one time looked upon withskepticism when he was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, has turnedout to be so right for the role that no one else could possibly takehis place. Maguire has that everybody charm about him that makes Peterinstantly root-worthy, but he is also physically up to the challengewhile capable of dealing with the film's darker emotions. KirstenDunst (2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"") remains a transfixing Mary Jane Watson,an aspiring actress who strongly believes in the love and connectionshe shares with Peter, and suspicious of why he refuses to let herget close to him. Mary Ja ne is not simply the love interest, buta fully dimensional character on her own, and Dunst manages to garnersympathy and emotional power with her every facial expression. AsHarry Osborn, James Franco (2002's ""City by the Sea"") does well ineliciting his care for Peter even as his hatred for Spider-Man intensifies.And the warmly believable Rosemary Harris (2000's ""The Gift"") handlesher several dramatic moments and speeches with palpable pathos. Theweak link, and major addition to the cast, is Alfred Molina (2003's""Identity""), who is effective in his early scenes as the kind andambitious Dr. Otto Octavius, but is miscast when he must become threateningas Doc Ock. Try as he might, Molina is no match for Willem Dafoe.Fortunately, he is given four particularly evil tentacles that manage to do much of the menacing. With the end of ""Spider-Man 2"" comes the undeniable feeling that,for all of these characters, there is no turning back in their individualjourneys. Not once does the top-notch, mature screenplay appear tobe spinning its wheels. As Peter decides that being Spider-Man ishis life's destiny, Harry Osborn moves one step closer to fillinghis late father's crooked shoes. And as for Mary Jane, she makes alife-altering sacrifice that will be fascinating to see how it ishandled in the next installment. ""Spider-Man 2"" is a visually dazzlingspectacle and a technically creative triumph„the music score by DannyElfman and clever opening credits sequence are superlative„but wherethe motion picture contains its greatness is in director Sam Raimi'smultilayered and realistic treatment of the characters and their afflictions.By deeply caring about Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson and the restof the ensemble, the film transcends its comic book roots and takeson a life of its own. In no way, shape, or form is ""Spider-Man 2""a typically silly superhero movie; this is a significant and grandlyentertaining cinematic work.",O,R,2001,2.5

Who else would approach Homer's classic""Odyssey"" with a Preston Sturges touch? Yet there is is, up on thescreen, a road movie beginning with a blind prophet.

The title comes from the oft-mentioned film in PrestonSturges' ""Sullivan's Travels."" To spice up the episodic structure andstolid pacing, there's T-Bone Burnett's tuneful bluegrass music, asthe trio joins up with a black guitarist (Chris Thomas King), who soldhis soul to the Devil, to cut a hit record as ""The Soggy Bottom Boys.""While Roger Deakins' photography is visually stylish, there's afundamental problem: a complete lack of humor.

When on October 4, 1957, theRussians launched Sputnik, heralding the dawn of the Space Age, itinspired Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) to look to the stars rather thaninto a bleak future in the coal mines. Working with three high schoolfriends, and inspired by rocket pioneer Dr. Werner Von Braun, Hickambegins to design and launch a series of rockets at his own ""CapeCoalwood,"" a slag heap - much to the disgust and dismay of his father(Chris Cooper), the mine superintendent. Only his teacher (Laura Dern)supports him, supplying a book on rocketry and encouraging him tolearn trigonometry to gauge the range of the shots. Everywhere, HomerHickam looks there are seemingly insurmountable obstacles blocking himfrom his goals of becoming a rocket scientist, yet earning hisfather's acceptance and approval. Nevertheless, he doggedly pursueshis soaring dream which, eventually, becomes a fulfillment of thehopes of the close-knit, rural town.

Which is notsurprising since it's written and directed by Mike Judge, the creatorof ""Beavis and Butthead"" and ""King of the Hill."" Ron Livingston playsa young computer programmer who hates everything about his geeky,anonymous job at Initech Corp. - the mind-numbing routine, theclock-punching, the procedure-obsessed supervisors, the ""paper jams""and the pettiness. Above all, however, he hates the humiliation ofbeing fired as the result of downsizing. To ease his frustration, hisyuppie girl-friend arranges for him to see ""an occupationalhypnotherapist"" who suffers a fatal heart attack in the midst of histherapy session, leaving Livingston relaxed and free of all hisanxieties about unemployment. Unencumbered, he begins to enjoy life,much to the consternation of his despicable, condescending boss (GaryCole) who is prone to tell his employees on Friday afternoon thatthey're expected to report for work on Saturday and Sunday. ""I don'tlike my job,"" Livingston says nonchalantly, ""and I'm not going to go.""Then, when he's interviewed by a couple of consultants, his candid,carefree sarcasm about his uselessness is interpreted as aqualification for an upper-management position.

688,"With one of the most eclectic and fun casts of the new year and areturn of sorts for director Todd Phillips to the campus comedy genre(after 2000's ""Road Trip""), unsuspecting viewers walking into ""OldSchool"" may question how it could possibly fail. 90 minutes later,they will have woefully received their answer. Virtually exempt ofany sort of plot and seemingly edited together with a chainsaw, thefilm is a startling mess, almost as unfunny as it is unoriginal. Upon returning home from a business trip, 30-year-old Mitch Martin(Luke Wilson) discovers his beloved girlfriend, Heidi (Juliette Lewis),in the midst of a multiple-partner Internet hookup. Without a placeto stay, he rents out a house on the fringes of Harrison University.When the Dean of the school (Jeremy Piven), an old, much-bullied classmateof his, finds out about his new living situation, Mitch is threatenedto lose the house since he isn't a campus resident. Egged on by hisfrustrated, married buddies Frank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (VinceVaughn), who are looking to relive their fun-filled college days,Mitch starts his own fraternity that not only becomes the talk ofthe university, but makes him a star. Hijinks ensue. Written by Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong, ""Old School"" is a badmovie, plain and simple. Scene after scene is strung together by thebarest of cohesive narratives, to the point where you are never evensure which act the movie is on. Meanwhile, the three central charactersof Mitch, Frank, and Beanie have a certain potential to be interesting,but their development remains nonexistent, save for one or two keycharacteristics. Mitch is the nice guy. Frank is the recently marriedone with a low tolerance for alcohol or settling down. And Beanieis the hen-pecked husband and father who misses his past sexual escapades.When the movie ends, it simply cuts to the credits, without any ofthe characters having changed, or learned anything, and the storystill waiting in the wings to even be introduced.  In all fairness, low-brow comedies do not need to be meaningful oreven all that involving, just as long as they are funny and cleverenough to carry you through a 90-minute running time. In the caseof ""Old School,"" the jokes are strictly of the worn out variety, notraunchy enough to be shocking and not imaginative enough to even elicitmild admiration. The sole comedic standout, in which a hilarious AndyDick (2000's ""Loser"") plays a stereotypical gay sex tutor who instructsa group of women on how to give a blow job, has still been done manytimes before. The rest, such as a KY Jelly-infused pen fight and atranquilizer gun that accidentally goes off into Frank's neck, are disposable. As Mitch, Luke Wilson (2001's ""Legally Blonde"") has got the sweet,good guy role down pat, but remains unchallenged. Vince Vaughn (2001's""Domestic Disturbance"") is wasted as Beanie. Will Ferrell (2001's""Zoolander"") is the real star of the picture if there is one. As partyanimal Frank, not only is Ferrell completely uninhibited as an actor(he plays several scenes full-frontal), but he can make anything--evenlow-rent material such as this--at least somewhat enjoyable. EllenPompeo, who made such a splash in 2002's ""Moonlight Mile,"" nicelyplays Mitch's love interest, Nicole, but their relationship is underwritten.The rest of the talented cast, including Juliette Lewis (2002's ""Enough""),Leah Remini (TV's ""The King of Queens""), and Elisha Cuthbert (TV's""24""), show real potential with their characters, but it is wasted and utterly squandered. How director Todd Phillips, who showed such promise with ""Road Trip""three years ago, has taken such giant steps back as a filmmaker canonly be attributed to a remarkably flawed and unfocused screenplaythat was put into production long before it was filmable. Neitherfunny nor likable nor charming nor particularly entertaining, ""OldSchool"" is a big-screen comedic bust that flunks out in every department.",Old School,R,2003,2
689,"      ""Now and then, for no good reason, life will haul off and knock aman flat,"" the father consoles his son.  The 1957 Disney movie OLDYELLER is like that.  For most of the film, it is a light hearted sliceof life with scenes reminiscent of the old Disney nature documentaries.Toward the end, the movie takes a sharp turn, transforming it into atragedy.  It is this concluding portion that wins the show's deservedreputation as one of Disney's better live action films.       Set in a post-Confederate Texas, the people are all dirt poor, buthappy and resourceful.  The Coates family consists of a father Jim(Fess Parker), mother Katie (Dorothy McGuire), older son Travis (TommyKirk), and younger son Arliss (Kevin Corcoran).  The Coates are so poorthat the children have never seen a dollar bill, except a Confederateone and ""it ain't worth nothin'.""  The father spends almost all themovie gone on a cattle drive where he hopes to earn money to supporthis family.       Most of the acting in the film has the depth of a TV movie, butthe simple script by William Tunberg, based on the novel by FredGipson, takes a pleasant little tale and turns it into a moving storythrough the gripping conclusion.  The acting by Tommy Kirk, as the boywho has to become a man overnight, is quite good and his charactereasily earns the audience's empathy.       The story concerns an ""old yeller dog"" that comes uninvited tostay with the family.  At first, Travis tries without success to shooit off, but Old Yeller eventually gains his respect and his love.       Most of the show is little more that a charming series of animalincidents.  We have bucking horses, raiding raccoons, hiding snakes,brawling bears, attacking hogs, and charging mother cows.  Old Yellermanages to be a hero in most of these episodes causing the mother toexclaim, ""If that don't beat all.  I never saw such a dog.""       Director Robert Stevenson understands how lightweight the firstpart is and never tries to make it seem more important that it is.  Hissaves the energy and emphasis for the last act.       The cinematography by Charles P. Boyle produces the most preciousscene of the show.  When Old Yeller's real owner, Burn Sanderson,played with genuine warmth by Chuck Connors, shows up to claim hisanimal, Arliss tries to bargain with him.  Boyle photographs Sandersonfrom way down at Arliss's level then switches to Sanderson's viewlooking straight down on little Arliss.  A great reminder of how adultstower over kids in both height and authority.       Toward the end, Old Yeller gets in serious danger twice.  Both ofthese have real potential to frighten younger viewers, but withoutthese parts, the film would have been little more than a nicediversion.  With them, the dog's value and bravery become absolutelyclear, and Travis has to face the harshness of his existence.  I willresist the urge to tell you more.       In a show full of homilies, the father's advice at the end isperhaps the best.  He tells his son, ""If you go looking for somethinggood to take the place of the bad, generally you can do it.""       OLD YELLER runs merely 1:23.  It is not rated, but would be a G.There is no sex, nudity, or bad language of any kind.  Animals do getattacked, and one boy gets a bloody leg, but there is no human to humanviolence.  ""I loved it!"" said my son Jeffrey, age 7 1/2.  ""I think boththe dogs were really good actors.""  He gave the show a thumbs up andrecommends the picture to kids 5 and up.  I totally agree and award thefilm ***. ",Old Yeller,G,1957,3
690,"One Night Stand began life as another Joe Eszterhas sex romp, but afterLeaving Las Vegas's Mike Figgis came on board to direct and extensivelyrewrite the script, Eszterhas amicably relinquished all writing credit.Figgis's resulting film is perhaps more serious-minded than Eszterhasoriginally intended, but after a promising start, this look at adulteryloses its way--and, in the end, anything resembling a point. The film begins rather oddly, with Max Carlyle (Wesley Snipes, who won theBest Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his fine performance) emergingfrom a New York hotel and introducing himself directly to the camera.  Heis a successful Los Angeles commercial director, with a large house, abeautiful wife named Mimi (Ming-Na Wen), and two young children.  Max'sfamily does not accompany him on this trip, which he makes partly forbusiness but mostly to reconnect with his former best friend, gay,AIDS-stricken performance artist Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.). Unexpected chaos and confusion (involving a hotel clerk played by Figgishimself, hiding his moptop under a bad Elvis-like wig) prompt Max to stayin New York for an extra night, and by chance he meets Karen (NastassjaKinski), a mysterious blonde who is also married.  The traumaticcircumstances that lead to the titular adulterous encounter are mechanical,but, under the director's capable hand, they are quite believable, and whenthe two do fall into bed, it is depicted in a non-exploitative (and verynon-Eszterhas) fashion: brief glimpses, sensuously scored by Figgishimself, punctuated by fadeouts (the latter a visual flourish Figgis comesto overuse as the film progresses). The next day Max returns home to L.A. feeling removed from his life, andthis is where the film starts running into some trouble.  While the reasonsbehind his feelings of detachment are completely understandable, thosebehind the strain between Max and Mimi are not.  Certainly the one nightwould cause some marital turbulence, but it is implied that their marriagealready had some underlying problems, a point which is poorly established(the only detectable problem is Mimi's aggressiveness in the bedroom).More strain comes a year later, when Max, this time with Mimi in tow,returns to the Big Apple to visit the now-bedridden Charlie, andreencounters Karen, who, as it turns out, is married to Charlie's brotherVernon (Kyle MacLachlan). With his discreet handling of the one night, Figgis successfullyestablishes that the Max and Karen's initial encounter is not about a cheapthrill.  But it is also meant to show a passionate spiritual connectionbeing made between Max and Karen, which I could not grasp; instead I simplysaw two people clinging to each other in a moment of weakness--no more, noless.  So when the reunited Max and Karen try hard to not give in to theirfeelings, one wonders exactly what those feelings are.  Lust?  No; theirnight together is shown as more than a cheap thrill.  Love?  That seems tobe the intent, but one never gets a clear idea of it, especially since weget no real insight into what Karen feels the whole time, and Kinski addsno dimension to her flatly written role.  In fact, the only characters thatare not written with any depth are Max and Charlie (marvelously played byDowney), who, not surprisingly, serves as the voice of reason. Figgis told Entertainment Weekly that he does not think that any of theoriginal Eszterhas script remains in the film, but one would never guessbased on the pair of twists that cap the film.  Lacking in any concretebuildup, subtle or overt, these developments seem to come straight out ofEszerhas's manipulative bag of tricks.  As problematic as I found One NightStand to be for much of its running time, at the very least it appeared tobe setting up a point.  But by the time the conclusion rolls around, youwonder if Figgis ever really had one. ",One Night Stand,R,1997,1.5
691,"Harald Zwart's ""One Night at McCool's"" attracted an impressive roster of talent, particularly considering how one-note and needlessly nihilistic it is. Acquiring the storytelling method of Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon,"" in which one story is told by three separate people, based on each of their individual point-of-views, the movie is all technique and zero substance. Meandering from one scene to the next without any clear-cut destination, the entire affair feels simply tired, and far too violent and mean. Did I mention it wants to be a comedy?  In one night, three lonely men's lives are changed by the appearance of one sultry, dangerously beautiful woman named Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler). Told mostly in flashbacks by the three whipped guys--dense bartender Randy (Matt Dillon), married lawyer Carl (Paul Reiser), and widowed Detective Dehling (John Goodman)--the film makes great pains in showing how each of them were instantly smitten with Jewel, a possible femme fatale with ulterior motives hiding just underneath her various laced bras and low-cut dresses.  Closing up the bar for the night, Randy spots an argument in the parking lot and saves Jewel from the clutches of her abusive boyfriend Utah (Andrew Silverstein, formerly Andrew Dice Clay). After going home with Randy and having wild sex, the guilt-ridden Jewel admits that she actually has feelings for him, but that the whole thing was a set-up in order for she and Utah to rob him. It's not long before Jewel murders Utah and quickly moves in with Randy, dead-set on designing the dream home she has always longed for, complete with window treatments and an entertainment center. On the case of Utah's suspicious demise, Detective Dehling takes one look at Jewel and falls head over heels for her himself, convinced that Randy is a ""beater"" and Jewel an innocent housewife. And Randy's cousin, Carl, who believes he is God's gift to all women, also sets out to start an S&M-littered affair with Jewel. All she seems to really want, though, is a DVD player to go along with her big-screen television set.  ""One Night at McCool's"" is offbeat, to be sure, but not much else. Flimsily plotted and with paper-thin characters who have no real cares or interests outside of Jewel, this film noir black-comedy goes nowhere, and stays there for its 93-minute running time that feels more akin to a lifetime. Nowhere in this movie can there be found a likable or identifiable person, or a situation that even bears a slight resemblance to real life.  In a role that is mostly notable for ogling her breasts at the camera, Liv Tyler (2000's ""Dr. T and the Women"") manages to survive mostly unscathed. Jewel may be just as one-dimensional as everyone else, but Tyler does what she can, giving her several different character shades that makes you question at all times just who this person is. The fine actress doesn't take herself too seriously here, and she is the sole reason why one particular moment works perfectly, with Jewel trashily washing a very dirty car and getting all soaped-up and bothered. If my memory serves me correctly, Tyler garners the only intermittent laughs that come from the shallow screenplay by Stan Seidel.  Playing second fiddle to Tyler, Matt Dillon (1998's ""Wild Things""), Paul Reiser (1995's ""Bye Bye, Love""), and John Goodman (2000's ""What Planet Are You From?"") are giant bores with characters who are uninteresting, at best. This is especially surprising subpar work for the usually very good Goodman. In what may be the most strangest big-star pop-up of the year, Michael Douglas (so brilliant in 2000's ""Traffic"" and ""Wonder Boys"") plays a cheesy hit man with a mullet hairdo and not many other distinguishing factors. Douglas produced this misfire, though, so at least there is some evidence of why he chose to appear.  The climactic shoot-em'-up, scored to The Village People's ""YMCA,"" puts the final nail in ""One Night at McCool's"" coffin. By the time the end credits roll, only two of the main characters are left standing, and neither one has evoked an ounce of our sympathy. It does, however, leave a terribly sour taste in your mouth--a cardinal sin when you're dealing with what is supposed to be a funny, comedic romp. ",One Night at McCool's,R,2001,2

693,"        With all that has been written about the feminist movement, ittook Pulitzer Prize-winning Anna Quindlen to write an engrossing storythat dramatizes the complex difference between our mother's generationand us, a confrontation between a woman whose expectations neverextended beyond her home and her children and her husband's career,who viewed her life as an adjunct to those things, and her daughter,whom she raised not only to work but to expect the world. ReneeZellweger (""Jerry Maguire"") plays an ambitious Manhattan journalistwho is forced to move back home to help her middle-aged parents -Meryl Streep and William Hurt - through a cancer crisis. Not only doesshe discover who her parents really are - their strengths, theirweaknesses - but the gutsy, gritty emotional journey she undertakes asa care-giver is a complicated rite-of-passage to her ownmaturity. Superbly adapted for the screen by Karen Croner and directedby Carl Franklin (""Devil in a Blue Dress""), the performances aredazzling, except for Tom E.

694,"In whole, January is a miserable month for movies each year, savefor a single truly great release. 1999 had Neil Jordan's haunting,underrated ""In Dreams."" 2000 had the lesser, but still well-done ""Eyeof the Beholder."" 2001 had Sean Penn's chilling, thought-provoking""The Pledge."" And 2002 has ""Orange County,"" a marvelous--and marvelouslyfunny--entertainment that goes down as easily as a cold glass of wateron a balmy summer afternoon.  Energetically directed by Jake Kasdan (1998's ""Zero Effect""), the26-year-old son of veteran filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan (1983's ""TheBig Chill""), ""Orange County"" has advertised itself as a typical ""teen""comedy when it is anything but. With universal themes far more penetratingthat who will take who to the prom, or who will win the bet on turningthe ugly duckling into Miss Popularity, the film remains a down-to-earthexperience even amid some of the outlandish humor.  Attributing more in common with 1999's biting ""Election"" than 1999'scliched ""She's All That,"" ""Orange County"" also stands as a rare achievement--amainstream motion picture about high schoolers that transcends allof the usual age barriers of the genre. Literally anyone over theage of around 12 will be able to thoroughly enjoy it without feelingexcluded from the target audience. The hero of the story is Shaun Brumder (Colin Hanks), an Orange County,Ca., native who, as a high school senior, is preparing to go awayto college in the fall. Following the discovery of a life-changingnovel entitled ""Strait Jacket"" half-buried in the sand on a beach,Shaun is inspired to become a writer, and wants nothing more thanto be accepted to Stanford University, where the aforementioned book'sauthor, Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline), teaches as an English professor.Despite having exemplary grades and test scores, Shaun is distressedwhen he is denied admittance into the school, only to find that thedaffy high school guidance counselor (Lily Tomlin) accidentally sentthem the wrong transcript. With his loyal, animal-loving girlfriendAshley (Schuyler Fisk) and deliriously drugged-out older brother Lance(Jack Black) in tow, Shaun sets off for the university, determinedto straighten the whole mess out. Reading the premise, it would be easy to dismiss ""Orange County"" asanother ""Road Trip,"" but it is in the pitch-perfect treatment of thematerial that the film really hits a home run. In fact, it becomesincreasingly apparent that the plot is only an excuse to tell a heartfelt,joyful tale about acceptance, family, and the true important thingsin one's life. This is the key to the picture's remarkable success:so-called ""teen"" movies usually create characters as an excuse tofurther the story along, whereas ""Orange County"" uses the story asan excuse to present a wide range of exact, loving, and original characters. Standing front-and-center as Shaun Brumder is Colin Hanks (2001's""Get Over It""), son of Tom Hanks, in his first starring vehicle. Hankshas not had the right material in the past to prove that he had whatit took to be a leading man, but he more than fills his end of thebargain with a likably offbeat and sweet performance that consistentlycarries the movie from beginning to end.  The best thing about Shaun is his sheer goodness. He could stand asa positive role model for many teenagers, as the thing he is mostconcerned about in his life is not the school dance, but getting thebest education possible. The relationship Shaun shares with his highlydysfunctional family, including brother Lance, alcoholic mother Cindy(Catherine O'Hara), and old, wheelchair-bound stepfather Bob (GeorgeMurdock), is accurately and affectionately portrayed, not to mentionalternately hilarious and poignant.  Opposite Hanks is the sunny Schuyler Fisk (2000's ""Snow Day""), asShaun's main squeeze Ashley, who has the same sort of charm and sparkleas real-life mother Sissy Spacek. Ashley is strongly written to bemore than just the main character's love interest, as she stands bythe guy she cares about, because she cares about him, even as sherealizes him getting into Stanford will mean them having to break up.  As for Jack Black (2001's ""Shallow Hal""), as Shaun's eternally highbrother Lance, he turns in the type of incendiary comic turn thatstars are made of. Black is a fearless actor who will do anythingand everything for a laugh, and he earns every one of them twofold.  The rest of the cast is filled from one end to the other with well-knownactors in sharply realized supporting roles and cameos. It is a delightto simply see all of these familiar faces, and even more enjoyableknowing that they are mostly more than just throwaway parts. CatherineO'Hara (1998's ""Home Fries"") is a standout as Shaun's seriously unhingedmother, a generally good woman who, nonetheless, cannot bear to seeher son go away to college and leave her. Kevin Kline (2001's ""Lifeas a House""), as Shaun's novelist idol Marcus Skinner, is excellentfor his five minutes of screen time. A climactic scene in which, muchto his disbelief, Shaun comes face to face with Marcus, is honestlyhandled and surprisingly effective. Harold Ramis (1984's ""Ghostbusters"")is hilarious as Stanford's Dean of Admissions who accidentally accidentallymistakens Lance's tablets of ecstasy for advil. Lily Tomlin (2000's""The Kid""), Chevy Chase (2000's ""Snow Day""), Monica Keena (2000's""Crime and Punishment in Suburbia""), Garry Marshall (1999's ""NeverBeen Kissed""), and Ben Stiller (2001's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") alsohave memorable appearances. The screenplay, by Mike White (2000's ""Chuck & Buck""), refuses todissolve into formula with every turn it takes, making ""Orange County""not only an unusually intelligent and awfully funny movie, but alsoa genuinely fresh one with snappy dialogue and lovable characters.Light-hearted as it is, there are serious issues at work throughout,and its treatment of a troubled family that can't help but love oneanother is far more incisive here than it was in 2001's ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""  Finally, the way in which Shaun achieves at the end what he set outto do, and then makes a decision that goes against his original hopesand dreams, signals major growth on his part, and is carried out witha subtle hand. At 82 minutes, ""Orange County"" flies right by withthe blink of an eye--not because it is necessarily too short (eventhough it is on the brisk side), but because you are having so muchfun that you don't want it to end.",Orange County,R,2002,2.5
695,"Trey Parker is a very talented filmmaker. ORGAZMO wasmade cheaply, and it shows. But even without a lot of money, Parker puttogether a solid comedy with great writing, good directing, andsurprisingly good acting all around.   Joe Young (Parker) is a Mormon, going door-to-door for converts in L.A.Joe knocks on the door of Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), a porndirector who gets so angry at the interruption that he sends his thugsout to beat up the visitor. But Joe knows some moves and singlehandedlybeats Maxxx's thugs. Maxxx is so impressed he asks Joe to act in hisnext movie.   Joe learns what kind of movie Maxxx was talking about and starts to turnhim down, but the money is too good to pass up - by taking the part, Joewould have enough money to marry his sweetheart in the temple in SaltLake City. When Maxxx suggests that a stuntman can do all the dirty workso Joe can remain a virgin, Joe's moral objections dry up. Joe becomesORGAZMO, the pornographic superhero whose secret weapon is the""orgazmorator.""   Joe's co-star Ben, aka ""Choda Boy"" (Dian Bachar), has two PhDs from MIT,but enjoys working as a porn star. When he's not at work, he's inventingthings in his basement. One of his inventions is the orgazmorator, justlike in the porn films, but this one really works. Joe and Ben's livesstart to parallel Orgazmo and Choda Boy's as the two team up to fightcrime.   Orgazmo is a very funny film. I haven't laughed so hard at a moviesince... well... THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Granted, that's not verylong ago, but you get the point.   Part of the reason is the sheer silliness of the movie. There are tonsof cheap jokes, and most of them work beautifully - credit Parker asdirector, writer, and co-editor for that. Most of the jokes are visual(like Choda Boy's costumes or Young's reaction to the industry's commonpractices). But in addition there are some solidly funny ideas.   For example, if Joe just SAID he was a Mormon, it would be a single,funny joke: ha-ha, move on to the next one. But Joe really is a Mormon(or at least the comic equivalent). His constant naivete and sinceritymake the whole CHARACTER funny, all the way through the film. The factthat he never compromises his own morality gives the movie internalconsistency and makes the whole of the movie seem even funnier.   And there are some surprisingly good performances, especiallyconsidering that this is a cheap, rookie movie (it is Parker's second asdirector).   Parker makes the perfect comic hero. He conveys shock, wholesomeness,and chivalry with great exaggeration, but without carrying theperformance into sarcasm and cynicism.   Bachar is wonderful as Choda Boy, the movie's straight man (no punintended). He has some of the funniest lines in the film and has toendure the most ridiculous costumes. There were times when I wonderedhow anyone could keep a straight face, but Bachar managed to pull itoff.   The other big role, that of Maxxx probably wasn't too challenging, andJacobs was thankfully good in the part. There were dozens of other smallparts, and not a single one of them left a bad actor taste.   ORGAZMO is rated NC-17, but don't let that stigmatize it for you (itprobably should have been an R). The comedy is very mainstream and thereis no full frontal nudity (though there are several ... ahem...artificial members). It's difficult to make a convincing argument forhow funny a movie is without giving away the jokes. But trust me, thismovie is very funny. If you are at all titillated - and not too easilyoffended - go see this movie. ",Orgazmo,NC-17,1998,3

697," ""Pretty Woman"" director Garry Marshall has struck gold, onceagain, with this fresh, engaging, provocative story of a mentallychallenged young woman (Juliette Lewis) who returns from ten years ofconfinement in a special school determined to lead an independentlife, much to the chagrin of her guilty, indulgent father (TomSkerritt) and smothering, over-protective mother (Diane Keaton). Whenshe falls in love with a similarly impaired man (Giovanni Ribisi) anddemands her own apartment, their concern turns to absolute panic, asthe story revolves around the parental dilemma of what to do when achild with special needs becomes an adult.  Juliette Lewis ismagnificently vibrant and totally captivating as the defiantly spunkywoman whom her doctor describes as ""pushing the edge of the envelope.""And Giovanni Ribisi is endearingly vulnerable as a man besotted bymarching bands, yet haunted by taunts of ""retard."" Having never dated- with only the sketchiest knowledge of sex - their romance isinnocently awkward, painfully poignant, and hilariously funny. ""Iwonder who thought up sex in the first place,"" she muses in onecleverly comical scene. ""I think it was Madonna,"" he answers, quiteseriously. As co-writer with Bob Brunner, Gary Marshall's sensitivityis apparent, allowing the audience to enjoy and empathize with thesetwo young people who embark on a challenging journey ofself-discovery. The only weakness of the film lies with the cliche'dwriting of the parents' roles and the so-called ""normal "" sisters: oneengaged, the other a lesbian.

The action takes place during the1920's in French Indochine (now Vietnam, Cambodia andLaos). The picture is not only a Discovery Channel offering writlarge but has stuff to say about environmentalism, colonialism,rapaciousness and cultural differences among SoutheastAsians, British and French. (The French all speak English forthe benefit of kids ages six to eight who will love the moviethough they may not yet know how to read subtitles if they areproducts of our public school system.) Annaud, whose 1989 feature ""The Bear"" deals with a cub who isorphaned and forced to fend for itself until it finds a newprotector in a giant Kodiak targeted by hunters, is in his element.With a storyline that could be heartily approved by RudyardKipling, Arnaud takes us to a land or big adorable cats, evilhunters and greedy mercenaries, even to London where to thesurprise of an auctioneer nobody bids for ivory tusks but greatinterest is shown in illegally taken booty from Cambodia andsurroundings. The principal subjects aside from handsome and manly GuyPearce in the role of hunter-author Aidan McRory are tigersiblings Koumal and Sangha. During the infancy their father iskilled (shades of Bambi) after which one infant, Koumal, is soldto a circus which abuses him into performing tricks while theother, Sangha, is taken by a rotund French official EugeneNormandin (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to be a pet for his son. Whenthe two cats escape and head back to the jungle_where authorMcRory insists they cannot survive having never learned tohunt_the tigers are said to be dangerous to the villagers:McRory is asked to shoot the two animals, but since the film istargeted to the small fry, he cannot bring himself to pull thetrigger. The dialogue is clunky and choppily edited, but who cares? Theeponymous characters and not the caricatured apparatchiks arewhat the kids come to see. The two brothers meet thechallenge, the shy brother bound to draw the oohs and ahs ofthe crowd particularly when in a game of hide and seek with theyoung lad, he hides in a bookshelf among the stuffed animals.If your child is motivated to ask you where the feline pups comefrom, unfortunately in this PG movie the sex scene is merelyhinted at during the beginning of the action following whichDreujou shyly draws his camera aside. To his credit Annaud lets the tigers speak for themselves andavoids dialogue during various segments of the pic, exceptwhen he inevitably suggests that the cats have a range ofhuman emotions and can communicate their fears, theirkinships, and their love for humans through an assortment ofcatcalls. The movie becomes repetitive at times, the storydifficult to follow, but the jungle photography and particularly thecloseups of Koumal and Sangha are spectacular.","Others, The",PG-13,2001,3.5
699,"There is time for peace and there is time for war. There istime for movies that take cautious approach to sensitive andcomplex issues and there is time for movies in which GoodGuys kick the living daylights out of Bad Guys withoutburdening themselves with any serious contemplation. Thetime in which we are living is the time for the latter, somovies like OUT FOR JUSTICE, directed in 1991 by John Flynn,would be more than appropriate.  The protagonist of this film is Gino Felino (played bySteven Seagal), New York police detective who grew up on themean streets of Brooklyn. His marriage is just about to end,but family issues suddenly take second place when he hearsthe news about his partner and best friend Bobby Lupo(played by Joe Spatara) getting brutally murdered in frontof his family. Since the perpetrator - crack-smoking andultraviolent Mafioso wannabe Richy Madano (played by WilliamForsythe) - has already been identified, the investigationactually turns into manhunt. Both police and Mafia take partin it, but hardly anyone shows the zeal equal to Felino whouses various (mostly violent) methods in order to extractinformation about Madano's whereabouts. As Felino begins toclose in, Madano and his small but vicious gang of streetdecide to hit back by targeting Felino's family.  Steven Seagal is arguably one of the worst actors inpresent-day Hollywood and his reputation wasn't helped bythe projects in which his ambitions turned out to be wayhigher than his abilities. Thankfully, OUT FOR JUSTICE,which he co-produced and co-wrote (including few songlyrics) is not one of them. Weak standard plot aboutpoliceman who avenges the death of his partner is nothingmore than an excuse for the series of scenes in which Seagaldisplays what he knows best - taking care of any individualor group foolish enough to challenge him in a various formsof physical combat. The script lacks the usual preachingtone of other Seagal's movies and the mean streets ofBrooklyn are used more to provide exotic flavour to thesetting than to serve as an illustration of drug addiction,crime, violence and other social ailments of pre-GiulianiNew York. Instead of moralising, film presents things likecorruption and symbiotic relationship between police andorganised crime as something quite natural and, at times,even beneficial to the society. And, naturally, in asituation when everyone wants to see quick justice done,issues like civil liberties and police procedure are thrownthrough the window. Steven Seagal's character might beobnoxious, intimidating and ultraviolent and the only thingthat actually align him to the forces of Good (apart fromcouple of obviously manipulative attempts to show hissensitive, altruistic side) is the fact that the villainsare even worse and, consequently, can be dealt only byhigher doses of their own medicine. Because of thatotherwise good character actor William Forsythe goes overthe top in his portrayal of homicidal cokehead. On the otherhand, other actors are quite solid in their roles, even whenthey are thankless, like those of Madano's brother andsister, played by Anthony De Sando and Gina Gershon.Director John Flynn is more than able to keep things undercontrol and the film goes quite smoothly for 90 minutes,leaving hardly any time for audience to pick various flawsin the film. In the end, authors of OUT FOR JUSTICE can beforgiven for cliched storyline, cartoonish characters andridiculous amounts of senseless violence - few films managedto show how Good can defeat Evil in such a simple andentertaining way. ",Out For Justice,R,1991,2
700,"      Some movies have dog written all over them.  The more I saw thetrailers to OUT TO SEA, the more I dreaded its screening.  Butsometimes, even seemingly hopeless films can prove better than one hasany reason to expect.  So it is with OUT TO SEA, a romantic buddypicture starring Walter Matthau (I'M NOT RAPPAPORT) and Jack Lemmon (MYFELLOW AMERICANS) as cruise dance hosts, Charlie and Herb.       For our screening, they bussed in a load of seniors from a localretirement home, but everyone, young and old, in the audience laughedright along with old pros Matthau and Lemmon.  Still, I would be remiseif I did not admit that the show will be better received by the olderfolks than the younger ones.  For those of us who can appreciateangst-filled Gen X movies, action thrillers, and chick flicks, surelywe can enjoy the humor from a couple of film veterans in their 70s.  Asthe ending credits rolled (complete with sweet dance numbers followedby some hilarious out-takes), my wife and I gave each other aI-can't-believe-the-show-was-actually-funny look.       Ever conniving gambler Walter has conned Jack into joining him ona ""free"" cruise.  Once on board, Jack realizes that to get their tinycabins, Walter has signed them up as dance hosts.       Walter spends his time on the ship avoiding dancing throughvarious ruses while ogling the passengers.  (""Did you see the chassison that broad?  I bet she's worth a fortune."")       At this point in the show, I sat there smugly confident that myprediction of bomb would be right.  Then a strange thing begin tohappen.  As I watched the actors, their genuineness begin to take hold.A bit hunched over, they had charisma and style, and they craftedcharacters that were compelling even if sometimes too outlandish.       Brent Spiner (Lt. Cmdr. Data from STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT) playsprissy Gil Godwyn, the CD (Cruise Director), who is ""a bit of a Nazi.""He demands obedience from his dance hosts and thus is constantly atodds with Charlie.       Lemon plays his part seriously.  Herb is filled with absoluteterror at the idea of dancing with a horde of spinsters and widows.  Asthey descend on the poor hosts at the first dance of the cruise, hereflects, ""It's just like the beach at Normandy.""       Surprisingly, the best part of the picture is a realistic romancebetween Charlie and a gold digger named Liz LaBreche played withinfectious fun by Dyan Cannon.  Cannon, who is just a few months shy of60, looks extremely sexy and 20 to 25 years younger.  Cannon is a twotime Oscar nominee whom I had not thought about in years.  With herlively performance in the film, she holds her own against the twobigger stars.       Liz shares her large stateroom with her tough talking mom, Mrs.Carruthers (Rue McClanahan), who sounds like she eats nails forbreakfast and who looks a few years younger than Charlie.  ""I saw theway you were looking at my daughter's breasts,"" Liz warns Charlie.Without missing a beat, he shoots back, ""I used to a cardiologist.""       Lonely Herb provides the show with poignancy.  He was married for47 years, and his dead wife still has his heart.  He shocks himself byfalling head over heels in love with a passenger named Vivian (GloriaDeHaven) and she with him until a misunderstanding comes between them.Charlie advises his old buddy not to give up.  (""No such thing as toolate.  That's why they invented death."")       Audience reactions can sometimes add to the movie-goingexperience.  So it was at our screening.  When Herb planted a big(closed mouth) kiss on Vivian, our audience went ""oooh"" almost inunison, with the younger ones making the loudest sounds.  It was as ifthere were subliminal clue cards flickering on the screen.       Soon after Charlie and Herb first board the ship, cruise hostJonathan (Donald O'Connor) asks them if they have any questions.  ""Yea,I have a question,"" Herb blurts out.  ""How do you get off this ship?""You may feel the same way in the beginning, but stay aboard and getyour sea legs.  You'll meet some new friends and have some good laughswith them.  Certainly not the best cruise of your cinematic life, but apleasurable one nevertheless.       OUT TO SEA runs about 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for a little mildlanguage and some sexual humor.  The show would be fine for kids of anyage, but they would probably need to be nine or so to enjoy it.  Ican't believe it, but I am actually recommending this show, not only tothe seniors, who should especially love it, but to a general audience.It gets ** 1/2. ",Out to Sea,PG-13,1997,2
701," Based on the 1970 comedy written by Neil Simon and starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, the '90s update of ""The Out-of-Towners"" contains the same basic plot, but comparisons pretty much end right there. Although the film doesn't have what it takes to pull over to the side of comic brilliance, the movie is fast-paced and enjoyable enough, aided by the dynamite duo of Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn.  Unhappy Ohio suburbanites Henry (Martin) and Nancy Clark (Hawn) are suffering through separate mid-life crisises. While Henry is harboring the secret that he has been laid off from his job and is about to travel to New York City to be interviewed for a high-profile advertising position, Nancy is depressed because all of their adult children have finally left the nest and her relationship with Henry has seriously dwindled. On the spur of the moment, Nancy decides to accompany Henry on his trip, and that is the start of a wild, dangerous, and crazy 24-hour period of hijinx in the city that never sleeps. It's pretty safe to say that almost every outrageous thing that could happen does happen.   ""The Out-of-Towners"" has two things going for it and, walking into the theater, you knew that at least one of them couldn't fail (the partnering of Martin and Hawn). Martin is one of the great modern-day comedians (as far as I'm concerned, he is funnier than all of the recent ones, like Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler), while Hawn is always a bright and winning presence. Since they both have perfect comic timing, many of the jokes were bound not to fail, and there are many that are downright hilarious (on the other hand, a few fall flat). One of the scenes that gave me the loudest laugh was when Nancy is reading the map to Henry as they are driving to the city. ""You know this upcoming exit?"" Nancy asks. Henry immediately turns off onto the exit. ""Well, keep going past that,"" Nancy continues. Very funny. And how about the sequence where they accidentally walk in on a sexaholics anonymous meeting within a church and get caught up within the group discussion. These delightful moments are also thanks to the second reason the film is an overall successful venture, and that is Marc Lawrence's slight, but constantly snappy screenplay.  In a memorable supporting role, John Cleese plays the manager of a ritzy New York hotel who gets involved in the couple's plight and is discovered later on by Nancy dancing around a hotel room in women's clothes and stiletto high heels. Cleese has some subtly amusing moments, particularly one in which, while in the hotel's lobby, he stops for a second to admire a customer's outfit. Meanwhile, mayor Rudy Giuliani appears in a cameo and could have been used to fabulously zany effect in one of the film's key scenes, but is wasted and thrown to the wayside.  Inevitably, through all of the various mishaps that occur, Henry and Nancy start to come to terms with their marriage and begin to fall in love with each other all over again. It may very well be predictable (and it is), but it is the high energy of Martin and Hawn that keeps this light-as-a-feather comedy afloat. I hope they work together again real soon. ","Out-of-Towners, The",PG-13,1999,2
702,"      OUTBREAK is a detective story and a thriller about a germ.  It wasproduced and directed by Wolfgang Petersen of DAS BOOT and IN THE LINEOF FIRE fame.  This is a director who knows how to create great tensionthat really grabs the audience's attention and holds it through out theentire movie.  He is also a master at action sequences and the militaryhelicopter scenes in this flick were evidence of his abilities as wellas that of the cinematographer.       OUTBREAK starts in a remote village in Zaire.  From the verybeginning of the show we know that there is a virus of cataclysmicproportions.  It works so fast that if you are not dead in twenty-fourhours after being exposed, you are safe.  This germ detective story isexcellent and the pacing is good so that your eyes stay glued to thescreen.  Go to the bathroom before entering, you don't want to miss anyof the details.  It is complex and yet quite easy to follow.       The germ detective work had much the flavor of the movie AND THEBAND PLAYED ON about the hunt for the source of the AIDS illness.OUTBREAK at its best was almost as good.  Petersen is a masterdirector.       After seeing this movie, I should warn you that you may never wantto fly in airplanes again.  You certainly will find yourself leavingany theater where someone coughs.       Sad to say, we also learn from the beginning that there is asubplot in the show that is going to have us believe that our militaryhas some covert operations of massively evil proportions going on.Without this ridiculous and unnecessary sojourn into again lambastingour own generals, the movie had a perfectly plausible ring to it.       The acting was uneven.  Dustin Hoffman, whom I have not seen inmany movies recently, stars as the military chief of biologicalresearch.  His research was on finding the causes of and curing viralinfections--not on developing killer germs.  Hoffman delivers starquality work.  He is totally believable and never goes overboard withhis acing which he has been known to do in other films.       Also excellent in the show was Hoffman's sidekick played by CubaGooding Jr.  He played the aggressive green recruit character in freshand interesting ways.  He enliven every scene he was in.       Rene Russo who was so excellent in Petersen's last show, IN THELINE OF FIRE, was given a poorly written part as Hoffman's domesticcounterpart--the head of germ research at the CDC.  She was also hisex-wife.  (Believably, having an ex-wife as beautiful as Russo, Hoffmanspent most of the movie trying to get her back.) Russo's acting was notcredible and moreover, I would just as soon have seen her whole parteliminated.  The germ research had the energy to stand on its own anddid not need a romantic second subplot to add excitement to the movie.       Another tragedy of the film was the wasting of Morgan Freeman asHoffman's commanding general.  This was the weakest character Freemanhas ever been asked to play--very one dimensional.  This brilliantactor (GLORY, DRIVING MISS DAISY, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, etc.) didnot seem to care about the show and gave a pedestrian performance.Finally, the less said about Donald Sutherland's part as the MajorGeneral who was Freeman's boss, the better.  Both characters werecliches that should not have been in a movie of this caliber.       OUTBREAK runs an exciting 2:00.  It is rated R for bleedingeyeballs and other makeup effects that you see on Halloween masks.There was a 10 year old behind me that loved the movie.  I recommendthis tension filled detective story to everyone above the age of about9, and I award it ***.  Absent the unnecessary diabolical militarysubplot, I would have been able to give the movie another half star. ",Outbreak,R,1995,2
703,"Seemingly harmless words can often have great consequences.Something like that probably happened in early 1980s when atleast one of the critics watched OUTLAND, science fictionthriller directed by Peter Hyams and used the phrase ""HIGHNOON in space"" in its review. From that point onward, PeterHyams lost any hope of having his movie judged by its ownmerit. Unavoidable comparison between this 1980s SF-thrillerand 1950s cult western were usually in favour of the latter,and more snobbish of the critics saw OUTLAND as the hack job- lame attempt to cash on late 1970s science fiction crazeby scavenging American movie heritage. Because of this,reputation of the film suffered and two decades laterOUTLAND is one of the most tragically underrated films ofall time.  Plot of the movie is set in relatively near future and ittakes place on Io, Jupiter's moon which became site ofprofitable mining operation. Mining rig Con-Am 27 is mannedby around 2000 people - miners, maintenance workers,administration and similar kind of personal. Demanding job,claustrophobic condition and insulation from the rest ofhumanity take a heavy toll on people's psychological healthand it isn't unusual for them to commit suicide or go onseemingly unprovoked killing rampage. However, for WilliamT. O'Neil (played by Sean Connery), head of mining colony'ssmall police force, bizarre form and increasingly highnumber of such incidents are the reason enough to start theinvestigation. With the reluctant help of colony'sworld-weary physician Dr. Lazarus (played by FrancesSternhagen) he discovers that the victims had been addictedto powerful amphetamine. Since mining company's executiveSheppard (played by Peter Boyle) brags about his workersbeing more productive than usual, O'Neil soon quickly addstwo and two and uncovers widespread drug-dealing business.But his attempt to bring Sheppard to justice is going to puthis life in danger; by uncovering the scheme O'Neil hadstepped on too many powerful toes and a team of professionalassassins is sent to mining colony in order to take care ofhim. While the shuttle with assassins slowly arrives, O'Neildesperately wants to find help, but everyone, even hissubordinates, finds good excuses for not being around thelone lawman when the inevitable showdown happens.  Peter Hyams in his script for OUTLAND indeed borrows someelements from HIGH NOON - lone hero facing impeding showdownwith villains in order to rescue community apathetic towardshis cause - but those elements are visible only in the lastsegment of the film, in the scenes immediately before theshowdown. More explicit source of inspiration for OUTLANDcould be found in Ridley Scott's ALIEN, which was made onlytwo years before. Similarities between two films go waybeyond musical soundtracks (both written by Jerry Goldsmith)or opening titles; the plot setting and the atmosphere inthe film is almost identical and good case can be made aboutOUTLAND and ALIEN sharing the same universe. OUTLAND, sameas many great science fiction films of late 1970s and early1980s, takes rather dystopian view of mankind's future. Ifmankind's future lies in conquest of space, such endeavouris going to be motivated by simple greed more than any nobleidea. And such endeavour is going to depend on blue collarworkers more prone to succumb to human weaknesses - bothphysical and psychological - than their present- daycounterparts. And even the establishment, symbolised ininvisible but all-powerful entities of multinationalcorporations, is going to go ""native"" in such harsh,unforgiving environment and turn human life into expendablecommodity. Future depicted in OUTLAND is dark, depressiveand even the standard happy ending is not going tocompromise such powerful vision.  For some science fiction purists, OUTLAND lacks genrecredentials due to some scientific inaccuracies - mostnotable being the depiction of instant decompression tohuman body, used in the most memorable (and bloodiest)scenes of the film. Those flaws are, however, too few tobother anyone except the most ardent nit-pickers. Withoutthem, OUTLAND is film that built a very well-rounded worldof its own. The production design is very convincing, sameas the technology (law enforcement of the near future ismore likely to use pump-action shotguns than some cool buttoo destructive laser guns), and special effects are alsovery good and still look convincing after almost twodecades. Ironically, the only exception might be found inthe scenes that future hopelessly outdated 1980s computergraphic on video screens. But the general impression is morethan favourable and OUTLAND is as exciting science fictionin 2002 as it was in 1981.  The acting is somewhat disappointing. Sean Connery is quitecapable in rather one- dimensional role of lone hero, whilePeter Boyle comfortably sleepwalks through the standard roleof corporate villain. Kika Markham is, on the other hand,terrible in the role of O'Neil's wife, completelyunnecessary character in completely unnecessary subplotdealing with hero's family. However, OUTLAND still has onemore than good acting performance thanks to FrancesSternhagen and her wonderful portrayal of cynical doctor.Character actor James B. Sikking is also quite effective ina small role of O'Neil's morally ambiguous partner. Thecharacters in this film are, however, subordinated to actionand Hyams more than delivers in that department. Actionscenes are well-placed within the film and the finalshowdown, involving one of the first outer space brawls inmotion picture history, is still impressive after all thistime.  As a result, OUTLAND is a remarkable example of its genre,both disturbing yet entertaining film and one of many hiddengems from the era when the future looked bleak. ",Outland,R,1981,3
704,"Don't expect another ""There's Something About Mary,"" justbecause this contemporary comedy is made by Peter and BobbyFarrelly. Instead of gross silliness, there's gloppy sentiment, asShawn Hatosy portrays a pot-smoking slacker teen, circa 1974, in theblue-collar town of Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  After a fender-benderwith a parked police car, he's packed off to a fancy Connecticut prepschool, Cornwall Academy, where he's outnumbered, outclassed, anddefinitely out of place. But he gets little sympathy from hisbeer-guzzling, loud-mouthed, deadbeat dad (Alec Baldwin) whose idea ofaffection is to nickname the boy ""Dildo."" ""It ain't easy being Ozziewhen you ain't got a Harriet,"" dad explains. Predictably - andsomewhat unimaginatively - Hatosy not only ends up with the prettiestgirl around (Amy Smart), protects his wheelchair-bound younger brother(Tommy Bone), and takes revenge on a repressive dean. Directed andco-written by Michael Corrente (""American Buffalo""), there are quirkytouches like a three-legged dog and some crude slapstick antics, butthere's nothing to make your hair stand on end about this prosaiccoming-of-age story set. Not surprising since the script was recycledfrom long before the Farrelly brothers had hits like ""Dumb andDumber."" And the edgy comedy ""Rushmore,"" released early this year,covered the same territory far better. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1to 10, ""Outside Providence"" is a flimsy 5.

It is none other than Francis Ford Coppola who made the film afterAPOCALYPSE NOW and the first two GODFATHERs.    The movie's stilted dialog is by first-time screenwriter Kathleen Rowell, whowent on to write screenplays for television movies.  With few natural scenes inthe film, the acting is never convincing.  The movie plays like one longintroductory class in method acting.  Compare, for example, the pretentiousperformances in THE OUTSIDERS with the more recent BULLY by Larry Clark, whichwas frighteningly realistic with the actors delivering translucent and rivetingperformances.  The story, set in the late 1950s, is a classic one of rich vs. poor as the richkids called ""socs"" mistreat the poor ones known as ""greasers.""  Rather thanending in the big game, it culminates in the big rumble as the greasers try toget their revenge.  The best part of the movie is the sometimes deliciously dreamy and other timesdecidedly dramatic score by Carmine Coppola.  But, like the rest of the movie,it has its problems, namely that it never fits.  In Carmine Coppola's defense,one suspects that if the acting were more credible, the music might not havefelt so out of place.    Read the book.  Skip the movie.  THE OUTSIDERS runs 1:31.  It is rated PG for violence.  The film was releasedbefore the PG-13 rating was introduced.  If it were released today, it would bePG-13.

706,"PAID IN FULL is a formulaic film by director Charles Stone III, who brought usthe popular ""Whassup?"" Budweiser commercials.  Something of a blend of THEBLACKBOARD JUNGLE and SCARFACE, the story is set in a ghetto in Harlem in themid-1980s.  The local royalty are the drug dealers who flaunt the symbols of power -- bigwads of cash, gold chains, fancy cars and Nikes.  The central character, Ace(Wood Harris, REMEMBER THE TITANS), ironically was called Lucky when he waslittle.  Now he's a kid -- actually more of a young adult -- about to be seducedby the dark side.  He is currently working at one of the few honestestablishments, a cleaners -- nice metaphor.    One way that we know that Ace would be worth saving is that, once he has beenconverted to dealing drugs, he proves to be a real entrepreneur.  While mostdealers hold out for top dollar, Ace cuts the price of his product in order todramatically increase the volume and hence the profits.  Filmed in somber, dark tones, the movie is sometimes hard to decipher.  Thedialog is tougher still, since the ghetto accents and slang are so thick thatyou may find yourself wishing that the movie had subtitles.  Although it's apoignant drama, it's nothing original.  If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turnit off, convinced that you had already seen that movie.  PAID IN FULL runs 1:33.

707,"      THE PALLBEARER is THE GRADUATE for the 90s.  The locale has beenshifted to Brooklyn and the protagonist lives only with hisinsufferable mother (Carol Kane), but the rest of the major storyelements are in place.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a literalremake, but if you try to count the number of similarities, you willsoon lose track.  First, and foremost, the twenty-five year old leadcharacter, Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer), sounds and acts like DustinHoffman did in THE GRADUATE.       The set up for THE PALLBEARER is that Ruth Abernathy (BarbaraHershey), referred to in the film, of course, as Mrs. Abernathy a laMrs. Robinson, calls Tom and asks him to be a Pallbearer at her sonBill's funeral.  There is a small problem in that, although Tom went tohigh school with Bill, he does not remember him at all.  Moreover, noneof his friends from high school, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), BradSchorr (Michael Rapaport), Cynthia Edelman (Toni Collette from MURIEL'SWEDDING), Scott Edelman (Michael Vartan), and Lauren (Bitty Schram),can remember Bill either.  When they look up Bill's picture in theannual, it is blank, and the only info is that he was in the chessclub.       Soon it goes from bad to worse as Ruth becomes convinced that Tomwas Bill's best friend and so gets Tom to agree to do the eulogy.  Tomstarts off with ""Who is Bill Abernathy?  This is not an easy questionto answer.""  He then goes on to wing it with his friends in the pews institches.  The speech felt like it was lifted straight from HughGrant's wedding speech in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.  This is onederivative show from beginning to end.       Just like in THE GRADUATE, Tom falls in love with the naturallybeautiful Julie who is his age.  At the same time, the older, heavilymade-up, peroxide blonde Mrs. Abernathy seduces him.  This puts him inan untenable situation.  Remember the problems this caused in THEGRADUATE?  Well, many of them are replayed here, but not as well.       The problem with THE PALLBEARER has nothing to do with the castingor the acting.  Most of the acting, with the exception of the poorperformance by Hershey, is fine.  The problem is the script by JasonKatims and the directing by Matt Reeves.  The show is kept at thesuperficial level.  There is not a character that is real or that youcare about.  Now, strictly as escapist entertainment, it almost works.Certainly there are many big laughs in the show, but I left the moviefeeling a bit cheated and unsatisfied.  The film just does not realizeits potential.       THE PALLBEARER runs too long at 1:46.  It is rated PG-13, but itis a mild PG-13.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence, and thelanguage is pretty tame.  It would be fine for kids over 9 although Isuspect, given the subject matter, it might be more appropriate forthose over 12.  Several big laughs were not enough to get me torecommend this retread, but I am giving it ** for the laughs and forDavid Schwimmer's performance. ","Pallbearer, The",PG-13,1996,2
708,"A superb exercise in eliciting suspense out of simple, progressivelysticky situations, ""Panic Room"" is a taut, exciting thriller. Thatthe film primarily takes place inside a single room over one nightand still obtains the ability to rachet up almost unbearable tensionis a testament to the superior filmmaking abilities of director DavidFincher (1999's ""Fight Club""). Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) is a caring single mother going throughboth a painful divorce and the tedious process of searching for anew home to move into with her 14-year-old daughter, Sarah (KristenStewart). They seemingly find their dream house in an enormous Brownstonelocated on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, complete with spaciousrooms, an elevator, a high-tech security system, and a place calledthe ""panic room""--a steel-plated refuge designed to keep out intruders. On their first night there, they are awakened by the sounds of threemen who have just broken in. Locking themselves in the ""panic room,""Meg and Sarah are equipped with camera monitors that convenientlycapture the goings-on in every room of the house. Thinking they maybe safe if they stay there long enough, they are distressed to findthat what the three dangerous men--Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Junior(Jared Leto), and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam)--want is in that very room.Making matters worse, the diabetic Sarah is growing more and moreill without her insulin shots and any sugar. Ingeniously written by David Koepp (1999's ""Stir of Echoes""), ""PanicRoom"" stands as a sterling example of how to make a thriller the rightway. Along with cinematographers Conrad W. Hall (1999's ""AmericanBeauty"") and Darius Khondji's (1999's ""In Dreams"") marvelously atmosphericcamera work, director Fincher makes the most of a film set in suchan enclosed space. One seemingly unbroken shot is especially a stunner,as it starts off with Meg in bed, travels downstairs, through thehandle on a coffee pot in the kitchen, follows the intruders outsideas they try to find a way into the house, and finally goes into thekeyhole of the front door. Fincher also uses the life-threatening situations at hand to optimaleffect, such as a sequence where the men send propane gas into theair ducts of the ""panic room,"" and another where Meg quietly sneaksout of the room to find her cell phone, with the men right outsidethe door. It is clear every step of the way that ""Panic Room"" is moreof an exercise in style than a deep, thought-provoking motion picture,but it does it extremely well. As Meg, Jodie Foster (1999's ""Anna and the King"") makes for the perfectstrong-willed protagonist. While her character is slimly developed,Foster is so adept at subtlety and realism in her acting style thatall you really need to know about her is found in her body languageand expressive facial expressions. In newcomer Kristen Stewart, youcouldn't find a more dead ringer to play Foster's daughter if youtried. Luckily, the young Stewart also appears to have the actingchops to fulfill the requirements of the role. As the three thieves,the always good Forest Whitaker (2000's ""Battlefield Earth"") addsgreat depth to the most soft-spoken and humane of the trio, whileJared Leto (2000's ""American Psycho"") and Dwight Yoakam (1996's ""SlingBlade"") ably support him. For all of the technical and stylistic artistry involved in bringing""Panic Room"" to life (the marvelously inventive opening credits sequenceis also worth noting), with the end credits comes a curious feelingof having had a fun time, but nothing more. The film doesn't reallyachieve much in its 109 minutes, nor does Meg or any of the othercharacters go through a much-needed catharsis needed to make the finalmoments more satisfying. Still, these minor shortcomings are a smallprice to pay for a film in the thriller genre that is as genuinelyelectrifying as ""Panic Room"" is.",Panic Room,R,2002,2.5

710," In today's world of journalism, dominated by television,Internet and ""news as entertainment"" business philosophy,printed newspapers are considered to be the thing of thepast. Same thing happened to the perception of journalistsas fearless crusaders for truth and justice in this cynicalage. As a result, once thriving subgenre of journalismmovies almost disappeared from Hollywood. THE PAPER, 1994drama by Ron Howard, represents one of those precious filmsthat deal with realities of life of modern newspaperreporters.  The screenplay of THE PAPER, written by brother David andStephen Koepp, follows 24 hours in lives of reporters andeditors in ""New York Sun"" tabloid newspaper. The nominalprotagonist of the film is Henry Hackett (played by MichaelKeaton), workaholic editor who loves his job. But longhours, low pay and uncertain future of the tabloid lead himto think about new career. His pregnant wife Martha (playedby Marisa Tomei) urges him to think about better-paid butmore boring job in respectable ""New York Sentinel""newspaper. In the meantime, rapidly developing story abouttwo black teenagers being arrested for racially motivatedmurders would represent another opportunity for Hackett touse his skills of investigative reporter. Results of hisinvestigation, on the other hand, would later lead todramatic confrontations with bullish managing editor AliciaClark (played by Glenn Close).  Judging by some of American newspaper movie reviews, Koeppbrothers in their screenplay managed to paint ratherconvincing picture of the life in modern editorial offices.According to medical statistics in many countries, newsreporters and editors have shorter average lifespan thanthose belonging to other professions and THE PAPER explainsthe causes of this phenomenon - deadline, editorialpressures and consequent stress that leads to chain-smokingand alcoholism, and, naturally, all that has devastatingeffects on reporters' personal lives. Ron Howard is faithfulto this gritty picture laced with black humour, but henevertheless adds some Hollywood touch with few moralisingscenes and melodramatic finale that went over the top withsome of the cliches (including notorious ""Stop the presses!""line). However, THE PAPER compensates these flaws with trulygreat ensemble cast that relies more on character actorslike Keaton, Tomei, Close, Robert Duvall and Randy QuaidTomei than standard Hollywood stars. Because of them,realistic atmosphere of modern-day editorial offices isn'tlost. THE PAPER, therefore, is a film that should berecommended as skillfully done example of almost forgottendramatic subgenre. ","Paper, The",R,1994,3
711,"School shootings and similar incidents that shocked Americain late 1990s created impression of modern society rapidlydescending into mindless violence, unprecedented in allprevious era. However, things can get even worse, at leastif we are to believe the authors of PAST PERFECT, 1996Canadian science fiction thriller directed by Jonathan Heap(and distributed in 1998). The future society is going to beso overwhelmed with the rampaging hordes of violentcriminals that the forces of law and order would have toadopt the most bizarre and drastic methods to solve thisproblem. In present-day Seattle police detective DylanCooper (played by Eric Roberts) encounters this solutionwhile trying to bring down the gang of vicious gun dealingteenagers. When the gang members start turning up dead,apparently being the victims of execution-style murders,Cooper is intrigued and wants to protect the last survivingmember Rusty Walker (played by Mark Hildreth). His effortswould lead with confrontation with the team of timetravelling assassins, led by psychopathic Stone (played byNick Mancuso), who were sent from the future in order toeliminate murderous criminals in their youth, thuspreventing their future crimes. While dealing with thisproblem, Cooper would not only have to make some tough moralchoices, but also to confront some ghosts from his ownpasts.  Unstoppable cyborg assassins, time travel, gun battlesinvolving teenagers and American industrial wasteland - allthat would give impression of PAST PERFECT being nothingmore than a cheap imitation of THE TERMINATOR. However, thescript by John Penney at least tried to do something more -to seriously explore the causes of juvenile delinquency inmodern world and give his opinion in the millennia-olddebate between proponents of pre- determinism and free will.Unfortunately, Penney's answer to this question comes in theform of convoluted plot elements that suddenly appear halfway through the film. Credibility of PAST PERFECT is furtherdiminished by Penney's refusal to deal with the issues oftime travel paradox. Finally, any serious meaning in thisfilm is drowned by the cheesy special effects, obligatorycar chases, explosions and gun battles and generally baddirection by Jonathan Heap. The cast is, on the other hand,strong for this kind of films and, apart from alwaysunderrated Eric Roberts, features respected character actorslike Nick Mancuso and Saul Rubinek.

Based on the 1993book ""Gesundheit: Good Health is a Laughing Matter"" by Hunter DohertyAdams, the film's timely theme is the therapeutic value of humor,characterized by a personalized approach to medicine, but writer SteveOedekerk and director Tom Shadyac cater to Williams' talent forimprovisation. The story begins in 1969 in Fairfax Hospital'sPsychiatric Ward, where Patch voluntarily commits himself afterattempting suicide and acquires his nickname by repairing anotherinmate's paper cup with a piece of adhesive.  Patch then moves on toVirginia Medical College where, as an idealistic med student, he wantsto ""treat the patient as well as the disease.""

In 1776 in South Carolina, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), aformer hero of the French and Indian War, is now a widower and devotedfather of seven children. Rebuking those who advocate war againstEngland's King George III over taxation, he's become a pacifist -until the battle literally lands in his backyard, as a cruel, arrogantBritish colonel (Jason Isaacs) deliberately murders an innocentchild. Savage, bloody revenge quickly follows as Martin, wielding aCherokee tomahawk, organizes the civilian militia. These excellentmarksmen are guerrilla fighters, avoiding muzzle-to-muzzleconfrontations with Redcoats in an open field. But Martin's not thereal patriot - that honor goes to his idealistic son Gabriel (HeathLedger), whose early enlistment in the Colonial Army is motivated byprinciple. Written by Robert Rodat (""Saving Private Ryan"") anddirected by Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day""), it's a challenging,exciting, character-driven story, capturing the human element that istoo often lost in history - with heart-wrenching moments like meltinga lead toy soldier into ammunition. As the tale's emotional pivot, theconflicted father and reluctant hero, Mel Gibson delivers a touching,tautly textured performance, ably supported by Heath Ledger, JasonIsaacs, Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo, Rene Aubjonois, Lisa Brenner andTom Wilkinson.

Benny, on the other hand, is a character you've seen athousand times before, and Mohr brings nothing new to that role.       Roberts's deliberately slow pacing of Laurie Craig's script lendsa subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems.When a kids' movie wants to mosey along, watch out.  If the material isnot crisp and perfectly composed, beauty can sometimes dissolve intotedium.  So it is with PAULIE.  When they let their bird do hisstand-up comedy routines, the show hums and the audience roars.  Toooften, however, a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they waitfor the story to pickup again.       Tony Shalhoub, the smart-mouthed chef from BIG NIGHT, plays Misha,a recent Russian immigrant to the U.S.  He had been a teacher ofliterature at home, but now he makes his living as a janitor in theanimal research lab to which Paulie has been taken for study.  AlthoughMisha gets a few nice lines (""I'm Russian.  I like long stories.""), hissomber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy.       Besides Paulie, the only character worth noting - other than 2cute small parts played by Cheech Marin and Gina Rowlands - is thespeech-impaired Marie, played in a precious performance by cinematicnewcomer, 5-year-old Hallie Kate Eisenberg.  Naturally enchanting, shegives the picture genuine heart.  The bad news is that her part isconfined to the first half.       The best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show offhis comedic skills.  When Marie's family gets a cat, for example, thebird, who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then, takes aninstant interest in soaring.  Tricking the cat while insulting him atthe same time, Paulie calls him a stupid hairball.  Their rapidphysical antics add to the humor of the situation.  It's good qualitysitcom material but performed by animals.       When one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing,Paulie cringes.  ""I'm a bird,"" he explains with his frequently subtlehumor.  ""I have a small brain, and it's about to explode.""  The moviecontains rich doses of John Debney's dreamy music.  With heavy use of asolo violin, he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes.  Andwhen Paulie finally takes off in flight, the orchestra comes up loudand strong with cymbals clashing.       ""It's a long story,"" says Paulie.

At 11, Trevor is one of the smallest and youngest kids in his class.  And with AWOL parents, he is wise and serious beyond his years.  As Trevor, Haley Joel Osment, Oscar nominee for THE SIXTH SENSE, is amazing again.  This role, however, isn't nearly as meaty as his last; so don't expect to see any nominations for him this time.  ""So you'll like flunk us if we don't change the world?"" Trevor demands to know in a quizzical panic.  ""No, you might just squeak by on a 'C,'"" Eugene shoots back with a delicate mixture of sweet humor and biting sarcasm.  Trevor eventually comes up with an idea along the lines of a Good Samaritan chain letter.  His simple plan is that people should do good deeds for three other people.  His rules: ""#1 it has to be something that really helps people, #2 something they can't do by themselves and #3 I do it for them, they do it for three other people.""  The only caveat is that people can't pay it ""back.""  They can only pay it ""forward,"" i.e., they must do something for someone else, not for the person who helped them.  Trevor's mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt), is one of the characters in need of a lot of help.  She is an admitted alcoholic with an abusive husband and a woman whose only friends are other drunks.  Working two jobs and drinking heavily when she is home, Arlene is rarely there for her son, either physically or emotionally.  One of their mother-son confrontations will have parents (and kids) in the audience flinching and perhaps even shedding a tear or two.  Arlene's husband, a fellow drunk, is currently in one of his long banishment periods.  Both Spacey and Hunt are made to look awful in the service of their craft.  Arlene, especially after a long night of boozing, doesn't look the least bit like Helen Hunt.  Although Arlene's make-up and clothes are convincingly terrible at first, she is spruced up too quickly, as if, in some scene left on the cutting room floor, she had a makeover by a beauty consultant.  In contrast, as the story advances, Eugene shows even more of his deep physical scars.  Jerry (James Caviezel, FREQUENCY), the first person who Trevor tries to help, is a street person with a heavy drug habit.  Eugene, Arlene and Jerry share several traits.  Eugene hides the story behind his burns.  Arlene hides her bottles like squirrels do nuts.  And Jerry just hides, period, lest Trevor find him shooting up again.  Similarly, Eugene lives for the rigidity of his precious schedule.  Arlene lives for her next drink.  And Jerry lives for his next fix.  Trevor and his pay-it-forward scheme change all of this.  A parallel story, which starts slightly in the future, has a newspaper man (Jay Mohr), who is himself befriended by a pay-it-forwarder, tracking down the origin of the movement.  Although it is an important adhesive for the storyline, this subplot never provides anywhere near the emotional or dramatic impact that it could have.  Overall, Leslie Dixon's script, based on Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel, is much better with the dialog than the narrative.  One of the many sharply written interchanges between Trevor and Eugene occurs when Eugene incorrectly thinks that Trevor is questioning his sincerity.  ""Do I strike you as someone being falsely nice?"" Eugene asks caustically.  ""No, you're not even really nice,"" Trevor replies with bitter honesty.  Although PAY IT FORWARD has more than enough to be able to recommend it, it does have two significant problems.  First, major plot twists are needlessly telegraphed, destroying what would otherwise have been dramatic surprises.  Second, the acting is frequently too subdued, and you can almost feel the director throttling back her cast.  Yes, there are some definitely saccharine scenes, but many others that should have had significant emotional impact come across surprisingly lukewarm.  This will probably be an unpopular opinion, but PAY IT FORWARD is that rare movie that would be more effective if it were schmaltzier.  PAY IT FORWARD runs a bit too long at 2:02.  It is rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including substance abuse/recovery, some sexual situations, language and brief violence.  It would probably be too strong for most kids under 13. ",Pay it Forward,PG-13,2000,2.5

Three years later, Jennings, who has his ownprivate agent Shorty (Paul Giamatti), is awakened and told,incredibly, that three years have passed, years that have nowbeen erased from his life.     Since ""Paycheck"" is a film directed by John Woo, who hasentertained action-adventure lovers with the likes of ""Face/Off""(federal agent agrees to have a heinous criminal's face graftedon his own), and ""Mission Impossible 2"" (action takes off when aruthless renegade spy captures a virus and its antidote andmurders its creator), we know we're in for somethingimaginative with the emphasis more on action than on rationaland thoroughly explicable plot lines.  That's what we get in DeanGeorgaris's adaptation of a story by the phenomenal sci-fi writerPhilip K. Dick whose output includes thirty novels in addition toa slew of short stories such as this one.        Philip K. Dick's writings transcend genre to examine thenature of reality and what it means to be human.  Withcomplexity and subtle humor, his stories are considered bysome critics to be the equal of the surreal tomes of Franz Kafkaand Kurt Vonnegut.  To see parallels with ""Paycheck,"" take alook at Dick's ""Adjustment Team,"" which explores the fate of aman who by mistake has stepped out of his own time.  Or lookinto ""Autofac,"" in which a community battles machines to takeback control of their lives.   The writer's imagination is capturedby Woo, but a thoughtful movie-goer might wish for moreexamination into the ethical dilemma posed by ""Paycheck""which has pretty much been displaced by dynamics of moreinterest to a mainstream audience.  The chase, which involves aride against the flow of traffic  through Vancouver's streets(substituting for Seattle) by Jennings with his girlfriend Rachel(Uma Thurman) in tow is breathtaking.  Less so are theredundant scenes of bullets and people crashing throughwindows to such an extent that had the title ""Shattered Glass""not already been spoken for this year (involving a  thoughtfulexamination of a journalist who faked stories for the NewRepublic magazine), the name ""Paycheck"" could have beenscrapped in its favor.     But ""Shattered Glass"" and ""Paycheck"" are not in the sameleague.  ""Paycheck"" is an expensive production loaded withactivities centering on the race for his life that Jennings takeswith Rachel, though he has no idea why his friend andemployer, Rethrick (nicely played by Aaron Eckhart, who hasbeen cast in far better roles by Neil LaBute e.g. ""In the Companyof Men""), is out to gun him down even though Jennings hadinexplicably agreed to forego the 92 million cash after goingthrough a crisis of conscience.     The ethical question posed by Philip K. Dick which is virtuallylost amid the races, crashes and gunplay, is: Can a nation (or aprivate corporation) morally justify the building and usage of amachine that can predict the future that can tell individualswhat's in store for them years later (thereby crushing hope andstriving in so many cases), or tell our nation whether an enemyis planning to go to war against us (and thereby trigger the veryconflict we're trying to prevent by attacking pre-emptively)?  Tome the answer is, sure, why not?  Wouldn't the U.S. like toavoid another Pearl Harbor by crushing powers bent on ourdestruction before the latter get a chance to strike?  Why notallow individuals to look into their future or not, giving them thefreedom to make their own choices?  Unfortunately the vision ofthe writer is clouded by the noise and violence, leaving a picturewhich, like the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is dazzling to lookwhile at the same time is spiritually empty. ",Paycheck,PG-13,2003,2.5
717,"Over the past decade, John Waters seems to have adopted a moremainstream ethos with his decidedly off beat comedies that satirisecertain elements of contemporary culture (Hairspray, Cry Baby andSerial Mom).  However, Baltimore's most notorious cult film maker hasstill not lost his flair for tasteless and tacky observations abouthuman nature.  Those more familiar with Waters' past work willprobably not be surprised that the director seems to have mellowedwith age and experience.  Nor will they be overly surprised at thealmost uncharacteristic restraint shown in Pecker.  Although Pecker isnowhere near as outrageous as his earlier films (Pink Flamingos, etc),there are still many moments in this clever and quite funny film thatwill shock or upset some elements within the audience.  One of Waters' better and more accessible films, Pecker is adry, witty and deliciously off beat take on the nature of celebrity,which often comes at a high price.  This is territory that has beenexplored recently by Woody Allen (Celebrity) and Ron Howard (Edtv),but Waters gives us his own idiosyncratic take on the issue. The filmalso pricks the pretensions of the sycophantic art world and New York(although sometimes the two are synonymous).  Waters also takes agentle swipe at the narrow minded attitudes and hypocrisy of theworking class in insular, small town America.  Pecker primarily traces the loss of innocence of its eponymoushero, played with a wonderful combination of appeal and naivet_ byT2's Edward Furlong.  Eighteen year old Pecker is an amateurphotographer who snaps candid shots of the residents of his hometownof Hampden.  When he arranges a small exhibition inside the sandwichshop where he works, Pecker's life changes.  He is discovered by Rorey(Lily Taylor, from I Shot Andy Warhol, etc), a voracious New Yorkdealer who quickly transforms him into the next big thing in the artworld.  But as fame and potential fortune are Pecker's for the taking,he finds that the unwelcome spotlight of media attention also falls onhis culturally challenged family as well as his friends.  Hisgirlfriend Shelley (beautifully played by teen indy queen ChristinaRicci, in a role originally intended for Ricki Lake), who officiouslyruns the town's laundromat, finds herself alienated from Pecker andhis sudden fame.  His kleptomaniac best friend Matt (played withenthusiasm by Brendon Sexton III, from Hurricane Streets, etc) alsofinds his lifestyle altered as he is unable to enter those storeswhere he practised his ""five fingered discounts.""  Even the townsfolk of Hampden turn on the gay subculture andthe sleazier elements that they had reluctantly tolerated for years,until they were thrust into the public spotlight through Pecker'spictures.  Pecker is faced with the choice of pursuing his art at allcosts or returning to the unassuming small town amateur he once was.  Waters traces Pecker's getting of wisdom with a raunchy humourand a real affection for the character.  He obviously identifiesstrongly with Pecker, and Furlong's sympathetic portrayal also endearshim to the audience.  The ensemble cast all deliver solid performancesand bring to life Waters' wonderfully colourful gallery of eccentriccharacters. ",Pecker,R,1998,3
718,"      ""If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, it willprotect all of you,"" explains pornographic magazine publisher LarryFlynt, played with bravado and panache by Woody Harrelson.       Two time Academy Award winning director Milos Forman (ONE FLEWOVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and AMADEUS) decided to make a red, white, andblue film about protecting American freedom, and he chose the unlikelyperson of Larry Flynt to be the protagonist.  One wonders if Forman hada list of candidates from David Duke on, but Flynt does fill the billas being a suitably unlikely hero.  You may have never thought aboutsomeone like Flynt being the guardian of your liberty, but inHarrelson's sympathetic portrayal of Flynt, he makes a compelling andcogent case.       The beauty of the film is that, even if you hate everything""Hustler"" magazine stands for and even if you disagree with Forman'slogic in the story, the film itself is so audaciously fun that it is acertain crowd pleaser.  No one has ever insulted people, especiallycourts, with such intense bravado as Flynt does in the movie.  You canbe sure that the picture will garner many an Academy Award nominationas it has already made most 1996 top ten lists.       After a brief start showing Flynt selling moonshine as a kid, thefilm skips ahead to Flynt in the 1970s running a sleazy strip joint inCincinnati.  He falls for a new stripper named Althea Leasure andbrilliantly played by Courtney Love.  She asks if it is true that hehas slept with every stripper in the club, and, when he concedes it istrue, she claims that she has too.  She will go on to become hislifelong business partner, lover, wife, and constant supporter, butwhen she first comes into his life, she has all the markings of aone-night stand.       Larry starts up ""Hustler"" as an offshoot from the club.  Themagazine almost goes under until an Italian photographer sells him nudephotos of ""Jackie O.""  After that, he is as rich as Croesus for therest of his life.  Although he will eventually be almost fatallywounded and spend much time in seclusion like Howard Hughes, he willmaintain a fabulously wealthy lifestyle.  When his parents first cometo visit his mansion during a party-turned-orgy, he explains, ""Theseare my friends -- lots of money, lots of friends.""  Since Althea andtwo of her girlfriends are making love on the bed where his parents aregoing to sleep, he sends the women to another room with promises tojoin them later in their fun.       His magazine's idea sessions are provocative.  They decide onsomeone to ridicule that week in an offensive sexual parody.  Theirtargets range widely from the Wizard of Oz to Santa Claus to JerryFalwell, played by look-alike Richard Paul.  Whenever someone suggeststhat something is too sick to print, Flynt ridicules them and makessure that the obscene cartoon or story runs exactly as proposed.       Eventually, Larry runs afoul of the law and loses.  His younglawyer, Alan Isaacman, played with determination by Edward North, cannot pull this one out.  ""25 years!"" exclaims Flynt.  ""All I'm guilty ofis bad taste.""       As you can already see, the script by Scott Alexander and LarryKaraszewski is full of deliciously funny morsels of dialog.  Thewording manages to be simultaneously humorous, believable, andinsightful.  Combine this with the tour de force acting by Harrelson,Love, and North, and you have the makings of a great movie.       People prosecuting poor pornographer Larry are not shown in thebest of lights as this is a fairly one sided presentation.  Typical isone of his judges who looks exactly like Jabba the Hut and is justabout as reasonable.  Still, Larry makes succinct and convincingarguments.  As he puts it, ""If you don't like Hustler magazine, don'tread it.""  ""I'm not trying to convince you to like what Larry Flyntdoes,"" confesses his own lawyer in his summation to the jury.  ""I don'tlike what Larry Flynt does.""       Whenever Larry gets in trouble, and he gets in trouble a lot,costume designers Arianne Phillips and Theodor Pistek like to dress himin the flag or at least the colors of the flag.  He also wears obsceneT-shirts designed to ridicule the judges during his trials.       In a large convention center made up to look like a Presidentialnominating convention, Larry address a crowd.  Behind him is a hugescreen projecting images of death and sex, and the hall is filled withred, white, and blue streamers.  ""What is more obscene?""  he asksrhetorically.  ""Sex or war?""  He then goes on to point out that if youtake a picture of someone committing a murder and put it on the coverof ""Time"", you may win a Pulitzer Prize.  If you take a picture ofsomeone committing sex or just a picture of a completely naked womanand put it on the cover of a magazine, you may be arrested and thrownin prison for obscenity.       Easily the strangest episode in Larry's life is when the thenpresident's sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton (Donna Hanover), convertsLarry to Christianity.  He decides he wants God brought into themagazine.  Even Althea thinks he has gone too far this time, arguing,""Nobody on this planet wants their religion and their pornographytogether.""  Eventually this phase will pass.  ""The reign of Christianterror is over,"" screams Althea to the magazine's staff.  ""We're goingback to our roots.  Porn is back.""       Believe it or not, I have merely scratched the surface of thisepic drama.  I did not get to the Charles Keating (James Cromwell) asworse than Larry Flynt subtext, the funny role of Clinton aide JamesCarville as an indignant prosecutor, the Supreme Court case, and themany drug scenes.       In perhaps the best scene in the show, Larry's lawyer quits indisgust at having such an unruly client.  ""I'm your dream client,""argues Larry, laughing off his lawyer's resignation.  ""I'm rich, andI'm always in trouble.""       You may or may not buy Larry Flynt as the saviour of yourfreedoms, his own daughter ridiculed the idea this week, but the movieis great and compelling cinema.  Words do not adequately describe itsscale or the effectiveness of its humor.       PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT runs 2:07, but its breadth made me think itwas much longer.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, violence, profanity,and hard drug usage.  This is a hard R film and would be appropriatefor teenagers only if they are quite mature.  Unbelievably, manyfamilies in my audience brought their young kids.  There were a dozenkids ages 3 to 7 near me.  Whenever lewd behavior would start on thescreen, the kids would ask their parents what was happening, but theywere consistently told to shut up.  I felt like grabbing the parents bytheir throats and asking if they had lost their minds.  For adults andmature teenagers, I recommend this film strongly to you and give thepicture *** 1/2. ",People vs. Larry Flynt,R,1996,3.5
719,"      Rule number one for successful affairs: Do not leave your weddingring behind at your lover's apartment.       Gorgeous and fabulously wealthy Emily Bradford Taylor has beenspending a lot of time lately with her favorite painter, theimpoverished David Shaw, and it's not just to admire his etchings.  Wewatch them kiss while rolling over and over in bed so they must be morethan just good friends.  (Sex in the movies is, well, different.)Although they naively believe that their clandestine relationship hasnot been discovered, Emily's husband, Steven, knows, and he plans toput a stop to it in a most unusual way.  He's going to offer David$500,000 to kill Emily.       A remake of Alfred Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER, A PERFECT MURDERis by Steven Seagal's action director Andrew Davis (ABOVE THE LAW andUNDER SIEGE), who seems lost remaking an intricate Hitchcockianthriller.  Without the usual explosions or constant violence topunctuate his movie, Davis has the cameras instead pan the Taylormansion so frequently that you may think it's the latest installment of""The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.""       As investment banker Steven Taylor, Michael Douglas gives usGordon Gecko-lite.  Patrick Smith Kelly's script needs more sharplydrawn characters.  Steven, for example, should be more ruthless andcoldly calculating.  Instead, he's a villain without much of acinematic punch.       As Steven's wife, Gwyneth Paltrow is certainly lovely, but shelacks the visceral vulnerability necessary for the suspense to buildproperly.  Paltrow seems more to be in a third parallel universe fromSLIDING DOORS than in a thriller.       Viggo Mortensen from G. I. JANE plays the sleazy lover and ""pettyswindler"" David.  Badly miscast, Mortensen gives a fairly lifelessperformance.  Never threatening or particularly convincing, Mortensenlooks relatively disinterested in the entire production.       David Suchet, television's Hercule Poirot, appears all too brieflyas Detective Mohamed Karaman.  His role, which could and should haveadded an interesting investigative part to the story, is neverdeveloped.  His character's sole purpose apparently is for Emily to beable demonstrate her foreign language dexterity.  She converses withhim in his native tongue to inquire about his family's health.       Once David accepts Steven's money, the story takes a few twistsand turns, but Davis stages the scenes without any regard for subtlety.He brings the camera in tight and has it frame the future murder weaponso that we all know in advance what will happen.  And when Steven dropsan envelope and paper with care, Davis zooms the camera in so we cansee David put his fingerprints on them.  Next, we watch Stevenmeticulously covering the fingerprinted materials in case anyone in theaudience missed the last obvious clue.  Davis doesn't want any""surprises"" that are not suitably preannounced.       In order to atone partially for the lackluster story, Davisinjects a heavy orchestral score by THE POSTMAN's James Newton Howard.With long violin notes, pianos in the low registers, and blaring Frenchhorns, we are reminded incessantly that this is a thriller no matterhow languid the pacing.       Having the ingredients for a mystery isn't the same thing asactually creating one.  One needs an accomplished chef to prepare thedish, and Davis needs explosions and fast actions to concoct acinematic treat.  He had the recipe right in THE FUGITIVE, but he haslong since lost it.  His blow 'em up extravaganza, CHAIN REACTION, washis last movie attempt, and it was a bomb in more ways than one.       A thriller without much genuine suspense isn't much of a thrillereven if the atmospherics are dead-on as they are in A PERFECT MURDER.The picture, however, is instructive.  In addition to the wedding ringrule, we learn that, if you're fabulously rich, don't forget thosepre-nups.       A PERFECT MURDER runs 1:47.  It is rated R for violence, profanityand sex and would be fine for most teenagers. ","Perfect Murder, A",R,1998,1.5
720," Wolfgang Petersen's ""The Perfect Storm,"" is a slam-bang, pulse-pounding action thriller that has the clear distinction of creating the most realistic and horrifying storm ever put to celluloid. This is appropriate, of course, since it is based upon the worst storm in recorded history that fell upon the New England border in October 1991, when three weather patterns (a cold front, a low-pressure system, and a hurricane) collided. With the awesome technology of Industrial Light & Magic, Petersen has crafted a technical masterpiece that puts you dead-center in the storm, surrounded by visual effects that never once call attention to themselves, and are always nothing less than believable.   The humans involved in the catastrophe hold no such scrutiny, but they are adequately developed enough that we care about them when their lives become in peril. The film focuses on the plight of the Andrea Gail, a boat holding a crew of fisherman from Gloucester, Mass., who have set out on the open seas for one last attempt to earn some extra money by catching swordfish. When skipper Billy Tyne (George Clooney) decides to travel to the faraway Flemish Cap for one last round of fishing, despite the warnings of friendly rival Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) that they will have no way of getting back without passing through the storm, Billy's pride and ego get the best of him. With the agreement of the other men on board, including Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), whose loving girlfriend, Christina (Diane Lane), waits nervously on land, they opt to ride out the storm rather than let all of the fish they have caught spoil. What they don't know, since their radio has gone out, is the full force of the storm, and that they are heading right for the eye of it.  Accurately capturing each side of the storm, and the people involved in it, there are also four subplots at hand: the dilemma of the search and rescue helicopter team; the plight of the Mistral, a yacht headed for Bermuda that is carrying three passengers (Karen Allen, Bob Gunton, Cherry Jones); the Andrea Gail's friends and family, who nailbitingly await any news on their rescue; and the meteorologist (Christopher McDonald) who first coined the phrase, ""The Perfect Storm,"" because every weather pattern was in place to create a storm of disastrous proportions.  Based on the book of the same name by Sebastian Junger, ""The Perfect Storm"" is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that is one step above most disaster pictures of its type because of the reality that is brought to it, both from a visual standpoint, as well as in its portrayal of the working-class characters. While not all are developed satisfactorily, particularly the three passengers on the Mistral, as well as suave, ladies' man Andrea Gail traveler Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne), they all are on hand to create a dark atmosphere and brooding sense of dread that hangs over the proceedings.   As head of the Andrea Gail, George Clooney is well-cast as the no-nonsense Billy Tyne, whose love of fishing outweighs all other things, including the possibility of death. Their second film in a row together (the other being 1999's ""Three Kings""), Mark Wahlberg equips himself nicely as Bobby Shatford, a young man who tells Billy at one point, ""I have a girl that I can't stand to be away from for more than ten minutes. But then again, I love to fish."" Bobby has agreed for Christina to do away with his somewhat dangerous profession after this one last trip, and the conflicting feelings that he feels is made palpable, due to Wahlberg's strong performance.   Rounding out the large cast is the always-good Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Linda Greenlaw; Diane Lane, as Christina; John C. Reilly, heartfelt and likable as Andrea Gail fisherman Dale Murphy, who is having problems handling not being able to see his young son as much since he separated from his wife; William Fichtner as bad-tempered Sully; and John Hawkes as the lonely Bugsy. As Irene, a straight-talking, yet sweet, single mother whom Bugsy strikes up a potential relationship with before he sets off on the Andrea Gale, Rusty Schwimmer is a charismatic, natural standout, and steals each of her scenes.  All human actors, however, play second banana to the star attraction of the picture, which is the robust, life-threatening storm itself, complete with downpouring rain, violent lightning, and, in a startlingly frightening climactic moment, a 100-foot tidal wave. The special effects supervisors at ILM have done a striking job bringing the storm to life, in all its horrific glory, and it is because of them that most warrants seeing it on the big screen.  ""The Perfect Storm"" isn't a great motion picture. There are too many loose story threads and one too many artificial and cliched lines of dialogue for such a title. The picture also, perhaps, takes just a little too much time getting to the storm, and fleetingly tests the patience. Once it gets going, though, it never lets up. As a purely visceral experience, ""The Perfect Storm"" is an electrifying powerhouse, undoubtedly the most exciting and rewarding action-thriller of the summer. ","Perfect Storm, The",PG,2000,2
721,"      A PERFECT WORLD is really two movies.  The main movie is a seriousone staring Kevin Costner and an 8 year old new comer named T.  J.Lowther.  The other movie is a comedy with Clint Eastwood and LauraDern.       The comedy takes up a full third of the movie, and it is awful andfull of cliches.  I am not sure how it got stuck in this picture.  Myonly guess is that they thought the picture would be too downbeatotherwise and might be criticized for glorifying criminals.  Eastwoodand Dern should have read the ridiculous script by John Lee Hancock andrefused the roles.  Since Eastwood was also the producer and director,I guess he thought knew what he was doing.       Going for it, the serious movie has two excellent performance inthe title roles.  The chemistry Costner and Lowther is quite effective.Reminds you of a Daddy and a son who love each other very much, but inthe movie the little boy is a hostage.  Going against it, is that themovie, except for the ending, does glorify criminal behavior, and itcertainly makes you feel sorry for Costner's character since he onlymurders for reasons he thinks are valid.  Interesting logic that.       Finally, why do movies always hold religion in a bad light, butnot murdering or stealing?  You are taught in this movie to despise theboy's moma (Jennifer Griffin) because their religion does not allowtrick or treating, but you are set up to applaud which he steals aHalloween costume because he deserves it.  Sigh.       A PERFECT WORLD runs 2:18 for reasons I can not fathom.  This is alittle movie and should have a brief running time.  The editor (JoelCox) must have been asleep at his desk.  The movie is rated PG-13, butI would have given it an R for its violence and adult themes.  I givethe movie ** for the two lead performances but can not bring myself torecommend the show. ","Perfect World, A",PG-13,1993,2
722," ""Permanent Midnight,"" is based on a true story about television screenwriter Jerry Stahl (Ben Stiller), who battled with his extreme heroin addiction throughout the 1970's and 80's. Told in flashback to a one night fling (Maria Bello) after he has been sober for 50 days, he talks about how the drugs pretty much destroyed him, as well as the relationship with his British wife (Elizabeth Hurley), whom he married so she would be able to get a green card.  ""Permanent Midnight,"" is a none-too-special drama that tells a story about drugs that has been done countless times before, and better. Although the sequences of the drug taking are occasionally quite graphic and realistic, that is the whole movie. There is no attempt to develop any of the other characters, and his relationship with Hurley doesn't even seem fully written. We also learn next to nothing about Stahl's career, so the film isn't even good for learning about him.   Ben Stiller cannot be faulted, however. He gives a brave, first-rate performance, and Maria Bello also is charismatic. Janeane Garofalo may very well be the highlight of the film, however, even though she is only in two scenes. There is something about her that I always love, and she brings something special or funny to every role she takes on.  ""Permanent Midnight,"" is a film filled with good performances, but very little else. It's okay to tell a story about drugs, but the filmmakers probably should have realized that constant sequences of drug taking, one after the other, does not a good film make. ",Permanent Midnight,R,1998,2
723,"If you were asked at an interview (for college, for a job, forwhatever) to name a single moment that constituted a turningpoint in your life as though you were hit by a bolt of lightning, whatwould you say?  Many of us could come up with events thatgradually changed our outlook, but this question could throw you. In ""Personal Velocity,"" Rebecca Miller, adapting her own book ofshort stories, tells of three women who have had epiphanies thatturned them around and made their lives better.  Each revelation isas different as is each woman.  Though ""Personal Velocity"" treatsmen as supporting players, this is not a chick flick.  I like to thinkof the film as an illustration of a universal principle because Ibelieve that each of us genuinely awaits this bolt of lightning thatwill set us on the right course.     The idea of revelation, then, is the common thread that unitesthe three principal players, though unlike the format of manytrilogies, the women never meet.  Delia (Kyra Sedgwick), Greta(Parker Posey), and Paula (Fairuza Balk) have problems that haveput their lives on hold and worse.  Each needs to find a way toregain a sense of empowerment (if you'll pardon the muchoverused, p.c. term).  For Delia, that empowerment would comefrom a return to a time in her life that she commanded the raptattention of men.  Greta needs to recover the ambition that gaveher a sense of purpose years ago. Paula has a boyfriend butlacks a sense of home, of fulfillment.     Rebecca Miller takes us on these three journeys, each about ahalf hour in length, showing us that while women are individuals,each as different from the other as a trio of snowflakes and drivenby a wholly personal velocity, they all need to reinvent themselveslest they become lost in life's impersonal shuffle.      Greta, the most interesting of the three perhaps because I havea soft spot for the immensely funny Parker Posey (""Best ofShow"") works for a low-end New York publishing house. Her lifechanges when a hot novelist asks her to edit his latest work, onewhich becomes a best-seller and allows Greta to be reinvigoratedboth sexually and professionally.  Her bolt of lightning comesduring a final scene with her scholarly but unexciting husband.Delia, who unlike Greta comes from a working-class background,was a devil-may-girl gal in high school, a tramp and loving her wayof life.  Leaving her abusive husband, she's as alienated by thewomen's crisis center with its patronizing social worker as she isin her family setting. She realizes what she needs suddenly whenon a date with a lecherous guy much younger than she.  Paula'sstory, the least realized of the three, deals with a womanwho maintains a strained relationship with her mother and isambivalent about her boyfriend though the latter had saved herfrom a life of the streets.  Pregnant but considering abortion, sheundergoes a sudden stroke of enlightenment after picking up a 15-year-old runaway boy.     While the performances are strong all around, with the men inthe cast supplying information that helps us to understand thethree women, the most striking thing about the picture is RebeccaMiller's script--chock full of ironic commentary and also someprescient narration by John Ventimiglia.  The fuzziness of the DVimages is compensated for by the restrained and effective use offreeze-frames that allow us in the audience to focus on someparticular high points in the lives of the women.  ""PersonalVelocity"" is a small movie, witty and funny amid its melodramaticflourishes, an intimate portrait that should make us think aboutour own life experiences with their moments of unexpectedinspiration. ",Personal Velocity,R,2002,3.5
724,"      PERSUASION is a perfect movie.  It is based on Jane Austin'sprobably least well known novel, which was published posthumously.  Ihave never read it so the story was totally fresh.  On the other hand,this movie is so good that if I had read the book a thousand times, Iwould still have left me awe struck by the acting and the production.I do hope all of the Academy members see this show.  It deserves awardsin a myriad of categories.       PERSUASION tells the story of a large number of people in severalfamilies, but at the heart it is the story of Anne Elliot (AmandaRoot).  Root is a British Shakespearean actress, and this is her firstfilm.  It is one of the most auspicious beginnings for a movie actressI can remember.  She is simply incredible.  She is an actress on theplain side of homely who transforms every scene she is in into amagical moment and yet she spends most of the movie just listening andgiving the most expressive, pensive, frequently sad, but alwayscompelling expressions I can remember.  All she need do is look intothe camera with her big dark eyes, and she owns the scene.  She saysmore by saying nothing than most actresses do with a whole movie fullof dialog.       PERSUASION is set in England in 1814 as the first Napoleonic warhas just ended.  Anne Elliot's family lives on a large estate, but haveto move out since they are broke.  Against her father's, Sir WalterElliot (Corin Redgrave), desires he agrees to rent their home to theriff raff of a navy family who are not of noble birth.       The navy family, lead by a war hero, Admiral Croft (JohnWoodvine), come and are gracious to Ann even though there is an oldsecret.  It seems that eight years earlier, a nineteen year old Ann, onthe advice of Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood), turned down a proposal ofmarriage by one of the Admiral's sons.  Ann lived in misery after that,lamenting the decision.  Lady Russell consoles her by saying that hersuitor at the time had ""no fortune, no connections.  It was entirelyprudent of you to reject him.""  The foundation of the story isunrequited love, lost opportunities, and subdued passion.  If itreminded me of any movie it was probably the unforgettable THE AGE OFINNOCENCE.       Sir Elliot and his other daughter Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls - whowas so excellent as Cordelia Flyte in ""Brideshead Revisited"") leave forBath and cheaper lodgings.  Ann leaves The Admiral and his wife (FionaShaw) to visit her cousins the Musgroves: Charles Musgrove (SimonRussell Beale), his wife (Judy Cornwell), and their sons and daughters.The Musgroves are a household of would be social climbers.  When theyhear that the Admiral's son, the famous Captain Frederick Wentworth(Ciaran Hinds), will visit then them, their life goes on hold.  Whenone of the sons inconveniently breaks his collar bone and may beparalyzed for life, they go to the welcoming party for the Captainanyway and ask Ann to nurse their son who is in shock.  The story takesnumerous twists and turns from there.       The script by Nick Dear, based on the Austin novel, is full ofmemorable lines, but the great direction by first time director RogerMitchell relies more on silence and on expressions than on the words tocarry the emotion of the tale.  The raciest lines are when Ann's cousinMr. Elliot (Samuel West) is trying to woe her.  She says, ""You presumeto know me"", and he replies, ""In my heart I know you intimately.""  Wealso have, a la THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, an extremely effective brief handholding scene.  The height of passion is reached in the show with asingle, quick kiss.  Fast it may be, the effect is total.       Besides Root's acting, which should put her on the short list foran Oscar, the performance by Hinds is almost as good.  In fact, all ofthe rest of the cast are excellent.  There is not even a mediocreperformance.       The craft of the movie itself is phenomenal.  If John Daly doesnot win an award for his cinematography then the entire Academy must beblind.  Never has candle lit scenes been more effectively and lovinglydone.  Watch the extreme length of the candle flames and how the camerashots through and around them.  Daly's technique of shooting indoorscenes closer up than normal gives an intimacy and presence that I havenot seen before.  In scenes that normally would have been filmedfurther back, like the ones of the indoor dancing, he uses handheldcameras and stays in tight on the faces and even uses panning withoutmaking the audience dizzy.  Several times he lets the camera linger ona person photographic style even when the character has no speakingparts.       The set decoration (William Dudley) and especially the costumes(Alexandra Byrne) deserve awards.  They add to the movie enormouslywithout the usual in your face period pieces that are overdone.  Thereare many fine examples of this but my favorite is the clothes andespecially the navy hat that the captain sometimes wears.  The looktells us more about his character than many pages of dialog would have.The music (Jeremy Sams) is well done with the best being the frequentuse of the harpsichord.  The make up artist is extremely talented.Watch carefully for the subtle but important changes in Ann's makeup asthe story develops.       Although there are tragedies in the movie that will take yourbreath away, the story is one mainly of carefully controlled andchecked emotions.  Finally, the movie ends as well as it begins.  Thelast line is by Ann's father.  I can not use it here as it gives away akey fact, but it is a perfect statement to his obliviousness and anexcellent end to the story.       PERSUASION runs a perfectly edited (Kate Evans) 1:43.  It is a Gmovie that is rated PG since it will probably bore kids under 8.  Thereis absolutely nothing in it to offend anyone of any age.  I moststrongly recommend this movie to you, and I give it my rarely awardedtop rating of ****. ",Persuasion,PG,1995,4
725," After the colossal box office disappointments The Rocketeer and TheShadow, one would think that Hollywood would have given up on bringingfairly obscure comic book characters to the big screen.  Alas, that isn'tthe case, but one wishes that were after seeing The Phantom, a silly,unexciting film treatment of Lee Falk's comic book hero of the same name.  Billy Zane plays Kit Walker, the latest in his family to assume themantle of the Phantom--purple-clad defender of the jungle's riches againstpirates, looters, and greed in general.  The latter is personified in oneXander Drax (Treat Williams), a wealthy business tycoon of some sort who isdetermined to find three sacred skulls which, when joined, are a source ofimmense supernatural power.  Needless to say, it's up to ""the ghost whowalks"" to prevent Drax from gaining possession of the three skulls.  Simon Wincer's (Lonesome Dove, Free Willy) film does move veryquickly and efficiently; the film opens with a concise introduction to thelegend of the Phantom that lasts little more than a minute, and he keeps theaction moving accordingly.  However, the film, for all its effects andstunts, is strangely unexciting and devoid of fun.  The action set pieces,especially the fights, look and feel scripted and staged, lacking anyspontaneous energy that would make it the slightest bit convincing; it'shard to have fun with comic book antics that are so forced and calculated.Wincer also fails to create a distinct tone; at times he appears to be goingfor a tongue-in-cheek comic book that's in on the joke and aware of itsridiculous excesses (which would have been the best choice), but at othertimes he plays it too straight, which doesn't suit a film about a guywearing purple tights who rides on horseback in the jungle in the 1930s.But it's not as if Wincer had a great script to work with.  Jeffrey Boam'sscript is little more than Batman meets Indiana Jones, or, moreappropriately, The Shadow meets Congo--by-the-numbers, predictable actionscenes involving a mysterious costumed hero in the wilds interspersed withcity scenes set against Art Deco architecture and vintage automobiles.  The performances also reflect this unevenness of tone.  Adark-haired Kristy Swanson, as the love interest, Diana Palmer, goes thestraight route and comes off stiff and out of place.  On the other side ofthe coin is Williams, who camps it up as Drax in an apparent attempt toreach the entertaining, manic heights a la Alan Rickman in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves.  Problem is, though, while Rickman chewed the scenery, hestill came off as a menacing, formidable villain; Williams just comes off asa laughable caricature.  Early on, Catherine Zeta Jones's Sala has themakings of a fun femme fatale along the lines of GoldenEye's Xenia Onatopp,but her character makes an inexplicable, abrupt change for the worse late inthe game.  The only one who achieves the appropriate balance is Zane, whonever takes himself too seriously (how could he, given that ridiculousoutfit?) while still investing a certain amount of serious conviction to therole.  Zane has an appealing, self-effacing sense of humor; he is ascredible firing guns as he is tossing off one-liners.  If only screenwriterBoam gave him more opportunities to do the latter.  One thing that did strike me about The Phantom were its connectionsto--yes--Showgirls.  Al Ruscio, who played the owner of the Stardust in thatdisastrous film, turns up as the corrupt New York police commissioner, andShowgirls costume designer Marlene Stewart came up with the duds for thispicture; also, the end credits are printed in the same typeface as those ofShowgirls.  But that's where the connections end, for the blah The Phantomis not nearly as much fun as that awful, awfully entertaining howlfest. ","Phantom, The",PG,1996,1.5
726,"      Kate Mosley was a highly creative, but relatively unsuccessfulemployee of Mercer Advertising until her friend fixed her up with afiance.  With a fiance, she is believed by her boss to be less likelyto leave town to go to work for one of his competitors and hencereliable enough to work on the big Gulden's mustard account.  Afterall,it was her idea that snagged the client in the first place.       Now she has a fiance, Kate has become attractive to the officewolf.  Kevin Bacon, with the best hair in the movie, plays a hunk knownas Sam Mayfair.  He does little apparent work and spends most of histime romancing women who are already involved.  Kate tells him that,""you're always going to be the guy at the restaurant, who, when he getswhat he ordered, decides he wants what the other guy has instead.""Commitment is Sam's greatest fear, and dangerous liaisons his primeturn-on.  He is even more handsome than Kate is beautiful so they seememinently well matched.       Thanks to Nick, her fiance, she wins both the account assignmentand Sam.  But there is a tiny problem.  Nick is a facade.  He livesonly in a picture taken almost by accident when she met him at awedding.  Their life together, immortalized in the photo of theirchance encounter, has no basis in reality.       Written by Arleen Sorkin, and Paul Slansky and Glenn Gordon Caron,the script of PICTURE PERFECT takes the typical romantic comedy formulaand puts enough spin on it to make it fresh.  The intelligent dialoghas plenty of funny one-liners, but the film's beauty revolves aroundthe effective character development of the lead.  Kate's would-belovers and her challenges at work make for an involving tapestry.  Asdirected by Glenn Gordon Caron, the director of the excellent butrelatively unknown CLEAN AND SOBER, the film focuses everything on Kateand lets her set the show's pacing.       Kate is played by Jennifer Aniston, a star of SHE'S THE ONE andthe TV series ""Friends.""  With her terrific looks, her happy andvivacious demeanor and her tenacity, Aniston gives a compellingperformance as a hyperactive career woman, while making Kate anincredibly likable character.       The show opens with a semi-shocking sequence, the upshot of whichhas Kate throwing out the guy with whom her mother had fixed her up.(Kate's mother is played with great gusto by Olympia Dukakis.)  ""I feellike I can be honest with you,"" says the guy as he is being shown thedoor.  ""You should ignore these feelings,"" she replies before she shutsthe door.       Kate's best friend, Darcy, played in a minor role by IlleanaDouglas, has been ""married since birth.""  Darcy is the one who devisesthe fake picture stratagem.  Their boss, Mr. Mercer, played with acherubic smile by Kevin Dunn, is full of advice based on his career.""You dress for the job you want, not the one you have,"" he lecturesKate as part of his explanation of why she was not chosen to be on theGulden's account.  But shortly thereafter he sees the infamous picture,and Kate's career skyrockets.       Kate at first resists, but most of the show finds her playing herfake love life for all it is worth.  Her fairy-tale boyfriend and shehave an intricate imaginary life together.  As expected, the bigcomplication comes when she is asked to produce Nick, underplayed witha big shaggy-dog look by Jay Mohr.  As anyone who has studied comedyknows, this means that Kate and/or Nick will fall in love with theother.  How that plays out makes up the last half of the film.       Toward the end the story turns bittersweet.  The inevitable scenewhere Kate tells the truth is clumsily written and delivered.  Theending itself is exactly what you would expect from a typical romanticcomedy.  One would have wished that the writers could have come up withsomething fresher.  A hard edged surprise ending would have been betterbut would probably have been dropped after the first test screening.Even if the ending is a disappointment, Kate is a fun person to hangout with for a couple of hours.       PICTURE PERFECT runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for sexualsituations and language.  The film would be fine for kids around twelveand up.  I recommend the film to you and give it ***. ",Picture Perfect,PG-13,1997,3
727,"Having written the novel for ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" (aslice-of-life about a young man responsible for taking care ofhis retarded younger brother since their obese mother had notleft the house in seven years), Peter Hedges was the idealperson to script and direct this off-beat story of a dysfunctionalfamily forced to confront one another on Thanksgiving Day. ""Pieces of April"" is in part a tale of family reconciliation,motivated in large part by the a dying mother's wish to breakbread together as an entire unit.  In part, Hedges evokes theglory of Manhattan, whose diversity of inhabitants has beenresponsible for both the sort of alienation that prevents us oftenfrom knowing our next-door neighbors, while at the sameHedges evokes a love letter to the world's most exciting city.     The writer-director's photographer, Tami Reiker, trains herlenses on disparate scenes during the sixteen-day shoot.  Onesegment focuses on the tenants in a Lower East Sidedilapidated building (on the ironically named Suffolk Street),whose twenty-something April Burns (Katie Holmes) shares atiny apartment with her boy friend, Bobby (Derek Luke).  Theother catches the young woman's family in their station wagon;Joy Burns (Patricia Clarkson) and Jim Burns (Oliver Platt), hertwo younger sibs Timmy (John Gallagher Jr.) and Beth (AlisonPill), and her senile grandmother, appropriately named Dottie(Alice Drummond).  As Hedges shifts from the nabe to thewagon and back again, we watch the big Thanksgiving Dayreunion takes root.        New Yorkers may well relate more to the progress of April'smeetings with her neighbors than to the evolution of theapproaching family get-together.  In a building that could be amicrocosm fo the Big Apple, April is pushed by a breakdown inher oven to knock on the doors of fellow tenants whom she hadnever met.  Looking to lease a gas range for a few hours on thatfateful day, she encounters, in turn, a black couple who wonderjust what sort of a problem could possibly be faced by a ""young,privileged white woman with the rest of her life to look forwardto;"" a Chinese family who do not speak English; an introverteddandy who allows her to use his brand new convection unit butwith a price; a vegan with posters of her politics tacked to herdoor; and  one of two guys who slam the door in her face.       The dramatic tensions of the suburban segment of the Burnsfamily are not as compelling.  Jim must remind his teens thatthough they may not like the idea of visiting their older sister,this could be their cancer-ridden mother's last chance to enjoythe holiday as a whole family unit.  For her part, Joy (alsoironically named at least until the concluding scenes) is bitter. Her illness has turned her personality around to such an extentthat the woman's dotty mother no longer recognizes her (ifindeed she did at any point during her senescence).       Despite the brief length of the film, two scenes do not workand seem almost part of another movie.  In one, Bobby takes offto leave his girlfriend to her cooking, meeting up with a friend,Latrell (Sisqo), who fits him out with a suit from a SalvationArmy store.  The other involves Bobby, scooting his way homeand running into Tyrone (a white guy formerly called Eddie),who berates him for stealing his girl.     On the whole, ""Pieces of April,"" a heartfelt story full of laughs,intrigue, regrets and memories, makes for an impressive billet-doux to both family life and to the unexpected pleasures of livingin a tenement building chock full of eccentric but mostly friendlyand generous neighbors.   ",Pieces Of April,PG-13,2003,3
728,"""The Pink Panther"" is a light comedy, with strong romantic,fashion, and slapstick elements.  While some scenes arefunny, as a whole the film doesn't quite come off.There are problems with casting and characters and dialogue,and overall shallowness.  David Niven stars as a man leading a double life: suaveplayboy Sir Charles and a jewel thief known as 'The Phantom'.His conquests include two women half his age, Simone (Capucine)and Princess Dala (Claudia Cardinale).  Both these womenhave apparently been cast for their looks and their accents.Simone is also the wife of police detective Inspector Clouseau(Peter Sellers) a bumbling fool who is hot on the trail ofThe Phantom.  Much of the film takes place in a hotel bedroom, with Sellersattempting to seduce his wife, who must gently parry hisunwanted advances while keeping him in the dark about Niven'sdouble identity.  To make her job even more difficult,Robert Wagner shows up as Niven's nephew, with his uncle'spersonality traits of smugness, seduction and thievery.Capucine must tease and mislead him as well, but as he ismore sharp than Sellers, matters begin to unravel.  Sellers, of course, plays Inspecter Clouseau well, butnot all of his gags are funny, such as when he burnshis hand.  ""The Pink Panther"" is notable for introducing the Clouseaucharacter, which Sellers played in a series of sequelsuntil his untimely death.  The later films are centeredaround Clouseau and not the criminals that he is ineptlychasing.  The film was nominated for one Academy Award, for HenryMancini's inspired jazz score.  While the title refersto a 'priceless' jewel, it has become associated withthe score and the cartoon panther character, who showsup in the opening and closing credits.  The Pink Pantherlater became the star of a cartoon show, and for a whileeven had his own breakfast cereal (it was really gross:it made the milk turn pink).  Sadly, the Pink Panther hassince been relegated to commercials for Owens Fiberglass. ","Pink Panther, The",NR,1964,
729,"         ""You damn dirty apes!"" That's just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from PLANET OF THE APES that's taken on a comedic context over time. No one back then seemed to realize how over-the-top Charlton Heston's acting style was, but it shows now, particularly in this ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time, actually winning one Oscar (for makeup, no less) and being nominated for a couple others. It also spawned multiple sequels like Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape From the Planet of the Apes, Return of the Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Escape from the Return of the Planet of the Apes, Planet of the Apes: The Next Generation, Police Academy of the Apes... the list goes on.          Heston is an American astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from Earth. The thing is, on this planet humans can't talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species. Heston's companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned. He surprises them all with his gift of speech, making two primate scientists (Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter) believe Heston is the missing link between ape and man. Believe me, we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years.          When the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel (the head ape being Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans), it is received as heresy, for all good monkeys know God ""created ape in His image."" But Heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species, before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president. And he takes them there, holding up a baby doll and yelling, ""If humans couldn't speak, then how do you account for this TALKING DOLL?!"" And how do you account for your acting ability, Mr. Heston?          The absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie's surprise conclusion. I won't reveal the details except to say it involves Heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling ""God damn you all to hell!"" several times in succession. The movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them.          What makes PLANET OF THE APES even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony, a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution. But let me tell you, if Darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges (HESTON [to female ape]: May I kiss you before I go?  APE: But... you're so... ugly.), he'd convert to creationismon the spot. Luckily for us, science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good. ",Planet of the Apes,G,1968,2
730,"The end of Cold War deprived the world of the movies featuring rugged individuals who save free people from Red Menace. All those nostalgic for those good old times could find traces of Hollywood's Cold War in the plot of PLATO'S RUN, 1997 action film directed by James Becket.  Protagonist of the film is Plato Smith (played by Gary Busey), mine expert, former Navy SEAL and former CIA covert operative. After the end of Cold War he is utterly bored and spends all of its time hanging out with equally bored Cold War veterans in South Florida. Lack of money and persuasive powers of his former flame Marta (played by Tiani Warden) are reasons why he agrees to conduct covert operation for Gomez (played by Salvador Levy), powerful Cuban American. Gomez' son has been rotting in Castro's prison so Plato goes to Cuba to rescue him. But when it turns out that ""son"" was actually an assassin hired to kill Gomez, all hell breaks lose. Plato is set up for murder and must hide himself not only from police and vengeful Gomez's men, but also from Alexander Senarkian (played by Roy Scheider), menacing arms dealer.  Plot about old, fat, unfit and bored Cold War veterans having to show their deadly skills one more time had more potential than this B-film finally delivered. More ambitious director could have turned PLATO'S RUN into modern anti-western in the style of THE SHOOTIST or simply treat the realm of Cold War action films as an excellent source of parody material. Writer and director James Becket failed to see such potential and turned PLATO'S RUN into just another cheap and uninspired action film with predictable plot and mostly bored actors. Roy Scheider is terrible to watch in the role of cartoonish villain, while Steven Bauer fails to provide comic relief as Plato's friend and associate Sam. On the other hand, the film has few lucid and funny moments, especially those involving Gary Busey, but there aren't enough of them to make this film into anything better than barely watchable. ",Plato's Run,R,1998,1
731," ""Playing by Heart"" is an always-entertaining and fairly thoughtful film on the subject of love, and how everyone hopes for it in one way or another. Obviously borrowing the structure of a Robert Altman film, such as 1975's incomparable classic ""Nashville"" and 1993's ""Short Cuts,"" ""Playing by Heart"" does not reach the overall ambitiousness of those two pictures, but is nicely done all the same.  In Altmanesque fashion, ""Playing by Heart"" introduces us to various people one at a time living in L.A. and, switching back and forth between them, their personal stories begin to play out. Inevitably, these seemingly unconnected characters will somehow come together during the climax, and also not surprising is that the several stories vary in quality.  By far the most effective and involving, and thankfully the one that is given the most screen time, involves Joan (Angelina Jolie), a talkative, witty college student who, one night, meets Keenan (Ryan Phillippe), a good-looking and quiet clubhopper. Although she strikes up a conversation with him, and thus begins to pursue him, he blatantly states to her that he doesn't date, even though he obviously likes her very much as well. Heartfelt and realistic, this section of the picture is also helped considerably by the wonderful performances from the effervescent Jolie, who definately has ""rising star"" written across her forehead, and Phillippe, who gives his best performance to date. Whenever these two wholly original characters appeared on the screen, things would suddenly brighten up a notch, and I always looked forward to seeing them in their next scene.  Also highly moving, if not given quite as much time as I would have liked, concerns Mildred (Ellen Burstyn), who opts to stay with her son, Mark (Jay Mohr), in the hospital where he is dying from AIDS. Gradually, several truths are let out in the open between mother and son, and the sequences between them were handled very well by the performers, particularly Burstyn, who has a heartbreaking scene towards the end where she holds her ailing grown child for the last time.   Third on the success meter, and also intelligently written and often funny, deals with lonely, but scared, thirtysomething Meredith (Gillian Anderson), a theatrical director who is afraid to get involved in a romantic relationship, even when she meets the ""too-good-to-be-true"" Trent (Jon Stewart). With this film, Anderson was so affirmed and believable in her character that I did not think of ""The X-Files,"" in which she stars, once. Stewart also proves he is definately someone to watch, a comedian who in the last two months has had two dramatic feature roles, the other being as a threatening science teacher in ""The Faculty."" Adding a great deal of comedic support to this story, as well, must go to Meredith's huge dog who, in one amusing sequence, jumps up on Trent revealing that he is as big as a grown man. ""Suddenly, I am feeling a bit inadequate,"" Trent slyly quips.  In the fourth plotline, Dennis Quaid stars as Hugh, a man who, night after night, drifts from bar to bar making up elaborate fictional stories about his wife and children to tell to women (including Patricia Clarkson and Natassja Kinski). Although slight, a few interesting moments arise, including one scene where, at the end of his ropes, he goes to a gay bar posing as a homosexual and lets out his feelings to an understanding transsexual.   Out of all of the characters, the two matriarchs are Hannah (Gena Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery), a married couple about to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary, coming to terms with Paul's recently discovered brain tumor and questions of his fidelity twenty-five years before. I was never really able to get involved in this particular story, even though, once again, many brightly written moments were able to seap through now and again, including an on-going joke about how Paul is always foolishly giving away the endings of movies Hannah happens to be watching on television. Rowlands is one of the biggest talents among her elder peers, and she is able to bring a great deal of humanity to her underwritten role. Likewise for Connery, who has made his first serious film in a long time (I'm sure he would like to forget that ""The Avengers"" ever happened).  Among all of these alternating characters, the only story that is a total waste, has to do with Gracie (Madeleine Stowe), a 40-ish woman who constantly is meeting a man (Anthony Edwards) at a hotel and indulging in a strictly sexual relationship, despite both of them being married. Luckily, this story only very sporadically appears, so it doesn't really affect the film as a whole even though I am not quite sure why it wasn't just completely scrapped. Stowe can be a wonderful actress, and is saved from being all-in-all wasted due to an earnest, somewhat-redeeming scene during the epilogue, in which all eleven main characters are revealed to be somehow interconnected (although I will not dare give away the exact details).  Even with its occasionally uneven structure, ""Playing by Heart"" ultimately turned out to in no way be a disappointment because when the film was good, it absolutely sparkled, thanks to the fast and quirky dialogue and the mature way in which the characters were handled. The Joan and Keenan story, especially, was good enough that an entire film could have easily just been about those two. In the first scene, Joan reminisces about a man she once knew who told her, ""talking about love is like dancing about architecture."" Tellingly, ""Dancing about Architecture"" was the original title of ""Playing by Heart,"" but the line remains to stand for a lot about the way we, as human beings, all naturally yearn to love and be loved, even during its unavoidable ups and downs.  ",Playing By Heart,R,1999,2.5
732,"Few films have been so thoroughly and universally trashed bythe critics as PAYBACK, 1999 crime thriller by BrianHelgeland. Most of them attacked the overuse of violence andutter lack of any moral compass among its characters. Theauthor of this review agrees with most of the critics, butonly partially. The filmmakers had it coming, but forentirely different reasons. The biggest crime made by makersof PAYBACK lies in the fact that they had dared to remakePOINT BLANK, 1967 film by John Boorman. That film happenedto be one of the best underrated film classics of all times,and its reputation really shouldn't have been tarnished byuninspired and tedious remake.  The plot of the original film is based on THE HUNTER, 1964novel by Donald E. Westlake. Its protagonist (played by LeeMarvin) is known only by the name Walker. His best friendMal Reese (played by John Vernon) is a gangster owing hugedebt to all-powerful Organisation. In order to save hisfriend's life, Walker agrees to take part in a robbery thatwould pay Reese's debt. But, instead of gratitude, Walkerreceives two bullets by Reese, who then takes off withWalker's adulterous wife Lynne (played by Sharon Acker) andWalker's 93,000 US$ share of the loot. Walker was left fordead, but he managed to survive and a year later he isapproached by some creepy individual named Yost (played byKeenan Wynn). Yost offers information about Lynne and Reesein exchange for Walker's help with his own plans aboutOrganisation. Walker agrees and begins the violent campaignto take revenge and retrieve his money.  One of the reasons why POINT BLANK was somewhat shadowed byother films of 1960s lies in the fact that it was probablymade at least a decade before its time. Dark, nihilisticscript by Alexander Jacobs, David and Rafe Newhouse, as wellas extremely violent, amoral and emotionally damagedprotagonists belong more to the 1970s than to idealistic1960s. However, most critics and viewers probably failed tosee the real element of the originality in POINT BLANK. Thereason why this film should enter all film encyclopaediaslies in the original directorial approach and very distinctvisual style employed by its director John Boorman. Rathersimplistic plot and even simpler characters are enhanced bythe heavy atmosphere and use of tricks today mostlyassociated with ""artsy"" films or music videos - slow motion,repetitive flashbacks, fast editing and, above all, veryhaunting soundtrack by Stephen Edwards. POINT BLANKtherefore looks very different from most of the crimethrillers. Another thing that makes it very distinct is arather original perspective on the criminal underworld -people who inhabit such realms are well- dressed,well-educated, they live in luxurious, modern, stylishapartments and houses and, generally speaking, and insteadof looking like the pariahs of the society, they look likeits pillars. In that regard, by presenting criminals likemodern-day aristocracy and criminal organisations asequivalent of all-powerful state POINT BLANK would resemblesome crime thrillers of the latter decades.  Heavy atmosphere and style of POINT BLANK compensated thesimplicity of the script, but Boorman, unfortunately,overplayed that card. In some instances the events on thescreen are unclear, characters act irrationally and filmeven lacks the proper closure, leaving the audience withoutexpected catharsis. Boorman even makes more confusion withsome surreal shots, hinting that the whole film could benothing more than a fantasy of a dying Walker. On the otherhand, the viewers are still focused thanks to excellentcast. Lee Marvin played wonderful and complex role of aseemingly simple character - at first he is man in love,faithful friend, and later he turns into extremely violentyet stone-cold killer whose motivations shift, but hisdetermination does not. His acting is very subtle, and theemotional states of Walker are presented through smallgestures, short glances or cold, impersonal action. Hemanaged to overshadow everyone else, including veryenergetic Angie Dickinson as his accidental partner.Overshadowed by the lead or not, supporting cast is splendid- John Vernon played the first of his many villainous roles,James Sikking is great as cynical hitman, as well as LloydBochner and Carroll O'Connor as corporate gangsters. SharonAcker as his wife appears relatively shortly, but her roleis also memorable, especially during her final monologuethat expresses the emotional emptiness of her character.  POINT BLANK perhaps earned its reputation simply by beingshot in the right time, but it could provide goodinspiration to future film- makers. With better results thanthe last time, we should all hope. ",Point Blank,NR,1967,3

I'm here to report that,like the Energizer bunny, Pok_mon just keeps on going and going.  Like theendless stream of Power Rangers fans, a new batch of young kids keeps comingalong to discover the joys of ""pocket monsters.""  Both series are colorful andcareful never to tax the cognitive powers of young minds.  Adults play endlessgames of solitaire on the computer, and teens devote countless hours to killingvideo game monsters, so why can't the little ones have their own mindlessactivities?  All of the above notwithstanding, I hate having to spend timeviewing Pok_mon on the big screen or on the little one, but, to be fair, theseries is made for people whose ages are in the low to mid single digits, a timethat has long since passed me by.  The plot in POKÄMON 4EVER has the heroes, Ash Ketchum (voiced by VeronicaTaylor), his buddies Misty (voiced by Rachael Lillis) and Brock (voiced by EricStuart), and their candy-colored companion Pikachu (voiced by Ikue Ootani),fighting villains bent on world domination.  This villainous organization iscalled SPECTRE -- oops, wrong movie -- I mean, Team Rocket.  Will Ash andfriends prevail?  What do you think?

734,"In this year's summer movie preview issue of _Entertainment_Weekly_,Theresa Connelly described her writing-directing debut, _Polish_Wedding_,as ""a child that did not quite become the child I thought it would.""  Onewonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film, acomedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements.  The family at the center of _Polish_Wedding_ is the Pzoniaks, whichconsists of mother Jadzia (Lena Olin), father Bolek (Gabriel Byrne), soledaughter Hala (Claire Danes) and four sons of varying degrees offacelessness.  It's a large family, but there's not a sympathetic one inthe whole bunch, certainly not in the primary trio.  Jadzia takes pride inbuilding and maintaining a home and family, but she's kind of a hypocritesince she's carrying on an affair with a businessman Rade Serbedzija).  Herexcuse for her affair is neglect from Bolek, who is such a passive wimpthat one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration.  Also, how couldhe possibly pay so little attention to the saucy, sexy Jadzia?  Hala is aspoiled, self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexualexperimentation predictably leads to pregnancy.  With such an unappealing set of characters, it's no surprise that_Polish_Wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving.  Naturally,Jadzia and Bolek would like Hala to marry the young cop, Russell Schuster(Adam Trese), who fathered the child, but he refuses to make such acommitment.  Ho-hum.  Another complication, involving the decidedlyun-virginal Hala being selected to crown a statue of the Virgin Mary, isfirst played for laughs and then, inexplicably, as a Profound Statement inthe film's climax--which, ironically, is funnier than any of the film'slame attempts at humor, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt whereJadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up Russell.  That scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by Connelly.  TheJadzia-Bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar tositcom viewers.  The Hala-Russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived amanner, but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if theyhad missed something.  And then there's some atrocious dialogue, which I amsure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound: ""Look at all thesepickles.  Just looking at them gives me such great sadness.""  As misguided as _Polish_Wedding_ is, the affair is something of a letdown,considering the strong performances by Byrne, Danes, and especially thefiery Olin.  They obviously believed in Connelly and her material--a faiththat audiences will be hard-pressed to share. ",Polish Wedding,PG-13,1998,1
735,"You can say this much for POOTIE TANG, written and directed by Louis C.K.,it isn't pretentious.  Pootie Tang (Lance Crouther) is a crime fighterrather in the spirit of AUSTIN POWERS but with an extra dose of sillinessand set in a black ghetto rather than in swinging London.  The jokes, whilealways outrageous, are rarely funny.  Its humor tires not too long after thebeginning credits have finished rolling. Typical of the level of the comedy is the way that Pootie's father, known asDaddy Tang (Chris Rock), dies.  Daddy Tang, we are told, is ""only"" the thirdemployee to have been mauled to death by a gorilla at the steel mill wherehe works. About the only funny bit occurs when Dirty D. (Reg E. Cathey) arrives on thescene.  Driving a big Cadillac that looks like it has just been through amud storm, Dirty D. is exactly like his name, right now to a fur coatcovered in dirt.  When he raises his arms, dust fills the air like the fogrolling in off the ocean.  He's a bad dude, but no match for superheroPootie Tang, who can dodge a hail of bullets with his dance-likeundulations. Like a biography, we flashback to see Pootie when he was a 6-year-old boy.Swaggering through the neighborhood in his fur coat, leather pants andsunglasses, he attracts the local women like flies to honey, even if they'rea couple of decades older. Much of the movie concerns Pootie's war with the evil Dick Lecter (RobertVaughn) who runs a large conglomerate.  When Pootie's PSAs (Public ServiceAnnouncements) encouraging healthy lifestyles cause the sales of LecterBurgers, Lecter Cigarettes and Lecter Whiskey to plummet, the battle begins.By this time, however, you will have long since lost any interest in themovie. POOTIE TANG runs 1:20.  It is rated PG-13 for sex-related material, languageand drug content and would be acceptable for teenagers.",Pootie Tang,PG-13,2001,1
736,"         The crown jewel of 1970's Irwin Allen disaster movies, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE features an all-star cast including Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship. The story begins on the U.S.S. Poseidon's big New Year's cruise, where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive.          Let's see, there's the New Age preacher (Hackman) who advises people to ""pray to that part of God within yourself."" There's the ex-cop (Borgnine) who busted a hooker (Stella Stevens) six times -- then married her. There's the hippie singer (""There's got to be a morning after..."") who turns to the company of a lonely man (Red Buttons) once her brother is killed. And to round out the group: the elderly couple (Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters) who live aboard the ship, the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous Scotsman Roddy McDowall.          We get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, before straight-faced ship captain Leslie Nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship. Everyone's in the giant ballroom at the time, shortly past midnight of the new year, when the ship turns first on its side, then completely upside down. The second-in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives, but rebel Hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship.          In this case, because the ship is overturned, the top is the bottom. Or is the bottom the top? Either way, we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- Christmas trees. Thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors, through burning rooms, etc. while the ship slowly fills with water behind them.          It's a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE works more as a Bad Movie To Laugh At, with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes. The one note in Borgnine's one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with Hackman every step of the way while Buttons and the hippie fall in love (although since there isn't a sex scene, we never find out if his buttons really are Red) and Albertson and Winters wonder if they'll live to see their grandson's birth.          Shelley Winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end, where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and Hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along. Winters, who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie (Stevens even not-so-affectionately calls her ""fatass"" in one scene), finally finds her purpose. ""I was the underwater swimming champ of New York three years running when I was seventeen,"" she brags, and before Hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years, she's swimming through the water, her skirt billowing up around her hips, showing off her cellulite (or do you call it Shellulite?) ridden thighs. It's not so much funny as innately disgusting, which pretty much sums up THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE as a whole. ","Poseidon Adventure, The",PG,1972,1.5
737,"Is it just me or are you also getting really tired of opportunisticstudios turning their television cartoons into mediocre movies withno ideas behind them other than stretching out the length?  Last week,Nickelodeon brought us the lifeless HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE, and, thisweek, the Cartoon Network brings us the almost as lame THE POWERPUFFGIRLS MOVIE.  Kids' movies don't have to be so unimaginative, butforgoing the need for much of a plot or script is an easy way to quickprofits.  Our kids deserve much better, and some studios, Disney inparticular, take great pains to supply quality products. The story's AWOL plot has the Powerpuff Girls, Blossom (voiced byCatherine Cavadini), Bubbles (voiced by Tara Charendoff) and Buttercup(voiced by E.G. Daily), first destroying a city and then saving it. In a rambunctious game of tag, the girls, who can fly and run likebullets, tear up streets and knock down buildings.  When the cameraspull back, the town has been reduced to rubble.  After the city miraculouslyself-repairs, the girls fight and defeat a villain named Mojo Jojo(voiced by Roger L. Jackson) who threatens the city.  That's it for the plot. While computer drawn animation keeps improving, the bar for the acceptablelevel of traditional animation is constantly being lowered.  THE POWERPUFFGIRLS MOVIE has one of the cheapest looks in recent memory.  Drawnwith simple rectangles and circles and with sparing use of color,the movie has something less than a 2D appearance.  Although thismight be acceptable on a free television show, you have the rightto expect something better when you're paying close to ten dollars a ticket. ""Wake up and seize the town!"" Mojo Jojo tells his cohorts in crime. You'll be telling yourself that a lot during the movie, at leastthe ""Wake up!"" part.  If your kids like the series, they'll probablylike the movie too, but I'll let you in on a money-saving secret. If you tape three episodes of ""The Powerpuff Girls"" and show it tothem, they'll enjoy it just as much, and you'll have saved the fiftybucks that you would have spent on tickets and refreshments. THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE runs 1:20.  It is rated PG for ""non-stopfrenetic animated action"" and would be acceptable for all ages. My son Jeffrey and his friend Nickolas, both 13, thought the moviewas cute and had some funny parts.  Jeffrey gave it **, and Nickolasgave it ** 1/2.  Jeffrey's cousins, William and Liana, ages 8 and 5, really liked it.  ","Powerpuff Girls Movie, The",PG,2002,1.5
738," Dabbling is dangerous.  Sally and Gillian Owens, played charmingly bySandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, were trained as witches when they wereyoung, but they've never been serious practitioners.  When their loversstart dying on them, they turn to the book of magic for help withdisastrous results.  Director Griffin Dunne's PRACTICAL MAGIC, which isn't as whimsical asthe material warrants, starts during the time of the Salem witch trialsas an Owens woman is being hung.  She escapes that ordeal, but then herlover abandons her while she is carrying his child.  In retaliation, sheputs a curse on any man who ever dares to love an Owens woman again, andit works forever after.  The film, which has a long series of missed opportunities, starts slowlyand has trouble building any sustainable momentum.  When Dunne brings ina few significant doses of the supernatural in the last part, the moviefinally begins to find its legs.  Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing play Aunt Jet and Aunt Frances, thequirky relatives who raised Sally and Gillian.  The parts of the auntsare the least well developed in the generally unpolished script by RobinSwicord, based on Alice Hoffman's novel.  Sally and Gillian are as different as sisters can be while still boundby love and witchcraft.  Sally is happily domestic.  She lives on apicture-book island and has a handsome husband and two delightful girls.Gillian, in contrast, has a string of lovers and lives life totally onthe wild side.  She describes her current and abusive boyfriend as avampire-cowboy type.  Aidan Quinn steals the picture as an out of state detectiveinvestigating some mysterious activities.  His likable characterprovides a good-hearted spark that enlivens the film's second half.  Aromantic angle with him and one of the sisters is less satisfying.  Asin the rest of the movie, the director sets up the romance but keepspulling it back, never quite letting it ignite as it should.  The story works best when it unabashedly follows its offbeat roots.  Thespoon in Sally's cup keeps on stirring, for example, whether her hand ison the spoon or not.  More of these cute little touches would havehelped, as would more of the film's black comedy aspects.  As delivered,the film moves in fits and spurts, never quite taking off, yet providingsome bits of solid entertainment along the way.  The movie does suggest some fascinating possibilities for the parentcalling chain at school.  But the PTA would most certainly not approve.  PRACTICAL MAGIC runs 1:43.  It is rated PG-13 for mild profanity,violence and sensuality and would be fine for kids around 10 and up. ",Practical Magic,PG-13,1998,2
739,"Known as the most successful, highest-grossing romantic comedy in history, director Garry Marshall apparently struck gold with ""Pretty Woman,"" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but, thanks to positive word-of-mouth, was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone. The question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars, Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, since the story itself is none too original or even believable. The other winning element that makes ""Pretty Woman"" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence, which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here.   Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) is a suave, extremely wealthy business mogul who, at the start of the picture, breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument, and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on Hollywood Boulevard while trying to find his hotel. Stopping the car along the street, he asks a woman, obviously a prostitute, for directions. Agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks, Edward ultimately accepts, they strike up a conversation, and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor. This meeting does not lead to sex, however, as Edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to, and offers her $300 to spend the night. Just as well, since the hooker, named Vivian, is a beautiful, generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear. The meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned, when Edward finally offers to pay Vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area, keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers. Since Vivian firmly tells Edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips, which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers, the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act, Edward and Vivian will finally, truly, kiss.  Allegedly planned as a grim, downbeat drama until Garry Marshall came on board as director, ""Pretty Woman"" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale, a la ""Cinderella."" The premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of Hollywood Boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been. You honestly don't need a high-IQ (or any IQ, for that matter) to guess how the film will end, and the story is as old as my Great Great Grandma Bertha. The supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying, and the screenplay is no award winner. And yet, amidst all of these qualms and flaws, ""Pretty Woman"" is an astoundingly charming motion picture, and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers. You'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go, and there are a few select moments (not even whole scenes, mind you) that are as romantic as anything I've seen on film in the 1990's.  Additionally, the film belongs, and its success can be attributed, to two people and two people only, and they are Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as ""American Gigolo"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" Gere branches out here to play a more quiet, almost shy, but still alluring, character that believably could sweep Julia Roberts off her feet, and vice versa. Julia Roberts, in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received ""Mistic Pizza"" and 1989's ""Steel Magnolia,"" for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, is radiant and funny as the wordly Vivian, who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers, not for her line of work, but more for her sheer intelligence. It would have probably been easy to have written Vivian as merely a flake, but screenwriter J.F. Lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing. After ""Pretty Woman,"" Roberts, along with Meg Ryan, became the reigning queen of romantic comedies (with her latest being the just-released ""Runaway Bride,"" which repairs Gere and Roberts together once again), and no wonder. Roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy, but also one who can efficiently do drama, and in almost every film she appears in, it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star.   An especially strong scene that Gere and Roberts do together takes place after Edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that Vivian is actually a prostitute, and he then approaches her, making sexual advances. No only does this make Vivian feel cheap, especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional, eloquent young lady, but it also maddens her that Edward would demean and betray her in such a way, and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading, and if she likes this particular path. On the more dreamy side, the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold, especially one in which Edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see Vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress, but also her inner (and outer) glowing beauty. Another subtle moment has Vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to Edward, who is asleep, and placing it on his lips, since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days.  ""Pretty Woman"" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene, which is a happy ending (as you'd expect, and wouldn't have it any other way) that somehow does not work, perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances. This one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film, though, because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem. Helped along by a warm, memorable supporting performance from Laura San Giacomo, as Vivian's best friend and roommate, and a fabulously catchy soundtrack, in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment, ""Pretty Woman"" is a sparkler of a motion picture, and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy. ",Pretty Woman,R,1990,3.5
740,"      Most viewers probably suspected that PRIMARY COLORS from THEBIRDCAGE's collaborative team of director Mike Nichols and writerElaine May would be a funny comedy, although many may have feared,incorrectly, that it would wallow in caricature and cheap shots.  Whatis so surprising about what has turned out to be the best new moviereleased thus far this year is that it is so much more that merelyfunny.  Nichols and May have produced a veritable laugh riot thatmanages to move seamlessly from comedy to tragedy to social commentaryand back again.  An adroit movie that can turn on a dime, it mesmerizesits audiences in the same way that its fictional governor wins thehearts and minds of his audiences.       After the 1992 campaign columnist, Joe Klein, writing under thepseudonym ""Anonymous,"" turned his observations and research into anovel by changing the characters' names and transforming some of theincidents.  Given the subsequent scandals, especially the current ones,the movie borders on being almost frighteningly relevant.       Starting with close-ups of Clinton -- oops, I did it already -- Imean Southern governor Jack Stanton shaking hands, we learn the subtlemeanings of his various handshakes.  (And, if the explanations arecorrect, then when the real life Clinton shook my hand during thecampaign, I got a grade C handshake that meant nothing.)       As Governor Stanton, a beefed up John Travolta gives a creepilyaccurate portrayal.  When he feels people's pains on the campaigntrail, he usually spins some story from his childhood that the crowdcan identify with.  That the stories contain at best only a grain oftruth doesn't lessen his belief in them or their effect on the citizenslistening.  He's one of them, and they like him.       From the beginning we learn that Jack likes all of hisconstituents, especially the pretty, young females.  And his aideshappily look the other way when he beds one early on in the picture.       As his wife, Susan, Emma Thompson gives an equally superlativeperformance.  The Stantons' apparently dysfunctional marriage isactually highly functional since both share a single-minded desire toget to the top.  If that means Susan has to yell, curse like a sailorand throw things at Jack in front of the help, well, so be it.  Jack,for his part, never seems to mind.  It's the price he's used to payingfor a life of licentiousness.  ""The only shot we have here is to beperfect,"" Susan lectures him when he is late as usual.  The irony isthat they have no hope of attaining perfection, but they are both suchsuperlative political operatives that neither needs it.       Amidst all the hullabaloo of the campaign are quieter moments ofdelicate power.  In the George Stephanopoulos part, Adrian Lester playsHenry Burton, the son of a famous civil rights leader, who wants tochange the world.  He sees Jack as his ticket to where real power lies,but he's worried that he's selling his soul when he's asked to join theStanton entourage as a key aide.  At one point the sleaze overwhelmsHenry, and he's forced to stop the car so he can throw up.       When Henry goes to set up his first campaign headquarters, theclueless crowd just stares at him when he asks if anyone has anyskills.  Finally, one guy breaks the silence to allow as how he speaksHebrew.       In easily the best performance in the picture, SLING BLADE's BillyBob Thornton plays the role of firebrand, redneck Richard Jemmons,modeled after James Carville.  Billy Bob manages to make the frequentlyobnoxious Carville into a likable, albeit outrageous, politicaloperative par excellence.  Richard, like his boss, does have hisfoibles, seen, for example, when he exposes himself to fellow campaignworker, Jennifer Rogers, played by Stacy Edwards from IN THE COMPANY OFMEN.  One hopes members of the Academy will remember Billy Bob'sperformance when it comes time next year to vote for supporting actors.       The picture is so funny at times that you may have troublecontrolling yourself, Jack and Richard's ""mamathon"" being one of therib-ticklingest.  Susan explains that when a couple of southern boysget together and start swapping stories about their mamas, they may goon forever.  And in another scene, in which a cocky son of one ofJack's opponents apologizes to Susan with a ""Hope you don't mind if wetalk business?"" she cattily assures him it's okay to discuss politicswith her husband in front of her.  ""How else can I learn?"" replies theultra-savvy woman with beautifully fake naivete.       Nichols has a gift for staging physical comedy.  When Jack loseshis temper, he throws the cell phone out the window.  This causes Jackand Susan to go searching through the bushes when they realize theyneed it after all.  Almost like sparring boxers, Nichols and May seemto try to outdo each other in their collaboration.  May, for example,comes up with a wonderfully complicated conundrum for Richard.  Heintroduces a folksy tale about defecating in the woods while wild bearsattack that has everyone around the table interpreting his metaphorsdifferently.  Almost all of Richard's hilarious lines in the movie areunprintable although one particular astute one isn't.  ""That's whatthese guys do,"" he says of the transient loyalty of politicians likehis boss.  ""They love you and then stop lovin' you.""       In another wonderful piece of work, Kathy Bates is a tough lesbiannamed Libby Holden, who puts out scandals in general and bimboeruptions in particular.  ""From now on you can call me the 'DustBuster,'"" Libby explains her role.  ""I'm stronger than dirt.""       Larry Hagman, as Gov. Fred Picker, one of Jack's opponents, givesthe best performance of his career.  If you've ever had doubts aboutthe depth of his acting abilities, wait until his last scene, which isstunning.       ""I'm going to tell you something really outrageous,"" Jack tells agroup of blue-collar workers.  ""I'm going to tell you the truth.""  In acareer in which his veracity always remains subservient to winning,this could indeed be considered outrageous.       Since the movie is just a time slice from a long campaign,choosing how to end it is tricky.  The choice they made involvessetting before the Stantons a moral test that serves as kind of ametaphor for the Stantons' political careers.  Like the ending of theTITANIC, the outcome of their moral test is never really in question.       PRIMARY COLORS runs 2:20 but feels much shorter.  It is rated Rfor profanity and sexual references and would be fine for teenagers. ",Primary Colors,R,1998,3.5
741,"""The Prince & Me"" makes no bones about the fact that it is a formulaicromantic fantasy, but it is still deceptive. For the first 90 minutesof its running time, the characters and situations were more or lessbased in reality, with the subj ect of a farm girl swept off her feetby a royal prince as plausibly handled as one could possibly expect.And then comes a climax that, in a key sequence set before a crowdof Denmark onlookers, strains the boundaries of one's suspension ofdisbelief. Still, this moment was hardly calamitous to the entireproduct. Unfortunately, it is followed by an enraging final scenethat not only has a clumsy, tacked-on feel, as if test screening audiencesgot ahold of it in their narrow pursuit of a neat-and-tidy conclusion,but also goes against everything our heroine was set up to believein. In this fleeting last second, ""The Prince & Me"" was convertedfrom an amiable enough light entertainment into an unforgivably condescendingwaste of time. Paige Morgan (Julia Stiles) is a studious pre-med student enteringher final undergraduate year at a Wisconsin university. As she seesall of her old high school friends finally getting engaged and married,Paige has a difficult time understandi ng their intentions.

What Paige doesn't yetknow is that Eddie's full name is Edvard Valdemaar Dangaard, and heis the distinguished Prince of Denmark. Directed by Martha Coolidge (1983's ""Valley Girl""), ""The Prince &Me"" takes a detour in the second half, bringing to the forefront Paige'scompelling dilemma. Tracking down Eddie in Denmark after he returnshome to be with his ailing father, Paige finds herself suddenly engagedand faced with becomin g a princess. What she soon comes to understand,however, is that she is simply not cut out for being royalty, especiallyat the expense of a future medical career that she is so passionateabout. For a while, the film seems to be headed down a more honestand mature path than the average frothy romance, with Paige unwillingto give up her hard-earned dreams for a fairy tale life of luxury.  Due either to the spineless screenplay by Jack Amiel, Michael Begler,and Katherine Fulgate, or a last-minute reshoot, this appreciablyrealistic trajectory is not to be. The way in which Paige's quandaryand relationship to Eddie are wrapped up feels abrupt and cheap, foregoinga number of more truthful (and still upbeat) alternative endings forone that gives Paige the short end of the stick. For a young womanwhom the viewer has grown to like and admire, she is not treated withthe respect she deserves. Perhaps the ending of ""The Prince & Me"" is so disappointing becauseJul ia Stiles (2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"") injects Paige, as she canbe counted on to do with all her characters, with real intelligenceand resiliency. Stiles naturally has these character traits, almostno matter what the part, and here she ultimately comes off as farsmarter than the stock screenplay she is stuck within. What Paigeis asked to go along with in that sloppy final scene simply isn'tbelievable to how she would really react in the situation, and sothe whole film collapses around her. Julia Stiles is one of the verybest actresses of her generation, and is good enough to almost makethe film (minus the last minute or two) worth seeing. Not quite, butshe gives it her best shot.  As love interest Eddie, Luke Mably (2003's ""28 Days Later"") joinsthe ranks of Matthew Goode in 2004's worse ""Chasing Liberty"" and JoshDuhamel in 2004's better ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"" as no-namelove interests asked to basically be bland and withhold their biggerfemale co-stars. To his credit, Mably is plausible as a prince anddoes share adequate chemistry with Stiles, which is more than couldbe said between Goode and Mandy Moore in ""Chasing Liberty."" In bringing ""The Prince & Me"" to the screen, director Martha Coolidgeand sharing distributors Paramount and Lion's Gate have sold themselves,and audiences, short. A featherweight romance for teenage audiencesdoesn't have to invent the wheel, but it does need to treat its heroinewith the same respect put into setting up the character in the firstplace. ""The Prince & Me"" fails to do this, mist akenly believing thatall viewers will leave happy only if they see their lead female characterride away happily into the sunset with her prince. If that was theway the filmmakers wanted to go, then they shouldn't have set thestory in a place resembling the real world. The ending, plain andsimple, cheapens all that has come before.","Prince & Me, The",PG,2004,2.5
742," Disney's THE PRINCESS DIARIES, directed by Garry Marshall (RUNAWAY BRIDE andPRETTY WOMAN), is a charming, G-rated throwback to a more innocent time at thecinema, when movies were filled with humor that the whole family could laugh atwithout a trace of embarrassment.    A MY FAIR LADY type of story, it stars Anne Hathaway (""Get Real"") as someonewith the girlish awkwardness of a Haley Mills and the childlike beauty of aSandra Dee.  As 15-year-old Mia Thermopolis, Hathaway plays a high schoolstudent who is a card-carrying member of her school's out-crowd.  With hersave-the-whales buddy, Lilly Moscovitz, played blandly by Heather Matarazzo, Miafeels disdain for the school's inner circle.  Except, that is, for Josh Bryan(Erik von Detten), with whom Mia dreams of sharing her first romantic kiss.  Butwith frizzy hair so thick that it literally breaks hairbrushes, she is unlikelyto ever be noticed by a popular jock like Josh.  Mia, who lives with her artist mother (Caroline Goodall) in San Francisco, getsa visit one day from her paternal grandmother, whom she has never met.  Thegrandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), explains that Mia's deadfather was a prince and that, being the only one left of royal blood, Mia is theonly one who can rule their small European kingdom.  ""Shut up!"" a stunned Miareplies.  The queen's limo driver and right-hand man, Joe (Hector Elizondo), hasto explain that girl meant the reply as an expression of surprise and not aliteral command.  Rather than looking upon this opportunity as every girl's dream, Mia resists thechance to wear a crown.  ""I'm not ready to be a princess,"" she tells the queen. ""I'm still waiting for normal body parts to arrive.""  Much of the humor, of course, comes from Mia's training and transformation fromnerdish teen to elegant young woman.  With a gift for physical comedy, Hathawaymanages to make even the most clich_d pratfalls fresh and delightful.  Beautyexpert Paolo (Larry Miller), who is called in to fix Mia's looks, tells her, ""IfBrooke Shields had married Groucho Marx,"" their child would have had hereyebrows.  Once he finishes his magic, of course, it is a ""wow"" moment for thequeen and the audience.  For some reason, cinematographer Karl Walter Lindenlaub chose to light the movieharshly and brightly when a hazier glow would seem to have been a better choicefor this royal fairly tale.  His choice gives the images more of amatter-of-fact look than a magical one.   This sweet confection of a film goes down easily and is filled with many biglaughs.  It may not be the summer's most memorable movie, but it is a completelyentertaining one.  Most amazingly, it is a comedy for the whole family with arefreshing absence of bathroom humor.  You can take your 5-year-old and hergreat-grandmother, and they'll both enjoy the picture just as much as you do.  THE PRINCESS DIARIES runs about 1:40.  It is rated G and is fine for all ages.  My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film ** 1/2.  Although he thought it was funny,he said that he didn't like it as much as many other summer movies.  His friendMaxim, age 12, gave it *** 12, mentioning how funny and imaginative it was.  Hisfriend Sam, age 12, gave it ****, commenting that it was a very funny movie anda real crowd pleaser. ","Princess Diaries, The",G,2001,2.5
743," I saw Howard Stern's movie at the press screening, and I laughedthrough almost every minute of it.  The film opens nationwide thiscoming Friday, March 7.       First, let me assure my loyal readers that I have not been cloned.My evil twin is not the one writing this review, and I have not lost mymind.       First, confessions are in order.  Before seeing Howard Stern'smovie, called PRIVATE PARTS, I had never seen nor listened to HowardStern even for a single minute.  Moreover, I was absolutely sure thatI had no desire to ever see him.  I was so sure that his humor would begross and mean spirited that if there had been a conflict with anotherpress screening, as there frequently is, I would have gone to see theother film instead -- any other film.       Well, PRIVATE PARTS was the biggest pleasant surprise for me in aquite a while.  Yes, the film is certainly outrageous, but so wasAIRPLANE! (1980).  And yes, Howard is shocking.  I would postulate thatHoward Stern is one of the funniest and sweetest people around.Although I laughed so hard that I even got choked, the biggest surprisefor me was how tender and good spirited the show is even at its mostaudacious.  The plot even contains the long lasting love story betweenHoward and Alison, his wife of twenty years.  (All of Howard'sentourage in the film, with the exception of Alison, are played bythemselves.  Alison is acted by Mary McCormack.)       PRIVATE PARTS is the autobiography of Howard's life and is basedon his book.  In the first part, his father Ben (Richard Portnow) tellsHoward at every opportunity how moronic he is.  ""We never went toballgames,"" reminisces Howard.  ""The only sport my dad liked wasyelling.""  This gave Howard his tough skin and his obsession with beingliked.  Howard's antics, like those of any class clown, are disguised,plaintive cries to be wanted and be popular.       His ability to simultaneously disgust and involve an audience isseen when he is twelve.  He gives a traditional puppet show at a seniorcitizen's home that has them all dropping like flies.  He decides tojazz up the act with simulated puppet sex.  Needless to say, theaudience is so shocked and enraged that they can't take their eyes offthe stage.       Howard's movie isn't just about Howard.  The film is careful tofocus in on his supporting crew, especially Robin Quivers and FredNorris.  The first to join him was cherubic looking black newscasterRobin Quivers.  The rules of the time were that the DJ did his shtick,and when it came time, they switched to the newscaster.  From the firstday, Howard pulled Robin into his comedic fray.  She is as sweet assweet can be, but she can hold her own.  In her own more subtle way,she manages to top Howard in the banter on the air.  Robin gives amarvelously compelling performance in the film.       Although much of the show does happen on the air, a large portionis devoted to Howard's constant battles with management.  When hefinally works his way to the top -- the biggest radio station in NewYork -- the NBC lawyers read him the riot act.  There are seven wordsyou can not say on the air so he must stop saying them.  So what doeshe do?  In arguably the funniest scene in the show, he devises a matchgame where he picks a common word and lets his coworkers guess themissing, and, if taken out of context, obscene word that goes with it.(For example, if I say Hoover, you would say Dam.  This is not used inthe movie, but it is the only G rated one I could think of to give youthe idea.)  His nemesis and personal watch dog manager, Kenny (playedwith angry fervor by Paul Giamatti), goes ballistic when Howardviolates the rules.  Howard becomes vindictive and refers to Kenny onthe air only as Pig Vomit.       NBC executive Roger Erlick (Michael Murphy) says that ""Howard ison the FCC's Most Wanted List.""  NBC wants to fire him, but there is aproblem.  He has become the hottest DJ in the nation.  How long doesthe average listener stay tuned to the same station?  18 minutes.  ForHoward it is an hour and twenty minutes.  Well, how about the Howardhaters, the managers ask, since there are a lot of those?  Over twohours.  In both cases the reason is that listeners want to know ""whatwill he say next?""       ""After all, being misunderstood is the fate of all true geniusesis it not?""  laments Howard.  Even earning a fortune and havingmillions of fans, he still worries that people will think he is just amoron.       I do not want to mislead you.  The show manages to insult justabout everyone.  Still, the humor is non-stop, and based on the theateraudience's reactions, people respond extremely well to his jokes.  Gowith an open mind, and you may not be able to control yourself.Howard's film raises comedy to a new level.  I will reject the urge torecount more of the film's crazy antics and let you experience ityourself as I did.       As I left the theater I began to recount my favorite scene to myfriend I had taken with me.  As soon as I laughed my way through one, Ikept remembering another that was even better.  If the film had had onetenth the humor or one fourth the likeableness of its stars, I wouldhave counted it a success.  The movie it most reminded of was PEOPLEVS. LARRY FLYNT, but I liked PRIVATE PARTS better.       An incredible and unique experience.  An infectiously happy show.Howard teaches us to laugh at everything in life.  And yes, by the endwe have fallen in love with him, his comedic conspirators, and justabout everyone associated with the production.  A more likable group Ihaven't seen in a long time.       PRIVATE PARTS flies by at 1:49.  (Stay through the final credits,for the film keeps coming back on.)  It is rated R for strong language,dope smoking, crude sexual humor, and nudity.  Teenagers will probablylove it, but make sure they are mature enough for the material.  I givethe film my strongest recommendation and my top rating of ****. ",Private Parts,R,1997,2.5
744,"Could the virginal Florence Forrest (Lauren Ambrose) be the ""Butcher ofMalibu Beach?""  With her innocent smile, milky white skin and tomato-coloredhair, she certainly doesn't look like a likely candidate.  But with hersplit personality, her alter ego, a foul-mouthed, sexual predator named AnnBowman, might be the guilty party. If there ever was a film genre ripe for parody, it is those goofy 1960sbeach movies.  Robert Lee King's PSYCHO BEACH PARTY, written by CharlesBusch and based on his play, satirizes these old movies.  Laughing alongwith PSYCHO BEACH PARTY is silly fun.  With not a pretentious bone in itsbody, the movie pokes fun at the kids' raging hormones and at the homosexualsubtext of that genre.  In PSYCHO BEACH PARTY, however, the gay humor anglegoes way above subtext.   With a hall of mirrors effect, the story features many movies within movies,all of which are watched -- where else? -- at the drive-in theater.  Openingwith an Ed Wood-film wannabe, a horror movie about a blonde waitress with 3heads, starring Bettina (Kimberley Davies) as the middle head, the cameracuts back to reveal kids too busy making out in the cars to watch the movie. After the first of a series of murders, we switch to a sleazy go-go danceras the opening credits roll.  Then it's off to day at the beach where thebuff boys surf and the bikinied girls ogle them, and vice versa. Florence, deemed less than a chick, earns the nickname of ""Chicklet.""  Shewants to be a surfer like ""The Great Kanaka"" (Thomas Gibson) but is informedthat ""surfing is a man's domain.  No minnows in the shark tank."" Movie star Bettina, who rents a house near the surfers' beach, immediatelycatches the boys' eyes.  ""There's some prize tomatoes in that tin can,"" oneof them remarks when they first lay eyes on her, wearing a revealing top.The movie is full of such deliciously dopey dialog.  Another over-the-topinterchange occurs between Florence and Starcat (Nicholas Brendon), acollege student who, with his three psych courses, is already referred to as""doctor.""  ""If we were at war with the Soviet Union, I wouldn't even let youinto my bomb shelter,"" she tells him in her version of the ultimateput-down. The picture is wonderfully campy entertainment that doesn't ask anything ofits viewers. Just kick back and let the laughs begin. PSYCHO BEACH PARTY runs 1:35.  It is not rated but would be an R forlanguage, sexual situations and comic violence.  It would be acceptable formost teenagers.",Psycho Bach Party,PG-13,2000,3
745,"While Woody Allen hinted that movie directors may be blind in""Hollywood Ending,"" directors Adam Larson Broder and Tony R.Abrams go a step further albeit without much originality oftheme when they show that love can be blind as well.  Whatdoes a woman see in a man that enables her to love him? Some sociologists indicate that we really see ourselves; witnessthe number of couples who resemble each other physicallydown to the color of their hair and eyes.  But can we talk to theones we love?  That could well indicate how long a union canremain tight: we know that many a young person marries inhaste and repents at leisure after discovering that once thehormones fall under restraint, there's nothing left.       If we take ""Pumpkin"" to its natural conclusion, i.e. try to figureout what would happen to lovebirds Carolyn (Christina Ricco)and her latest beau, Pumpkin (Hank Harris) were they tocontinue their soulful relationship,  we cannot be too optimistic. After all, what do they have in common?       ""Pumpkin"" is in part an elementary treatise on what's calledlove and on a more superficial level a mildly satiric take onsororities; one that tries to skewer the airheads in two Greek-letter organizations but without the vulgarity of a  John Landis,who took aim at the easy target of college bubble heads in""National Lampoon's Animal House.""  The targets are easyones: prejudiced people and acolytes of rigid politicalcorrectness are slammed equally as are rich parents who throwmoney at their kids but do not even attempt to understand them. ""Pumpkin"" is light and entertaining summer fare but falls apart attimes because of logical flaws and silly motivations.     In this story Carolyn is a college senior (a millionaire'sdaughter in a PUBLIC college?) and a sister in Alpha Omega Pisorority, whose members are locked in a tight competition withthe all-blond airheads across the street for Sorority of the Year.  The group's president, Julie (Marisa Coughlan), impresses onCarolyn the importance of her showing up at the annual promwith handsome tennis star Kent (Sam Ball), as their merepresence would somehow grant points to the group.  Anotherway of scoring point is to mentor young men who are mentallychallenged so that they can participate in the Challenge Games. Carolyn draws wheelchair-bound Pumpkin, and is at firstrepulsed by his neurological condition and seeming inability tocommunicate verbally.  Predictably, though, she grows to lovethe challenged fellow because Pumpkin can ""understand her,""can ""see her soul,"" something her jock boyfriend Kent cannot. Community reactions are all negative: the AOPi prexy insiststhat they're not supposed to love the people for whom theyperform charitable service, Kent is furious at being quicklyshunted aside, and Pumpkins' mom, Judy Romanoff (BrendaBlethyn), who should be overjoyed, instead accuses Carolyn ofraping the hapless young man.     ""Pumpkin"" should have ended with Carolyn's becoming olderand wiser and realizing that if her sorority sisters do not likewhat she is doing, that's their problem.  The sisters, for theirpart, should not have been permitted by Broder's script to beconverted to Carolyn's way of thinking; and no way shouldPumpkin be able to chuck his wheelchair and become the starperformer in a Challenged Games relay race.  Worst of all is theway the story treats Kent, who would probably want to kill thedisabled fellow who ousts him from the competition forCarolyn's hand and who never should have survived a car crashthat has him plunge over a cliff at 100 mph, his auto exploding,and his turning up without a single burn mark on his face. ",Pumpkin,R,2002,2.5
746,"Comedy shows people worse than they really are and tragedyshows us better than we are.  While comedy is difficult (askanyone who's had to perform before a silent audience at Caroline'sComedy Corner), serious roles require depth.  We don't wonderthat actors known as comedians want to break out, to diversify, toshow their many dimensions.  Robin Williams did so beautifully in""One Hour Photo"" while Steve Martin turned in a dandyperformance in ""The Spanish Prisoner.""  But Adam Sandler? Could America's favorite movie clown, an expert at pratfalls and""duh"" expressions actually show a greater depth if he restrainedhimself and stopped performing strictly for the MTV crowd?  Whilehe'll probably never do ""Othello"" or ""Macbeth,"" he goes half-waytoward seriousness in a performance of unusual breadth.  What isso unusual about his role in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is that many in the audience could actually identifywith him.  (What fan of his could truly relate his own life to that ofthe waterboy?)  By contrast, Paul Thomas Anderson, whoknocked out perhaps the most serious, heaviest movie of 1999with ""Magnolia""-- a mosaic of misery with characters including adying man, an angelic male nurse, and concepts like anger, guilt,isolation, the sins of fathers and a rainstorm of frogs on a biblicallevel must have decided to take a vacation, to see how he couldhandle the light touch.     Sandler inhabits the role of Barry Egan, who has recentlystarted a business in toilet plungers, having invented one with anunbreakable handle.  He employs a handful of people whoprobably talk behind his back about what a loser their boss is, butLance (Luis Guzman) would never show his disdain when in hisemployer's presence.  Barry may be a loser but is the sort of loserthat some women would like to take home, possibly to mother,maybe even to love.  He's not threatening to them, he's obviouslynot a womanizes, he's safe to be with, and he's kinda cute.  Hedoesn't know how to act around women, perhaps because hisseven sisters abuse him mercilessly, calling him gay boy while atthe same time one of them tries to fix him up with a cutie whoworks with her, Lena Leonard (Emily Watson).     During the course of the movie, Barry gets into deep doggie-dooafter giving his credit card, phone number, address and socialsecurity i.d. to a crooked phone-sex operation, one that employsfour gangsters led by the over-the-top Dean Trumbell (PhilipSeymour Hoffman) to embezzle and otherwise separate Barryfrom his hard-earned cash.  The whole yarn was motivated by thestory of a real-life person who beat the system by investing just$3000 in Health Choice pudding which enabled him to parlayenough coupons to get him 1.5 million frequent flyer miles. Among Mr. Anderson's quirky scenes are a huge stack of thepudding lined up in Barry's warehouse; a surreal introduction withsuch fire power that nothing else matches it throughout the film;the bold use of color and especially a to-die-for sound track thatcomplements the action including ""Waikiki,"" ""Moana Chimes,""and especially Harry Nilsson's ""He Needs Me"" which bestdescribes the feeling that Lena, the shy and adorable Britishwoman, feels about her new lover.       What do women want?  According to this, they do not want anoverly confident man who will lead them around, who knows howto put his elbow on a bar and how to tip the maitre-d' withoutseeming obvious.  They want a klutzy fella, one who will not takeliberties with them on the first date or even after meeting them inHawaii for Barry merely extends his hand to shake that of Lenawhen they approach each other in Oahu, leading to the signaturekiss.      There's little question that the New York Film Festival chosethis to be one of its only three American choices partly because ithighlights Mr. Sandler in a far more restrained comic role than hehas ever attempted before, perhaps even more because ofAnderson's artsy, but not pretentious, style.  There are longtakes, as when Barry and Lena simply face each other and whenBarry faces off, nose to nose, with his archenemy, the crookedDean Trumbull.  Some of the fun requires audience attentionbecause the action often takes part in the background, as whenLance tests a couple of unbreakable toilet plungers while Barry isin the office tending to phone calls.  Photographer Robert Elswit'suse of bright colors is not unlike that of Todd Haynes in hisstriking new film, ""Far from Heaven,"" a glorification of the 1950'sstudio-lot melodramas that starred the likes of Lana Turner, AgnesMoorehead and Fred MacMurray.     As in the more conventional romantic comedies, Andersonkeeps the lovers apart for most of the story, separated not byLena's hesitation but by Barry's refusal to believe that anyonecould fall for him.  The violence is unlike anything you'd expectfrom a character played by Sandler, but at the same time, whenhe trashes the bathroom in a restaurant and slams his fistrepeatedly into the wall of his office and in one case curseshimself under his breath over and over, we understand that he isfilled with self-loathing for being such a loser.       I'd not go so far as to say that Sandler's usual public hungers tosee him in a role like this.  ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" with its longtracking shots, its occasional stoppage of forward motion, itssurreal imagery, will not go over big with the MTV-ers but mature,intelligent film buffs will eat it up.  Or enough of them will. ",Punch-Drunk Love,R,2002,3

748,"As The Jam once sang:'Life is a drink, and you get drunk when you're young.' This exhilarating tour-de-force is set in London in 1964: a booming erawhere wage-earning teenagers are eager for fashion, socializing, recreationaldrugs and music.  Above all, it focuses on the emergence of the 'Modernist'or Mod youth movement; and their tribal war with their 50's throwbackenemies, the grubby, Gene Vincent-adoring Rockers.The attention to detail is so vivid that while you are aware of theoften pointless superficiality of the Mod scene, you are at once drawninto its pulsating heart.Director Franc Roddam employs a young and virtually unknown cast, andthis gives the acting a natural rawness which brings the action alive.Gate-crashing parties, breaking into chemists, scooter rallies, tripsto Brighton, and Monday comedowns is the world where Jimmy (Phil Daniels)exists.  We may recognize aspects of it; we all empathise when events careerout of control.Roddam refuses to patronise or condemn the anti-social behaviour of theseteenagers.  Ultimately, the core issue of Quadrophenia is one young man'sbreakdown. Paul Daniels gives a career-best performance as Jimmy, a cocky hedonist withan insecure streak.  He puts his whole life into being a Mod, but alwayslays himself open to disappointment.  The girl of his dreams (Leslie Ash)is only leading him along; a hated Rocker (Ray Winstone) turns out to bea childhood mate; the 'Ace Face' of Brighton (Sting) is a hotel lackey;all his mates are merely weekend Mods to be part of a gang.Every one of the boisterous cast plays their part in this definitiverecreation of the Mod era. From its opening scenes, where a multi-mirrored scooter driver patrolsLondon, keeping one eye out for girls, the other for Rockers, we areplunged into Jimmy's teenage world of highs and lows.  With the progressingstoryline we encounter the amphetamine-fuelled escapades of his gang,as they meet in milk bars and plan their Bank Holiday excursion.  None ofthem are looking for anything more in life; Jimmy alone feels that somethingis missing, although he has no idea what this could possibly be. Quadrophenia is a raw and flawless depiction of a post-war London on thecusp of the Swinging 60's, and the youth cults enacting their alternativelifestyles at that time.  Particularly vivid are the gangs converging onBrighton, and the riots that instigated tabloid fury. There are many tremendous scenes.  When a hungover Jimmy throws up in hisoffice toilets, two of his bosses pretend he isn't there.  After encounteringan old mate at the local baths, Jimmy freezes when he sees the guy wearingRocker clothes.  He is trapped in a tribal mindset. Because the story is well and truly 'of the instant', the narrative merelygrinds to a halt after the anti-climax of Brighton weekend.  We never reallyknow where Jimmy is going next.A brilliant depiction of life in a youth cult.  Quadrophenia is loud,brash, gritty and quintessentially British.

Slow,plodding, pretentious and pseudo-serious, it offers only one plausiblereason to see it -- it features the late singer Aaliyah.  Aaliyah, as thefilm's eponymous character, receives a fairly modest amount of screen time,which is good since, to be honest, her acting leaves a lot to be desired. Stuart Townsend -- who, thankfully, was fired by director Peter Jacksonafter 4 days on the set of THE LORD OF THE RINGS -- plays the centralcharacter of Lestat.  Townsend is an androgynously sensuous actor who getsthe erotic part right and little else.  Every night, young groupies come twoa time to get their blood sucked by Lestat.  Sometimes, as when he cries out""More,"" meaning blood, he is unintentionally funny. Based on an Anne Rice novel, the movie is as gory as you'd expect.  Typicalof its grossness is a bar scene in which Queen Akasha (Aaliyah) rips out aguy's heart and starts chewing on it.  Apparently hearts are kind ofcrunchy.

Butin 1958 that belief was forever shattered with a scandalthat would gradually turn American Dream into nightmare...At least this is what screenwriter Paul Attanasio anddirector Robert Redford are trying to convince us in their1994 drama QUIZ SHOW.  The plot of the film is based on the true story that beganin 1958. In that time the most popular television show isNBC's ""Twenty One"". For several weeks one of itscontestants, Herbert Stempel (played by John Turturro) is onthe winning streak, earning huge amounts of money in theprocess. Producers, on the other hand, don't share hisenthusiasm because New York Jew with the bad teeth can'tmake sponsors happy. So, they pressure Stempel to take adive and find new, more suitable contestant in the form ofCharles Van Doren (played by Ralph Fiennes), good-lookingWASP college professor belonging to American intellectualaristocracy. After few months, disgruntled Stempelunsuccessfully tries to alert public about the rigging buthis efforts are fruitless until he meets with ambitiouscongressional investigator Richard Goodwin (played by RobMorrow).  Redford again showed his good directorial skills and therecreation of late 1950s is almost flawless. The acting isgreat - Ralph Fiennes is good choice for charismaticintellectual unable to cope with difficult moral choices;Turturro makes great contrast as victim nobody feels sorryfor and Morrow is great as relentless, idealist publiccrusader. QUIZ SHOW is, therefore, film that shouldn'tdisappoint the audience. But the same audience probably hasfew reasons to be very enthusiastic about this piece ofcinema. Reason for that lies in antiquated subject matter.Rigging of game shows perhaps represented something quiteshocking for 1950s public, but for newer generations, thoseraised on Watergate, Iran-Contra and Clinton presidency andthose who now take media manipulation for granted, this""scandal"" looks terribly insignificant. Those viewers couldhardly accept Redford's view of these events as somethingthat represented ""the loss of American innocence"". At leastnot without some sort of irony, but the irony is somethingthis film terribly lacks. Redford takes everything in thisfilm too seriously, and, in the end, this film looksoutdated and quixotic, resembling one of its characters inhis last futile crusade against emerging power oftelevision. However, this cinematic effort, although failedand, ironically, better suited for television as a medium,still represents one of more interesting (and rare) examplesof socially conscious 1990s Hollywood films. ",Quiz Show,PG-13,1994,2
751,"Cinema is a provocative medium and, every now and then, a film comesalong that not only entertains but elucidates important social issues asreflected through the microcosm of one human story. Australian director PhillipNoyce (""Patriot Games,"" ""The Saint"") probes a dark period in his country'shistory, set at a time when a 1,500-mile barbed-wire rabbit-proof fence wasunder construction. White men involved in this project often mated withAboriginal women, resulting in half-caste children who were forcibly taken fromtheir mothers in a cruel attempt to assimilate and, ultimately, breed ""thecoloured problem"" out of existence. These children became known as The StolenGeneration...and this is a true story of three little girls who were forciblytaken from their mothers in 1931 in Jigalong, Western Australia. The heroine is14 year-old Molly (Everlyn Sampi), whose silent resilience resonates and propelsher younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan)into running from the internment camp, then following the fence through theharsh Outback with a fierce determination to find their way home. Thereprehensibly misguided, racist villain is A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), ChiefProtector of the Aborigines, who dispatches a tracker (David Gupilil) andseveral officers after them. Christopher Doyle's stark, bleached photography isawesome, as is Peter Gabriel's score, utilizing indigenous rhythms andinstruments. But Christine Olsen's script lacks raw dramatic tension; theoutcome is a foregone conclusion; and there's so little character developmentthat the bereft mothers have more emotional impact than the trio of girls. Onthe Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a realistic,compelling 8, a bold triumph of the human spirit against overwhelming odds. ",Rabbit-Proof Fence,PG,2002,3
752,"When you ""came of age"" (meaning the time you realized thatyou were a human being not tied to you mom's umbilical), whowere your role models?  If you're a contemporary American,your model may not have be Michael Jackson or or George W.Bush, because Americans do not have heroes.  Chances areyou more or less followed in the footsteps of your more maturefriends or older brother.  If you were about thirteen in NewZealand in 1972 as is the principal character in Christine Jeffs'film ""Rain"" (based on Kirsty Gunn's novel of the same name),you watched your own parents.  In Jeffs' atmospheric andmoody movie set around an isolated seaside holiday area facinga muddy beach bordering crystal-green waters, thirteen-year-oldJaney (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki) settles in with her parents,whose marriage is disintegrating slowly but inevitably, whileneither Janey nor her precocious ten-year-old brother Jim(Aaron Murphy) can do a thing about it.   What makes ""Rain"" different from most other coming-of-agedramas is that two people of different generations are crossingboundaries.  The forty-something Kate (Sarah Peirse) has donesome traveling in her day including a trip to Japan where (""wehad a marvelous time"") and is not content with the domesticityincumbent on a middle-aged married woman with kids.  Not forher the endless round of making coffee and tea and cleaning upafter her brood.  When she spots a handsome and well-builtphotographer, Cady (Marton Csokas who resembles RussellCrowe), she sees a chance to transcend her staid ways and testnew boundaries.  In the same manner her daughter, whilefrustrated with her passive father, Ed (Alistair Browning), closelywatches the way her mom plays up to the hirsute and somewhateccentric Nikon-bearer who like others of his good looks andcharm need hardly lift a muscular arm to seduce a gal. The story gets its title not from any actual precipitation, butfrom the cloudy days serve as metaphor for the brewing stormabout to break on one dramatic day one which would (as thecliche goes) change the individuals' lives forever.  As thedistraught Ed, noting the uselessness of his building a vacationretreat to bind the family more closely, burns within at hisimpotence, Janey begins to wonder about this thing called sexwhich is touted as so wonderful and yet seems to be able tobreak a family apart.  She ignores the one fellow her own agewho makes a couple of passes (kissing him to scare him away),and makes a beehive for the comely cameraman to explore herpower as a female. As the film's cinematogapher John Toon pans the area,exploiting the threatening skies to evoke the mood of theperpetually bored and drinking vacationers, we're tempted toforego that trip to the southern reaches of the Pacific in favor ofmore lively adventures in Spain or Japan.  At the same time, weare treated to a well-acted, restrained and intelligent piece thatshould make the discriminating audience think back to their ownjoys and anguish that always accompany that time of life inwhich we carve new identities.",Rain,NR,2002,3
753," All of the elements for a can't-miss film were there. A David vs. Goliath story about an idealistic young man battling corrupt lawyers and a soulless insurance company, directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola from his screenplay of John Grisham's best-selling novel. Yet, ""The Rainmaker"" is a major disappointment, a self-righteous exercise in audience manipulation that chokes on its own smugness. While the film retains some pleasures, Coppola's heavy-handed direction snuffs out the sense of exhilaration a story like this should have.     The first hint of trouble comes from the official title, ""John Grisham's The Rainmaker."" The prolific Grisham has become a brand name, and whenever Hollywood slaps an author's name onto the title of a film, it's safe to expect the worst. Think of ""Stephen King's Graveyard Shift,"" ""Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough"" or ""Sidney Sheldon's Bloodline"" and you'll get the idea.   The story, while not exactly earth shaking, is durable enough. Recent Memphis law-school graduate Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon,) idealistic and eager to work, reluctantly hooks up with Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke,) a sleazeball lawyer who keeps a live shark in his office aquarium, lest we miss the other painfully obvious signs of his corruption. Stone pairs the kid with Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito,) an ambulance-chaser who has failed the bar six times, and sets the pair off to troll for business at a local hospital, where Baylor meets Kelly Riker (Claire Danes,) a young woman whose husband batters her on a regular basis.  Refusing to adopt his employer's tactics, Baylor takes his own path, renting a room from Miss Birdie (Teresa Wright,) an elderly client looking to cut her money-grubbing kids out of her will, leaving her assets to a televangelist instead. ""He needs the money,"" she explains, ""Why, the upkeep on his jet alone costs a fortune."" But Baylor's big case, and the centerpiece of the story, is a lawsuit against Great Benefit, an insurance company that specializes in shafting the poor. Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) is dying of leukemia and the company has flatly and repeatedly denied his claims, climaxing in a letter to his mother (Mary Kay Place) rejecting the claim for the ""final time"" and calling her ""stupid, stupid, stupid."" So the inexperienced young Baylor and his ramshackle assistant head for court, defending a dying boy and his poor family against a battery of high-priced lawyers, hatchet men for an evil corporation. Any idea how the case will turn out?   Fine, so its a obvious story with easy targets. Lots of memorable films have came from trite ideas. ""Hoosiers"" also told a David vs. Goliath tale, filled with every clich_ in the book, yet that film succeeds while ""The Rainmaker"" flounders. Why? Because inexplicably, Francis Ford Coppola undermines the very film he is directing. Coppola's work here is so ham-handed that it smothers the emotional impact of the story. Scenes of the corporate lawyers, led by Jon Voight, are painful studies in overkill. Coppola doesn't allow the bad guys even a hint of humanity. Instead, every shot shows them scowling, smirking or exchanging smug glances. They are nothing less than walking cartoons; watching them get their comeuppance carries about as much dramatic weight as seeing Yosemite Sam shoot himself in the foot.   Then there is Danny DeVito's Deck Schifflet character. ""The Rainmaker"" is designed to give viewers vicarious kicks by watching an idealistic young man bring down an arrogant corporation by taking on their unethical lawyers, yet Schifflet's equally corrupt behavior is played for laughs. Schifflet is a bottom-feeder, but presented as just a lovable little scamp. His antics disrupt the film's dramatic flow and become increasingly annoying as the story trudges along.  Thank goodness for ""The Rainmaker's"" strong cast. Matt Damon is fine in the lead role. He underplays the part nicely, investing Baylor with an appealing blend of awkwardness and strength of character. DeVito gives a hearty performance as well, despite how his character is misused. Claire Danes does what she can as the abuse victim, although the whole story involving her character is treated as a sketchy footnote to the film, rather than a major secondary story. Teresa Wright is appealing as the flighty, but feisty Miss Birdie, but the real scene-stealer here is Mary Kay Place, with a resonant performance as the mother of the dying young man.   Despite the best efforts of the cast, ""The Rainmaker"" packs little impact. Beyond all the problems with Coppola's direction, the simple truth is that you can find more inventive, better told stories than this by flipping on the TV and watching ""Homicide,"" ""Law & Order"" or ""The Practice."" You may not get John Grisham's brand name, but you'll save $7.00. ","Rainmaker, The",PG-13,1997,2.5
754,"Veteran director Garry Marshall is an unmistakably uneven filmmakerwho has made great motion pictures (1988's ""Beaches"") , some verygood ones (1999's ""The Other Sister""), some merely enjoyable piecesof fluffs (1990's ""Pretty Woman"" and 2001's ""The Princess Diaries""),some mediocre ones (1999's ""Runaway Bride""), and some notoriouslybad ones (1994's ""Exit to Eden,"" anyone?). Among everything, it cannotbe denied that he knows how to make films that are easily marketableto a wide mainstream audience. How else to describe making an unctuouslyconventional movie about S&M and another about a hooker? When GarryMarshall succeeds, he hits the nail on the head of his audience'ssensibilities. When he fails, he misses things by a mile. Such is the woeful case of ""Raising Helen,"" an acrimoniously cookie-cutteraffair without an honest bone in its body. The film practically screamsat every turn to be loved. Its every overly cutesy comedic momentyearns to bring the house down with viewers exploding in laughterat how wild and wacky and downright adorable the characters are. Itsevery saccharine, melodramatic moment wants viewers to pull out theirhandkerchiefs on command, as they lament about how touching it isthat one of the lovable characters are going through some sad times.Undiscriminating audience members may fall for it, although such apossibilities is hard to belief. For being so falsely sentimental,so out of touch with reality, and so, well, bland, ""Raising Helen""had my gag reflexes working overtime. Helen Harris (Kate Hudson) is a young, career-driven party girl climbingto the top of Manhattan's illustrious world of fashion. When her oldestsister (Feliicity Huffman) and brother-in-law are suddenly killedin an automobile accident, Helen is shocked to discover a will thatleaves her over her super-mom other sister, Jenny (Joan Cusack), withguardianship of nieces Audrey (Hayden Panettiere) and Sarah (AbigailBreslin) and nephew Henry (Spencer Breslin). Helen, a young womanwho hasn't completely grown up herself, doesn't know the first thingabout raising kids, but she accepts out of duty. Moving from her cozybachelor pad in Manhattan to a run-down apartment in Queens, Helenquickly finds her whole life in turmoil. She is fired from her fashionjob and becomes a receptionist for a used car dealership. TeenagerAudrey acts out by hanging with a bad crowd at school. Henry no longerwants to play sports because it was something he and his father usedto do together. Little Sarah is having a difficult time adjustingto life without her mom, who was teaching her how to tie her shoesright before her death. Jenny resents Helen for being chosen overher to take care of the children. And Helen attracts the eye of Dan(John Corbett), a Lutheran pastor who is also the principal at the kids' school. Like a sitcom that won't seem to end, a ll of the conflicts in ""RaisingHelen"" are tidily solved and and neatly wrapped up with a darlinglittle bow by the 115-minute mark. The problem is, none of it is donewell. The screenplay by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler has seeminglydeveloped all of the characters from a paint-by-number kit, as eachand every one of them do not plausibly have any sort of interestsor quirks outside of what is demanded by the script. Helen's journeyto becoming a parent and falling in love with her nieces and nephew„thecore premise„lacks the depth and details required to get a sense ofher burgeoning relationship with them. With only a couple scenes dedicatedto her interaction with Audrey (most of which are screaming matches)and Sarah, and only one major scene between she and Henry, the threecharges fail to become people we care about or even really know. Theysimply remain enigmas, necessary pawns to the plot, and director GarryMarshall shows no interest in them when he could, instead , be settingup another weepy moment or jokey one-liner. He never met a dead-endsubplot he didn't like (hence the two-hour running times of almostall of his films), and when all else fails, Marshall opts for a drawn-outmontage that goes nowhere. Kate Hudson (2003's ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"") needs to startchoosing her projects more wisely if she wishes to have the same careerdurability as mother Goldie Hawn. Hudson is an exuberant presence,but she hasn't had a role worthy of her talents since 2000's ""AlmostFamous."" As Helen, Hudson does what she can with a threadbare titlecharacter driven down by director Marshall's commercial-hungry hand.John Corbett (2001's ""Serendipity"") ably plays the thankless partof Helen's love interest, Pastor Dan, but their romance has abou tthe same level of charisma as a pile of wet twigs in a fireplace.Even Helen Mirren (2001's ""Gosford Park"") is wasted as Helen's boss,Dominique. It should also be noted that, whether it be a case of apoor director, little rehearsal time and preparation, or lacking performances,there are many parts where the actors seem at a loss for words, asif they are attempting to remember their next line. It's embarrassing to have to watch. The only performer to escape with most of her dignity intact is JoanCusack (2003's ""School of Rock""), who can brighten up any scene inany film in which she appears. As Helen's big sister, Jenny, a somewhatinsecure housewife with a knitting fascination, Cusack portrays theonly character who feels like a real person rather than a writtencreation. Cusack gets the few laughs that actually work, and the onlymoment s that are genuinely affecting; she is one of today's mostreliable and versatile actors. With ""Raising Helen,"" director Garry Marshall has concocted one ofhis very worst films, to date, a motion picture that tries so hardto win viewers over with its cuteness that it comes off feeling likeit hasn't tried at all. The film lacks spontaneity, the cameraworkis haphazard (one dramatic moment flounders terribly because the camerapulls back from the character rather than peer in closer), and Helen'smetamorphosis into a responsible, happy adult cannot be bought fora second by what is found on the screen. ""Raising Helen"" is cloyingbeyond belief, even when it clearly means well. It would be advisableto hand out barf bags in theaters showing this junky piece of false sentiment.",Raising Helen,PG-13,2004,2.5
755,"  How would you react to your mate's adultery? And how muchmore agonizing would it be if your spouse's accidental death preventedyou from asking the agonizing question: Why? That's the premise ofSydney Pollack's romantic drama, adapted from Warren Adler's novel byDarryl Ponicsan with a screenplay by Kurt Luedtke. And the concept isintriguing. Harrison Ford plays a detective in the Internal AffairsDivision of the Washington, D.C. police department and Kristin ScottThomas is a well-bred New Hampshire congresswoman running forre-election. They're strangers until his wife and her husband arekilled in a plane crash and it's discovered that the deceased werelovers, secretly traveling as ""Mr. and Mrs."" to a tryst inMiami. Grief-stricken, the survivors are thrown together as theyattempt to come to terms with their mutual betrayal. He'smasochistically determined to investigate every sordid detail, whileshe's deep into denial. ""Sooner or later, everybody knows everything,""he informs her. And that scandal is what terrifies her. Then abruptly,inexplicably, they desperately start groping each other. Inevitably,they're soon in bed, as if the answers to the emotional questionsthey're struggling to understand were hidden beneath thesheets. Looking scruffy, wearing an ear stud and sporting the world'sworst haircut, Harrison Ford is sincere, earnest and stoic, whileKristin Scott Thomas's chilly demeanor fails to ignite thisrestrained, ultimately dull, rebound romance - even though SydneyPollack delivers a strong performance as a media strategist. Andthere's a forgettable subplot involving gunplay with two corruptcops. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Random Hearts"" is awell-crafted but emotionally distant 5.

756,"      Kidnapping is the fear of every parent.  Nothing strikes terror asthe thought that one minute your kid may be there, and the next he hasdisappeared forever into a nameless crowd.  Consummate and alwaysreliable director Ron Howard (SPLASH, COCOON, PARENTHOOD, BACKDRAFT,THE PAPER, and APOLLO 13) displays the skill of a Hitchcock in craftinghis thriller RANSOM.       Let me cut to chase.  RANSOM really delivers the goods.  It is anengrossing picture that sweeps the audience into its vortex.  I predictthat audiences will love the show, and the film will easily earn aKing's ransom for Touchstone Pictures.       High on the list of what makes any picture a success is thescript.  Based on a story by Cyril Hume and Richard Maibaum and on a1956 Glenn Ford movie of the same name, Alexander Ignon and RichardPrice's script is highly intelligent and is always one step ahead ofthe viewers.       Kidnapping stories have a canonical, linear structure.  First thevictim is kidnapped, then the ransom is negotiated, and finally thereis the payoff.  RANSOM follows a much more unusual organization.Although the trailers and almost every review gives away one of the keytwists, I will not.  Suffice it to say that you should expect theunexpected.  In a mark of confident writers, they are even willing toset up blind alleys just to keep you on your toes.       Wealthy and confident entrepreneur Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson) hasbuild his airline from a single plane into a billion dollar empire.  Heis on the cover of BusinessWeek as ""Mr. Risk.""  As his wife Kate (ReneRusso) puts it, ""He's so shy.  Next month he's doing the underwearbillboard in Times Square.""  This is another beauty of the script.Thrillers require carefully applied humor to relieve some of thetension.       One gorgeous day, the Mullen family goes to Central Park for ascience fair.  Their only child Sean (Brawley Nolte from MOTHER NIGHT)is playing with a video camera attached to a balloon.  Since he isabout ten, his parents do not watch him every second.  As his cameragoes up, he is kidnapped.       As they do throughout the film, the acting of panic and fear byGibson and Russo is genuine and touching.  They earn and keep theaudience's empathy.  Nick Nolte's son Brawley has a lot to learn andhis is the only weak performance in the show.  Not a bad one certainly,and since he has only a small part, it makes little difference.       The kidnappers, including Evan Handler (NATURAL BORN KILLERS) asMiles, Donnie Wahlberg as Cubby, Liev Schreiber (DENISE CALLS UP) asClark, and Lili Taylor (GIRLSTOWN and I SHOT ANDY WARHOL) as Maris, area techno-savvy group.  The first note is sent via Email and is completewith chilling pictures of their son bound and gagged.  They give Tom 48hours to come up with a two million dollar ransom or they will killSean.  They warn Tom not to tell anyone.       Tom calls the FBI and soon kidnapping expert Agent Hawkins (DelroyLindo from GET SHORTY and BROKEN ARROW) and his team arrives incognitoto the Mullen's apartment.  Foiling the crooks is tougher than expectedsince they scramble their messages and block the phone traces.  Lindogives a compelling performance.  On the phone to his wife, Hawkinsconfesses, ""I am so glad we are not rich.  You have to thank god forwhat we have.""  Yes, the rich do live in their penthouses, but withwealth comes vulnerability.       Tom is perplexed by it all.  Since he is worth so much more, hewonders why they only want two million.  What does this mean?  In afurther complication, he is rumored to have paid off union boss JackieBrown (Dan Hedaya) to avoid a costly airline strike.  The payoff putonly Brown in prison, and Tom tells Hawkins that he thinks Brown mayhave some part in the kidnapping.       All along the way, the score by Academy Award nominated composerJames Horner (APOLLO 13 and BRAVEHEART) adds to the building tensionwithout ever overpowering it.  Similarly the images by Academy Awardnominated cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (RED) provide maximum impactwithout any cute tricks.  Only his highly effective slow motion, backand white ending sequence is out of the ordinary.       ""These cuffs are a little tight,"" says a small time crook.  Localcop Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise) tells him, ""that's 'cause they're new.They'll stretch.  You give 'em a little time.""  Jimmy, you see, worksthe beat near where the kidnappers have taken Sean into hiding.  Inthis ensemble cast, Sinise and Gibson stand out as the best of thebest.       As the terror of the situation sinks in on the Mullens, theirmarriage begins to strain.  To extricate himself from the familysquabbles, Agent Hawkins tells them, ""I'm not a marriage counselor.I'm here to get your boy back.""  In the best piece of acting in theshow, Gibson finally goes totally to pieces on their balcony.  Tom'sdevastation is complete at this point.       ""Shouldn't be a problem,"" tells the kidnapper to Tom.  Hereassures Tom at the same time he is lecturing him on the haves andhave-nots in society with references to the movie THE TIME MACHINE.Most films today would have overplayed this Robin Hood metaphor, butnot Ron Howard's.  His taste and timing are excellent.       After an exciting and frightening adventure, the film finallystarts drawing to a close.  Just when you think all of the kidnappershave painted themselves in a corner, you are surprised and surprisedagain.  When the credits start to roll, you turn to the person with youand go ""wow!""       RANSOM runs 2:01.  It is rated R for bloody violence and some badlanguage.  There is no sex or nudity.   It would probably be fine formost teenagers since the gore is reasonably contained, and the pictureis superbly crafted.  I strongly recommend the show to you and give thefilm *** 1/2.  (This happens to be a picture to which I was not invitedto the press screening.  Too bad since this is the first one I am awareof with the press kit on a CD-ROM complete with video clips.) ",Ransom,R,1996,2.5
757,"""Rat Race,"" a return to zany, comedic territory for director Jerry Zucker (1980's ""Airplane!"") after a decade-long bout with serious drama (1990's ""Ghost,"" 1995's ""First Knight""), is just the type of movie that never, or rarely, gets made today. Inspired by 1963's ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" and bearing certain similarities with 1980's ""The Cannonball Run"" and 1983's ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" ""Rat Race"" wastes no time with character-defining moments and rising sentimentality, because it makes no room for it. From the delirious opening credits sequence, in which the actors' heads are placed on cartoon bodies, to almost the very end, director Zucker and screenwriter Andrew Breckman pile on one sight gag or elaborate comic setpiece after the next, only to further punctuate how intentionally loony and unabashedly fun this movie is.  The setup is simple. At a Las Vegas casino, six people/groups are chosen at random by wealthy entrepreneur Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), and given a proposal that seems too good to be true. Seven-hundred miles away at a train station in Silver City, New Mexico lies a bundle filled with $2-million in cash. Located in locker #001, each group is given a single key that enables them to open it. The first one to successfully reach the locker gets the entirety of the cash, no strings attached. Sounds simple, but in true farcical fashion, every mishap that could ever possibly occur does.  The participants are young lawyer Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer), who hitches a ride from cute helicopter pilot Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart); Vera Baker (Whoopi Goldberg) and the now-grown daughter she has just been reunited with, Merrill Jennings (Lanei Chapman); just-fired NFL referee Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.); goofy, narcoleptic Italian Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson); dim-witted brothers Duane (Seth Green) and Blaine Cody (Vince Vieluf); and Home Depot employee Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz), with his chaotic wife (Kathy Najimy) and children (Brody Smith, Jillian Marie) in tow.  Written, directed, and acted by people who look to be genuinely enjoying themselves, ""Rat Race"" is, bar none, the funniest film of the summer. Inventive to the point of constant delight, the comedy comes so fast and furious that, at times, it is difficult to catch your breath from laughing so hard. And whenever you aren't in a state of hysteria, the sheer joyfulness of the whole enterprise leaves a smile plastered dumbly on your face.  The key to great visual comedy comes from setting up one uproarious joke, only to lead it to another that makes the situation all the more rib-tickling. Screenwriter Breckman, along with director Zucker, keenly understands this necessity and uses it to its best advantage. Because ""Rat Race"" relies on the surprises it has in store for the audience at all times, it would be a disservice to give any of it away. Suffice to say, a runaway heart, an unfortunate cow, a run-in with the psychotic Squirrel Lady (Kathy Bates), a bus for of ""I Love Lucy"" fan club members, and a museum of Adolf Hitler memorabilia, all figure in to the story.  There are no characters or performances that stand out from the pack because each one of the individual ensemble storylines is like a tour de force mini-comedy that has been strung together by a simple, yet effective, premise. Every main actor has about equal the screen time as everyone else, and each of them get ample chance to not only shine, but to show off their comedic skills. It is nice to see the underrated Whoopi Goldberg, however, get an opportunity to once again do what she does best after a string of wasted roles (2001's ""Monkeybone,"" 2000's ""The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle"").  If ""Rat Race"" is able to maintain its insanely high level of energy throughout, the conclusion could have admittedly been stronger. Going about ten minutes longer than it needed to, the way in which it deals with the winner(s) deciding what to do with the money is slightly disappointing, considering everything that had come before. An entertaining end-credits stage sequence recoups the film's brief lag with the cast performing the hit song, ""All Star,"" with rock group Smash Mouth.  Movies like ""Rat Race"" come around once in a blue moon. Not reliant on solely bathroom humor, and with a roughly twice-per-minute laugh ratio, the film moves at a clip pace that makes every moment all the more delightful. While not deep, meaningful, or life-changing, ""Rat Race"" plays like a brilliantly hilarious 113-minute joke that you can't, no matter what, get out of your head. ",Rat Race,PG-13,2001,2.5
758," RATCATCHER, the first feature film by writer and director Lynne Ramsay, could have been called BLEAK AND BLEAKER.  Unrelentingly downbeat, it tells a story of a family stuck in a miserable existence in the Glasgow slums.  Although the family lives in dire conditions, the movie is never able to define any of its characters enough for us to care about their plight.  With this rambling movie, which is only slightly better organized than a home video, Ramsay demonstrates almost no ability at storytelling.  When the inevitable tragic ending occurs, you almost have to stop yourself from applauding since you are so glad to get this waste of time over with.  As the story starts, James, a young lad of about 12, is involved in some innocent horseplay beside a canal.  His companion, Ryan, is accidentally drowned in the process.  James is played without one scintilla of emotion by William Eadie, who had never acted before being chosen for the part.  It shows.  Playing the central character, Eadie is asked to carry the movie, a task of which he is totally incapable.  The rest of James's family are walking clich_s.  His father (Tommy Flanagan), for example, is a drunk who passes out frequently, causing him to drool on the living room sofa.  The wife is the canonical long-suffering type who stands by her man.  The only character of any interest in the story is a neighborhood girl named Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen), who dispenses sexual favors to everyone for unexplained reasons, possibly in a failed attempt to be liked.  The character has potential, but Mullen's lifeless performance doesn't do much with it.  As the characters go from tedious tribulation to tribulation, I found myself passing the time by observing how Scottish English differs from American English.  The subtitling for the film doesn't try to translate the words.  It just records them to make them more intelligible for American audiences.  Among other words I found fascinating were: heid, innit and frae.  My wife said it best.  ""The depressing thing about this movie is that it isn't depressing,"" she remarked, shaking her head, as we left the theater.  With circumstances this tragic, we should feel sad, but we don't because the movie is so poorly constructed and the acting so incredibly bland.  RATCATCHER runs a long 1:33.

I wish I could fix him up with America Ferrera, whomakes her debut film performance in Patricia Cardoso's ""RealWomen Have Curves"" (in other words: ""Real Women arePleasantly Plump"") said to be the first movie with an Americandistributorship that is both directed and written by Latina women. This is a small movie on a coming-of-age theme that's not at allnew, i.e. the conflict between the youthful generation and the olderone.  Nonetheless we're talking the marvelous Lupe Ontiveros asthe latter force and Ms. Ontiveros (""Chuck and Buck,"" ""El Norte,""""As Good As It Gets"") can do no wrong.     Here's a film that might disturb traditional families living in theU.S. who are not into the yuppie idea that the aim of life is tobreak way from your parents' place as soon as you can earn abuck, take a pad in the city, and enjoy a rich social life far awayfrom your folks.  To conventional thinkers, this constitutes familybreak-up, and family is, as Dan Quayle reminded us quite a fewtimes, the paramount source of values.     Ana (America Ferrera) is part of a family unit and workplaceenvironment that for all practical purposes would approve of agraffito I saw recently placed on a posted featuring KateBosworth's Blue-Crush body, ""Feed me.""

She works in a sweatshopunder the benevolent stewardship of Estela (Ingrid Oliu), preparingdresses that the factory delivers to the contractor for $18 eachonly to be resold at Bloomingdale's for $600 per.  Despite the heatand Estela's resistance to use of a fan, the shop is a fun placepopulated by women of the same ethnicity who in the picture'smost comical scene do almost the Full Monty by stripping downto their unmentionables and dancing to bright mariachi tunes.     You get the impression that these blue-collar folks are the realAmericans, particularly when contrasted with the stick-up-the-buttboss who is ""doing a favor for you people"" by giving them thecontract.  Ms. Ferrera is a charmer, particularly when she movesher eyes toward the northwest whenever she receives acompliment from her first real boy friend, Jimmy (Brian Sites).

SALANT  ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - The first spy trial in 50 years that couldresult in the death penalty opened Monday with prosecutorsportraying a retired Air Force master sergeant as willing to sell outhis country for a price and his lawyers saying he had nothing ofvalue to offer.  Brian Patrick Regan is charged with offering classified informationto Iraq, Libya and China. If convicted, Regan could become thefirst American executed for spying since Julius and EthelRosenberg in 1953. The Rosenbergs were convicted of conspiringto steal U.S. atomic secrets for the former Soviet Union.       Seems we're back in the 1950s except that now that Pootie-Poot and President Bush are tete-a-tete, the guys with the bigbucks trying to recruit American spooks are from the Middle Eastand (surprise) our Coca-Cola drinking buddies in Beijing as well. In Donaldson's thriller, written by Roger Towne, Kurt Wimmer andMitch Glazer, the CIA is back in fashion and, now that ourpresident has authorized assassinations around the globe,applications are said to be hitting the roof.  Nonetheless,bypassing all the bureaucratic paper from eager and patrioticcollege seniors, long-term CIA instructor Walter Burke (Al Pacino)is intent on recruiting a guy who he thinks has Central Intelligencein his blood. Fortunately for the women in the movie audience,that guy is about the most ruggedly handsome young actor intown, Colin Farrell, who plays M.I.T. top graduate James Claytonwhose muscles match his mind and who per formula falls in lovewith a classmate named Layla (Bridget Moynahan).  Is Layla themole being sought by Burke?  Is Zack, A Farsi-speaking white-bread fellow also in training?       This big mystery notwithstanding, the most fortuitous feature ofthis cloak-and-dagger tale is not the pursuit of the villain; not theobligatory car chase, not the one explosion that takes place onthe set, but the look-see that Donaldson gives us into the makingof a CIA operative on the training grounds known as The Farm. For those who think the Central Intelligence Agency has becomea bunch of tired old men pecking away at their computers issuingdata that look more like make-work than attempts to catchOsama, ""The Recruit"" sets us straight.  It's a lot more fun.     Lest anyone in the audience not catch the tagline, Pacino'scharacter repeats it several times: Nothing is what it seems.  Forexample, blink and you may not catch the sign that appears nearthe entrance of the CIA building at Langley, ""George Bush Centerof Intelligence.""  Is the sign real or an example of Donaldson'ssense of humor?  The otherwise humor-challenged picture pitsWalter Burke as a father figure to James Clayton, with Al Pacino'susual over-the-top performance directed toward a man who hadlost his father in 1990 in a mysterious plane crash over Peru. Despite an offer by a major computer company that could seeJames making 200K in a matter of years, idol-worship of his dad,presumably a CIA man, motivates Clayton's taking the bait fromBurke, joining that instructor's CIA training program, and jumpinghoops to make the grade as a force for truth, justice and theAmerican way.  Falling for an intelligent classmate, Layla (BridgetMoynahan), he is shocked to hear from Burke that Layla is undersuspicion for selling secrets to the enemy and assigned by Burketo the job of flushing out the evidence.     The first seventy-five minutes, though not edge-of-your-seatsuspenseful, provide the audience with a look inside the topsecurity building at Langley including some tests which may ormay not be currently used.  One involves a major step forward inlie detection wherein a machine magnifies the eye to search forsigns of dilation which means that the testee is telling a big fib. Aside from that, James Bond toys are limited in a film that isbetter in demonstrating the hazards of CIA hazing than inpresenting a believable or even clear outline of its concluding halfhour.     Acting is tops, with the handsome, Irish-born Colin Farrellstanding up quite well against the intimidating Al Pacino whileBridget Moynahan, who lacks Farrell's flat-out appeal, turning in aworkmanlike performance.  If anyone wonders how you're going tokeep 'em down on the Farm when private industry pays six figuresto the caliber of people in Central Intelligence, the pure excitementof basic training may in itself provide the answer if you have it inyour blood. ","Recruit, The",PG-13,2003,2.5
761,"      ""You will be shot in a week, and the cost of the bullet will bebilled to your family,"" warns the attorney for the defense.  In thekangaroo courts in THE RED CORNER people are summarily shot unless theyconfess their guilt quickly and beg for leniency.       Jack Moore, played all too coolly by Richard Gere, is an Americanentertainment broker who is in the People's Republic of China tonegotiate a huge television deal with the Chinese government.  After abeautiful young woman in a nightclub invites him to bed, he is awakenedthe next morning by a phalanx of troops.  With blood all over him, heis arrested for the death of his one-night-stand, who turns out to bethe daughter of an influential general.       As his court-appointed lawyer, Yuelin acts initially like adogmatic party bureaucrat.  Bai Ling plays Yuelin as a cross betweenHercule Poirot, Joan of Arc, and Patrick Henry.  Although at first sheinsists on pleading her client guilty even if he refuses, she changeshis plea to not guilty and begins pulling one rabbit after another outof the hat as she unearths clues.       All of this sounds better than it is.  The script by Robert King(CUTTHROAT ISLAND and SPEECHLESS) and Ron Koslow (LAST DANCE) is unableto create any credible supporting cast.  Other than the two leads,almost all of the Chinese are sinisterly evil and the Americansincompetently duplicitous.  The script parades so many minor characterspast us that we need a scorecard to keep them straight.  All are drawnin caricature, and none have any depth.  (One hint to the befuddledviewer.  The merely bad Chinese wear military uniforms, but the mostnefarious are those Chinese in expensive Western suits.)       Jon Avnet's direction does not alleviate any of the confusioncreated by the jumble of the narrative.  Watching the film is ratherlike trying to make out what two characters are doing as they weavetheir way through a blizzard.  The story seems intent on making strongpolitical statements, exactly what they mean is less clear.  It wouldappear that the film stands foursquare against brutality, but most ofthe subtext remains murky.  This much is clear: Jack was framed bypowerful forces, and his eminent demise is merely a piece of somecabal's larger plans.       If the characters were more genuine or the story more plausible,one could more easily be moved by Jack's mental and physical torture.The scenes are stagy even if the settings are genuine.  And the moviekeeps testing how far we are willing to go in suspending disbelief.  Myfavorite improbability occurs when the police state gives Jack a dayoff from the trial so he can go to his attorney's house to plan hisdefense.  They end up going all over town, albeit with guards, to trackdown the clues.  Oh, and did I mention that Jack first asks hisattorney to demonstrate her skill as a musician?  One minute Jack isworried about his execution, and the next he is much more concernedwith the well being of his attorney. ",Red Corner,R,1997,2

Periodically, the director(Ted Demme who I think is Jonathan Demme's brother) would pick up thepace a la SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION and the film would really hum.  Theactors responded very well to the increased pacing and came alive.Most of the time, however, the movie would start clicking and then someinvisible hand would reach out and grab a lever and slow it down for noapparent reason.       The characters would have been better if the script (RichardLaGravenese and Marie Weiss) were written a bit more sympathetically.I did not care about anyone in the show.  Well, I guess maybe the thiefhad some possibilities for likeableness.       I read one review that said he thought the show was the funniestcomedy he had ever seen, BUT when he saw it a second time he onlybarely liked it.

763,"A precocious 12-year-old boy (Ben Thornton) in present-day Londonis visiting his mother (Alice Krige) while she works underground witha construction crew. What he awakens while investigating one of thetunnels they have discovered is a giant, fire-breathing dragon thathas laid dormant for thousands of centuries. Thus begins ""Reign ofFire,"" which opens with such a startling and truly frightening bangthat it comes as a tremendous disappointment when, 100 minutes later,the film ends with a half-hearted whimper. Credit director Rob Bowman(1998's ""The X-Files"") for treating the subject of destructive dragonswith a rare seriousness unusually found in the genre. Discredit Bowmanfor apparently using up most of his effective scare tactics and filmmakingenergy in the first ten minutes alone. As the opening credits run, we are caught up to speed with the fateof the world following this catastrophic find. Entire cities are destroyedas the dragons breed, and the human population is whittled down tonearly nothing. Switch forward to 2020, where the young boy--now theadult Quinn (Christian Bale)--has become the leader of a refugee settlement.While the group spend their days playing it safe and using stringentprecautions against any dragon invasions, this changes for Quinn withthe appearance of hard-core zealot Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey),head of an American military team. Van Zan is determined to stop thedragons and attempt a repair of their home. In order to do this, however,they must head back into the ruins of London to find the sole maledragon. If they can destroy him, it will mean the extinction of furtherlife for the species. The premise of ""Reign of Fire"" is an exciting one that, ultimately,does not translate into an exciting film. Using top-notch CGI farmore seamlessly believable than in other recent films, such as ""Spider-Man""and ""Attack of the Clones,"" the dragons come to life in a very palpableway that blends well with the actors onscreen. Unfortunately, thisis a case when the budget of a picture clearly was not expandableenough to withhold such an ambitious story. While the visual effectsare awe-inspiring, there aren't enough of them. The dragons only appearin five extended sequences, leaving the remaining 70 minutes up tothe human actors to make engaging. Endless expositional and ""character-building""scenes drone on and on, significantly pulling the pace of the filmto a crawl. Even then, we still never gain true insight into who thelead characters really are as people. The screenplay, by Gregg Chabot,Kevin Peterka, and Matt Greenberg, should be dealt the majority ofthe blame, ! as precious little dialogue of interest is offered up. Try as they might, Christian Bale (2000's ""American Psycho"") and MatthewMcConaughey (2002's ""Frailty"" and ""Thirteen Conversations About OneThing"") give stiff portrayals of one-dimensional characters. Bale'sQuinn is presented as a heroic figure, but Bale solemnly broods andsulks his way through his scenes. McConaughey goes in the oppositedirection; his over-the-top turn as the extremist Van Zan may elicita certain amount of showiness, but he remains a bland figure whomthe viewer can never quite figure out. As Alex, the token female onVan Zan's side, Izabella Scorupco (2000's ""Vertical Limit"") is allpretty looks with nothing going on inside. In other words, she's a complete bore. This leads us to the action set-pieces, which jump-start the filmto life roughly every twenty minutes. While there is not a solitarymoment that captures the fear and dread of the horrific prologue,a skydiving scene midway through in which they are chased by dragonsin hot pursuit is an undeniable nail-biter. The climax set in London,meanwhile, lacks the scope and true horror of the situation to be a satisfying finale. ""Reign of Fire"" valiantly attempts to add more substance than usualto a special effects actioner, but to no avail. Save for an endingscene in which the first sign of the world's modern reconstructionis glimpsed, such high-minded efforts either fall flat, or get lostamid the sound and fury. Likewise, there are so many glaring plotholes that it eventually becomes too tedious bothering to take anythingseriously. Because the opening moments hold so much promise, the remainderof ""Reign of Fire"" is all the more disappointing.",Reign Of Fire,PG-13,2002,2.5

Stevens has a religiousdedication to his job that is awe inspiring.  You might want toquestion at times why he is so dedicated, nevertheless, you have to beimpressed at someone who would give himself over body and soul to hisjob.

Theother actors and actresses in the show were fine, but nothing special.To put my review in context, I saw HOWARDS END, where these two greatstars last appeared together, and found it only mildly interesting.Here, their every scene was compelling.       I found the movie very peaceful and extremely serene.  I am sureothers will see the movie and think it depressing or get angry thatStevens was unable to break the chains that bound him.

765,"Life in the military requires sense of discipline, direction,hardships and risks most of the people in prosperous industrialnations aren't willing to take. As a result, recruiting base ofprofessional armies is becoming the domain of impoverishedmisfits who couldn't have adapted to ""normal"" civilian way of life.Protagonist of RENAISSANCE MAN, 1994 comedy directed byPenny Marshall, is reminded of this fact. The plot, based on thescreenplay by Jim Burnstein, begins with Bill Rago (played byDanny De Vito), unemployed advertising expert from Detroit, in adesperate need of job. So he takes the first offer that comes andbegins working as civilian instructor at the nearby military base.His job is to teach ""thinking skills"" to the class of eight hopelessrecruits. Both the teacher and his class are initially sceptical andun-enthusiastic towards this academic endeavour, but Rago wouldslowly begin to build mutual respect and incite learning drive in hispupils by using Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"".  RENAISSANCE MAN is ""high concept"" project so typical of 1990sHollywood - comedy based around single joke. In this case thehumour is based on simple ""fish out of water"" scenario and clashbetween two worlds - white-collar sophistication embodied inRago's character and blue-collar simplicity embodied in recruits.Unfortunately, scriptwriter Burnstein at times seems undecidedwhether to make genuine comedy or serious social drama andthrows material that would inflate running length to almost twohours. There are some characters who serve only as an excuse forbrief and unnecessary appearances of otherwise good actors likeGregory Hines and James Remar. What saves this film is directionby Penny Marshall who, despite her reputation of ""tearjerker""specialist, puts an emphasis on comedy and thus givesRENAISSANCE MAN its ""feel good"" credentials. Danny De Vito isalso good in his role, same as those playing the recruits, youngMark Wahlberg being most notable of them all. All in all, despite itslimitations and more than obvious flaws, RENAISSANCE MAN ismore than watchable little ""feel good"" film that could be used asan example of Hollywood craftsmanship. ",Renaissance Man,PG-13,1994,2

Aronofsky, who rocketed to fame with his first indie film, PI, is back with a roller coaster ride about drug addition.  It is an audacious film that will certainly win an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn, who plays Sara.  And if there were any justice in the world, it would win one for Aronofsky as well.  This movie, however, is the complete antithesis of a Hollywood production and so has little chance of being recognized with Best Picture or Best Director nominations.  First and foremost, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is an assault on our senses.  Easily the most visually audacious movie of the year, its camerawork (Matthew Libatique) and editing (Jay Rabinowitz) are astounding.  Approximating the effects of drugs on the brain, sometimes the film speeds up like a bullet train, and other times the action slows to a crawl.  Especially effective are the close-up images of everything from drug preparation to pupil dilation to paper airplanes.    The cornucopia of images flow over our systems like a drug rush.  We aren't merely witnessing the cataclysmic effects of drug addiction; we are experiencing them up close and personal.  The director makes just the right choice in minimizing the surrealistic scenes in favor of speeding up the realistic ones.  >From the first frame, the director comes out swinging.  The film doesn't really start, per se.  Instead, we are thrown into a story that has been going on for a while.  We feel much like viewers who have just turned on in the middle of a television series.  When we meet the angelic-looking Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), who loves his Ma, Sara, dearly and adores his girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), he is busy stealing his Ma's television.  After pawning it, he buys drugs to get high with his friend, Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans).   His mother just heads down to the pawn dealer to buy it back again in a ritual that seems to have been going on since the dawn of time.

Its big rules on its road to nirvana include no red meat and no refined sugar.  One day she is invited to come on the show sometime in the indefinite future.  This causes Sara to move up the addiction chain.  In order to get into her old red dress for the show, she goes to a diet doctor.  (""How are you, Mrs. Goldfarb,"" the nurse asks perfunctorily, as Sara steps onto the scales.  ""Enormous,"" she replies in embarrassment.)  The doctor prescribes salvation in the form of a heavy regiment of diet drugs.  Although losing weight initially makes her popular among the little old Jewish ladies that live in her building and wile away their days trying to soak up the sun, eventually it destroys her body and her mind.  Meanwhile Harry, Tyrone and Marion are busy devising a series of get-rich-quick schemes involving selling drugs.  Harry brags to his Ma that he is working for ""sort of a distributor for a big importer.""   So hyper with diet pill uppers that she looks in danger of exploding, she doesn't ask for any details.  Their plans, however, are thwarted by their overriding need to consume what they are supposed to be selling.  This puts them down a path of destruction that leaves them doing absolutely anything to get drugs to feed their habits.  For Marion, the bottom of the pit occurs when she puts on a two woman sex show for a room filled with suits.  As the four of them descend into their own hells, it is hard to watch but impossible to look away.

Here's what the two movies do have in common...  --Scenes of intelligent, amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --A story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in alogical, chronological sequence --Graphic yet necessary violence --An engaging crime story --Dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --Three of the same actors (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi) --A Mexican standoff ending, although this one is considerably less optimisticthan PF RESERVOIR DOGS is an entire hour shorter than PULP FICTION because it's only got one story to tell rather than three. Crime lord Joe Cabot (veteran actor Lawrence Tierney) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist. The five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated. Instead, they are all given code names off the color chart -- Mr. White (Keitel), Mr. Pink (Buscemi), Mr. Orange (Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Brown (Tarantino) and Mr. Peach (Tarantino's chin). Most of the movie's running time is spent with Mr. White and Pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive. Mr. Orange, meanwhile, is on the floor, dying from a gunshot wound. The police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon, leading White to believe one of the five was an informant. The story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks, of the crime itself and the meetings between Joe and the criminals prior to the crime. Eventually, Blonde arrives with a police officer hostage, and what follows is a truly brutal, uncomfortable torture scene. Let's just say Picasso would be inspired by what Blonde does to the cop's ear. A lot of the time, RESERVOIR DOGS seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie, but there are a few sequences that are uniquely Tarantino. The opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to, as the criminals plus Joe have a conversation on, among other things, tipping philosophies and their interpretations of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin."" Another scene involves Roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana. Neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop, like the Captain Koons gold watch speech in PULP FICTION, only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie.

Anderson(director of the original and also responsible for the failure thatis ""Alien vs. Predator"")„who don't know the first thing about generatingsuspense, frights, cohesive storytelling, and a reason to care. Theyalso have failed to correct any of the countless mistakes made in the original. Opening where the predecessor left off, Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakensin a deserted laboratory to discover a newfound strength and her townof Raccoon City taken over by virus-infested zombies. With the remainingliving humans stranded within the city limits and a bomb aimed towipe everything out at dawn, Alice teams up with tough-as-nails copJill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and a rag-tag group of soldiers andfellow survivors to find an escape route. With the infected (includingrotting dogs and other myriad unidentified creatures) coming at themfrom all angles, an offer arrives from Umbrella Corporation scientistDr. Ashford (Jared Harris), who will provide them with a helicopterif they can rescue his young daughter, Angela (Sophie Vavasseur),from the school she is holed up in. Based on the Capcom video game series, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""is a spineless horror film, contemptible toward its core audienceof video game fans and zombie flick lovers. It also pitifully wastesits valuable R-rating when so many genre films these days are compromisingtheir vision in exchange for the kid-friendly PG-13 (the most recentcuprits: Anderson's own watered-down ""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Anacondas:The Hunt for the Blood Orchid""). The MPAA is not to blame this time„theyproved with ""Dawn of the Dead"" that they will now let slide gallonsupon gallons of bloodshed and gore without censorship„and so it comesas an even larger discouragement that ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""is rated R more for its harsh language than because of its visceraltraits. Alarmingly, the recent series premiere of the ""Friends"" spin-off,""Joey,"" literally featured more blood in one scene than this cut-and-dryjunk has in all 95 minutes. As for the villains themselves, the zombieshave so little screen time and are often so obscured by quick cuttingand dark lighting that it is understandable if one occasionally forgetshe or she is watching a zombie flick. Many of the movie's faults could be solved if director Alexander Wittknew, or even cared, how to create tension, but he doesn't. In placeof a feeling of dread is a numbing swirl of explosions, gunfire, derivative""Matrix""-inspired fights, and incomprehensible action edited by theapparently ADD-prone Eddie Hamilton (2002's ""Swept Away""). The plotis nondescript, with Paul W.S. Anderson not even bothering to makesense of what he has written. As for the characters and actors inhabitingthe skin-deep roles, none are worth mentioning aside from the unbearableMike Epps (2003's ""The Fighting Temptations""), whose wise-cracking,thoroughly unfunny L.J. is the latest in a current line of despicablystereotypical black characters polluting the horror genre. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" isn't the torturous experience it couldhave been to endure, but it is abhorrently clueless, all the same,both on how to stir up the barest of apprehension within the viewer,as well as how to form likable characters and an involving story worthinvesting in. As impossible as it may seem, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""might just derive from a lower-common-denominator of zombie-centeredfilmmaking than 2003's utterly crummy ""House of the Dead."" Now that is scary. ",Resident Evil: Apocalypse,R,2004,1
769," And so we come to the final part of the Star Wars trilogy. Many peopleconsider this to be the least of the trilogy, but I find this one justas entertaining as the other two. The start of the film, in Jabbaspalace, is good, and right through to the end, the film is highlyenjoyable. The film seems to centre more on action scenes than actualplot and character relationships, but this dosen't affect it one bit.The director handles the action and plot revelations very well, JohnWilliams booming score goes with the film very well, and the specialeffects are excellent. OK, so Marquand may spend a bit more time thanneeded than the Ewoks, but he makes up with the storming of the shieldgenerator by the Empire, and the battle that follows in space.  So, I find this film to be entertaining, hugely enjoyable fun, and afitting end to the trilogy. If there was a bit less Ewoks, and maybesome Empire scenes (the bad guys hardly feature in this film except atthe end) this would be perfect. However, it is great as it is! Highlyrecommended. ",Return of the Jedi,PG,1983,3
770,"Tinged with traces of ""Love Story,"" ""Ghost"" and ""Moonstruck,""this romantic comedy has its moments - but, unfortunately, most ofthem turn out to be sappy. David Duchovny doffs his ""X-Files"" FoxMulder persona to play a successful Chicago architectural engineerwhose wife (Joely Richardson), an ardent zoologist who works withprimates, dies in an automobile accident in one of the early scenes ofthe picture. While he's still blood-stained and grief-stricken, hiswife's heart is transplanted into Minnie Driver, who's a shy, naivewaitress working in her family's Irish-Italian restaurant. Despite thebizarre circumstances, you know that these two are eventually gonnameet and fall in love. Predictability and foreshadowing weigh heavilyon the script written by Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake. Perhaps a moreexperienced director could have quickened the pace, trimmed somescenes, and meshed the elements better - but inexperienced Bonnie Hunthelms her own material. In addition, she co-stars, as Driver'sconfidante and wife of Jim Belushi, and she's cast at least fourrelatives named Hunt in supporting parts. It's like a congenial familymovie under a big studio banner. Despite its lack of focus, it isamusing to watch it unfold, particularly when senior pros like RobertLoggia and Carroll O'Connor are bantering about old singers, oldsongs, etc., since the title song comes from a vintage Dean Martinballad. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver are charming to watch; onejust wishes they had wittier, more sophisticated material to workwith.

772,"      For someone who is a strict traditionalist when it comes toShakespeare, and to opera too for that matter, I was amazed at how muchI was enthralled by Ian McKellen's vision of RICHARD III as a World WarII British Fascist.  This is a well acted production where the imagesare even more impressive than the acting.  Usually when critics say theimages are the best part of a movie, they are reviewing a mediocre showwhere the visuals are its redeeming feature.  Here they enhance analready outstanding production.  As an aside, the theater where I sawthe film had an overscan problem and the opening title clearlyproclaimed the movie to be RICHARD II so I thought for a second I wasgoing to see a prequel.       After hating director Oliver Parker's recent and dreary renditionof OTHELLO, it was refreshing to see director Richard Loncraine breathsuch tremendous life-force into RICHARD III.  No since the even betterKenneth Branagh's HENRY V and Franco Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET,have I enjoyed Shakespeare so much.       Ian McKellen is the executive producer, cowriter along with thedirector, and lead actor.  The film is based on Shakespeare's play, butI believe many of the lines were either rearranged or abbreviated.  Iread that Ian McKellen spent several years trying to sell variousHollywood studios on the making of this film, but when the studios readthe script, they kept saying that they hoped he made it, but they werenot going to be the ones to fiance anything that bizarre.  Eventually,he got the funding, and the movie is a triumph.  Whether there is a bigenough audience for a film like this to turn a profit is anotherquestion of course.        RICHARD III starts with a dance in a royal ballroom.  The band isplaying 1930s dance music.  People come in and greet each other,seemingly with great happiness.  Finally, the music ends and Richard,Duke of Gloucester (Ian McKellen), delivers the famous ""Now is thewinter of our discontent"" speech.  In this speech and most others inthe movie, it is pronounced and given nuances fresh and not found inmost actors' Shakespearean repertoire.  The speech actually continuesas nature calls, and Richard leaves to use the urinal.  In most moviesI find contrivances like soliloquies in the bathroom to be silly atbest, but McKellen's strength of acting manages to pull it offeffectively.       This is a fascinating and true story that averages a murder everyfive minutes, and thanks to great editing by Paul Green, the movieflies along.  As Richard says, ""plots have I laid.""  As the words movedfast and furiously, I realized why Shakespeare is so unapproachable toa mass audience, it requires attention.  Unlike the sound bites ofpolitical campaigns or MTV, all thoughts are not delivered in shortsentences full of monosyllabic words designed to let the brain stay onautopilot.  I will not insult your intelligence by attempting acondensed version of the story here.  Instead I will concentrate onreviewing the film itself.       The cast is full of good actors and actresses who are coached bythe director to give some of their very best performances even thoughtheir roles may be quite minor.  Robert Downey Jr., for example, playsRivers and has less than a dozen lines, but delivers them to greateffect.  Adrian Dunbar plays Tyrell as a chilling man who has almost asfew scruples as Richard.  Jim Broadbent has a larger (pun intended)role as Buckingham, playing him as the Herman Goering of the picture.       Annette Bening is wonderful as Queen Elizabeth, the wife of KingEdward (John Wood).  After Richard has killed her two sons, a.k.a.,""the little princes"", Bening delivers her best lines.  She says, ""Ihave no more sons of the royal blood for you to slaughter.""  Richardsmiles deviously and replies with a sweet voice, ""You have a daughter.""In another she asks him, ""Shall I be tempted by the devil then?"".  Hequickly retorts in a melodious voice, ""Yes, if the devil tempt you todo good.""       Kristin Scott Thomas plays Richard III's wife Lady Anne.  She isdegraded by him and becomes a heroin addict.  In one shocking scene wehave her hiking up her dress to shoot up.  A chilling performance, buta bit hard to watch.       Now who else have I forgotten in this ensemble cast?  There isNigel Hawthorne as Clarence, Maggie Smith as the Duchess of York, JimCarter as Hastings, the great Edward Hardwicke as Stanley, TimMcInnerny as Catesby, Bill Paterson as Ratcliffe, Donald Sumpter asBrackenbury, and Dominic West as Richmond.  There is not a bad actingjob in the movie.       The best acting, and one worth many awards, is that of IanMcKellen.  He creates a ruthless tyrant who is willing to kill men,women, and children of any age if they get in his way even for amoment.  During his villainy, he manages to grovel in front of his soonto be victims as if he is their devoted servant.  In perhaps his keyline, delivered in a 1930s war train, he admonishes his troops,""conscience is but a word cowards use.""  In case you are curious, the""a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse"" speech is delivered in abroken down jeep.       The best part of the entire movie are the sets by Tony Burrough.The Tower of London is transformed into a dim and damp basement full ofoverhead pipes and harsh lights.  When he chooses a real set, he usesthe Crystal Place at Brighton which is as close to an unreal real setthat you can get.  The best set is the one for the party rally.  It isa direct copy of that from Leni Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL whichcovered Hitler's 1935 Nazi party congress.       The wide variety of costumes (Shuna Harwood) range from armyuniforms reminiscent of the Nazis to lush clothing for teas full ofcream colors for the men and primary colors for the women.  Richard'smake-up (Pat Hay) has him with the required hunchback and a deformedleft arm and with a perfect little quasi-Hitlerian mustache.  Thecinematography (Peter Biziou) of hazy and shiny blues and greens withstrong flesh tones adds a feeling of death and conniving around everycorner.       The real Richard III died in the Battle of Bosworth Field.McKellen's ending is in a World War II battle complete with tanks andtremendous explosions.  The last scene with the loud Al Jolson musicis, well, a hoot.       RICHARD III runs a quick 1:45.  It is rated R for tastefully doneviolence, a little sex, very brief nudity, and one hard drug usagescene.  I am sorry to say that it has massive smoking for no purpose.This show would be fine for teenagers, and I would strongly encouragethem and anyone with an attention span longer than 15 seconds to seethis film.  It speaks to our time and every time.  I gladly give themovie *** 1/2. ",Richard III,R,1995,3.5
773,"      RICHIE RICH is a classic kid's tale retold and updated (read moreexpensive and elaborate toys) for the 90s.  We have the rich kid whohas everything.  In this case, it is everything electronic.  He ismissing only one thing in his life--friends.       Richie Rich (Macaulay Culkin) is worth $70,000,000,000 as he willbe the sole heir of the Richard Rich fortune.  His Mom (ChristineEbersole) and Dad (Edward Herrman) are classic Brady Bunch types exceptthey have enough money to buy an entire continent.  Perhaps, Bill Gateswill see this show and wonder if his kid in 10 years will be likethis.  Now, that does seem real, but I digress.       Unlike most zillionaires, the Rich family has hearts of gold.  HisDad has never laid off a single person in his entire vast empire.  Hewants to spend more money on factories and then give them to theworkers.       Of course, Richie is great in baseball having Reggie Jackson ashis personal coach.  When he sees a group of street kids from the localfactory that his Dad owns, he wants to play with them, but the feelingis not mutual.  In the classic story, he would want to be one of them.Not here.  In this show, he likes his million-dollar gadgets and wouldnever consider wanting to be anything other than super rich.  He doeswant to invite them over to his house to play.       The reason to see the show has nothing to do with the silly plotabove which goes on and on.  The reason is a lot of extremelyimaginative toys.  I could never describe them.  It is in the visualsthat they are interesting.  One is a million dollar mechanical andelectronic bee.  Sounds boring, but it is quite fanciful.  Sad to sad,that the electronic toys and the goodie goodie family are not enough tocarry the movie.       On the bad side, why o' why do we have to have the bad guys shootat the Rich's with big realistic handguns?  Why do we have to have apowerful laser cannon that would have been useful in Dessert Stormfired at them?  They have no place in a kids' movie.  These scenes scaredmy son (almost 6) a lot, and he sat in my lap and hid his eyes duringthem.       Also, on a small note, why did they put so much lipstick on Culkinin some of the scenes?  I understand the greasy kid hairdo, but not thelipstick.  I know his lips are red, but not that red.       The show is a mixed bag.  It has great gadgets, and is mostly aclassic kid's fable a la the Brothers Grimm.  The scene where theyteach all of the future CEOs at huge desks set up classroom style isreally cute.  On the other hand, we have all of those guns and theoverall silliness of the show.       In the end I gave the movie a thumbs down.  My son said ""it wasgood and not so good,"" and he gave it a thumbs sideways.  The movieruns too long at 1:35, but does have a nice Road Runner cartoon onbefore it.  It is incorrectly rated PG.  For all of that realisticshooting, I would rate it PG-13.  Be careful about taking kids under 7or 8 as it may scare them.  I give the movie * 1/2--mainly for thetoys. ",Richie Rich,PG,1994,1.5
774,"""I screwed up,"" admits Drew Barrymore as Beverly Donofrio, a waywardteen who desperately wants to go to college but refuses to heed her policemandad's advice to ""Keep your mind on books, not boys."" Indeed, when her unplannedbaby is born, her disappointed father (James Woods) murmurs to the swaddlednewborn: ""Your mother's 15. Your father's a moron - and they want me tocelebrate?"" Despite the fact that she's a self-centered, self-indulgent,self-destructive mother, showing a callous lack of responsibility, the boy growsup to be a precociously bright, charming, well-adjusted child (Logan Lerman) andthen young man (Adam Garcia). Aging on-screen from 15 to 36, Drew Barrymoreobviously relishes wallowing in the faults and foibles of her unsympatheticcharacter but, as her drug-addicted slacker husband, Steve Zahn delivers themost memorable performance, followed by Brittany Murphy as her best-friend.James Woods is convincing as the stern yet loving father and Lorraine Bracco issimply a cipher as her mother. Adapted by Morgan Upton Ward from BeverlyDonofrio's autobiography, the script awkwardly skips backwards - then forwards -in time, creating disjointed anecdotal fragments which even Penny Marshall'scomedic direction cannot overcome. What does succeed is Bill Groom's meticulousproduction design which flawlessly evokes working-class Wallingford, CT, in the'60s, even though it was filmed near Upsala College in East Orange, New Jersey.On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Riding in Cars With Boys"" is aninfuriating 5, unless you go for perpetually crying chicks and a maudlin,happily-ever-after excuse for teenage pregnancy. ",Riding In Cars with Boys,PG-13,2001,2.5
775," People who enjoy science fiction are often faced withunpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling ofnovels, stories, comic books or movies. Often sciencefiction aficionados find material, previously labelled asscience fiction, to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror,or rather simple techno-thriller. In such cases, mistakesare understandable - genre boundaries are never clearlymarked. But, I believe there are really few cases when amovie labelled as science fiction actually happens to bestraight historical epic. Such thing occurred in formerYugoslavia some fifteen years ago, when nationaldistributors gave such treatment to THE RIGHT STUFF, 1983film directed by Philip Kaufman.  The mistake of the distributors could be explained with thefact that the official poster of the film features men inspace suits. But THE RIGHT STUFF film isn't even fiction. Itwas based on the non-fiction book by Tom Wolfe, covering theearly years of American space program. The plot of the filmbegins in 1947 when few people heard of Edwards Air ForceBase, major test site for experimental planes. The major aimof test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraftto reach 1 Mach speed and thus break the sound barrier. Manypilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with theirlives for such bravado. But one quiet pilot, Chuck Eager(played by Sam Shaped) succeeds and thus gives example forwhole new generation of test pilots, determined to enterhistory books by breaking new speed records. Ten yearslater, Soviets have launched ""Sputnik"" marking the beginningof the Space Age. In order to regain national prestige, USgovernment decides to be the first to send man into space.Best Air Force, Navy and Marine pilots are recruited intoprogram, but not Yeager, because he lacks college educationand desired all-American image.  In one of critics' polls THE RIGHT STUFF was named as oneamong top 10 films made in 1980s. Such high position couldbe explained with the fact that Kaufman's film looks quiteatypical for its time. With more than three hours of lengthand epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s -age when Hollywood used to make films larger than life. Butthe real reason lies in the fact that it was made by trulyremarkable and talented filmmaker. Philip Kaufman createdreputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of thatGolden Age in order to create original, memorable movies.THE RIGHT STUFF was the last of them, swan song of an erawhen producers allowed directors to spend big bucks onunusual, risk-taking ""artsy"" projects.  THE RIGHT STUFF is unusual because it lacks many standardelements of Hollywood film. The plot is almost non-existentand not very coherent; the story, featuring many interestingincidents and anecdotes, shifts focus from the oldgeneration of test pilots, embodied in Yeager, to newgeneration of the astronauts. The film also lacksconventional protagonist - Yeager (who also appears in smallcameo) remains the true hero of the film, but equal time andexposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives,making this movie into ensemble piece. That gave opportunityfor Kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents, untilthat specialised only for bit or character roles. SamShepard is great as Yeager, war hero whose greatestachievement - breech of the sound barrier - remainedobscured in history books, probably due to his own modesty.On the surface, he lacks personality compared with his hypedand more fortunate astronaut colleagues, but Shepard givestexture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases.Shepard's performance is followed with great acting by EdHarris as clean-cut Marine (and future politician) JohnGlenn. Young Dennis Quaid is more than fine as arrogantfighter jock Gordo Cooper, and this arrogance is mirrored inhis friend and most tragic figure of Virgil Grissom,superbly played by Fred Ward. Always reliable characteractor Scott Glenn provides some comic relief as Navy aviatorand (arguably) first American man in space Alan Shepard.Kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - BarbaraHershey, Pamela Reed, Veronica Cartwright and Mary JoDeschanel are great as pilots' wives. Royal Dano is alsoimpressive as menacing figure of Preacher, but the mostmemorable performances belong to Donald Moffat asVice-President Lyndon B. Johnson and Jane Dornacker as NurseMurch.  Great acting talent assembled for this film was mirroredwith Kaufman's superb direction. Most notable of all is themethods Kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage oftime. The beginning of the film shows test pilots living inthe middle of desert, as virtual unknowns, far away fromstrict rules and discipline. Everything seems natural-Yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yardsaway from the fastest and most precious aircraft in theworld. In that setting, it's quite normal for importanttechnical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and forthe test pilots not to report their ribs being broken beforemost important flights. But the times are changing; WW2alliance with USSR is replaced with Cold War, and ""natural""pilots like Yeager must be replaced with more disciplined,conventional pilots. Their entire lives become focus ofmedia frenzy, and their job is subjected to strict rules,meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats,publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists (likeformer Nazi rocket expert Werner von Braun, played by ScottBeach) only to preserve their most basic human dignity. Thiscontrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence- while Yeager conducts his final and most spectacular testflight in absolute obscurity, ""Mercury"" astronauts receivefame and fortune, although some of them even before going inthe space.  Those contrasts and similar effects are achieved withKaufman's superb use of poetic movie language. Editing isgreat, and photography by Caleb Deschanel provides manymemorable scenes like the funeral in the desert orastronauts in their suits walking in slow motion (the sameimage would be copied in many latter films). AlthoughKaufman enjoyed support of NASA and American military, whichprovided authentic locations and period equipment, he stillhad to use special effects in order to simulate spaceflights. Those effects are excellent and they can still foolthe audience accustomed to CGI and real footage of Earthfrom outer space. Another fine contribution of this film is""Oscar""-awarded musical score by Bill Conti; I still tremblefrom excitement every time I hear it. It is accompanied withthe use of Holst and Debussy. Some of the songs used in thebackground also provide authentic atmosphere of thehistorical period.  This film is great, and its cult status is well deserved,but there are some minor flaws. Some of the ""Mercury""astronauts aren't fleshed out enough (although being playedby fine actors, like Lance Henriksen). Film also lacksproper closure. On the other hand, most logical conclusionof the film - landing on the Moon - would require this filmto be more than six hours long. Also, some critics wereprone to attack this film as too Amerocentric and hard onRussians, who were portrayed as evil monsters, just in linewith most virulent Cold War rhetoric of Reagan's America. Insome of contemporary interviews, Kaufman defended thatapproach by claiming that he wanted to make film asauthentic as possible, and in order to do that, he portrayedRussians not as they were in real life, but as they wereperceived by Americans in early 1960s.  Time has passed; now we don't see astronauts as heroes. Inthis age of widespread satellite communications and routinespace missions, those men and women in space suits are seenas mere maintenance workers. Few young boys want to beastronauts when they grow up. But this film, sentimentalreminder of the times ""when future began"", perhaps couldencourage at least some of them to follow ""Mercury""astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky. Andeven if they decide to stay on Earth, they could stillappreciate THE RIGHT STUFF as an extraordinary piece ofcinema. ","Right Stuff, The",PG,1983,4
776," ""Ringmaster,"" the film debut of controversial talk show host Jerry Springer (who also produces), is an uproarious, raunchy comedy that is much better than I expected it would be, not to mention funnier, but a film that didn't seem to add up to much when it was all over.  The film wisely does not focus on Springer (who actually is the blandest character here), but on two groups of lower-class people that are thrilled to get to go on the ""Jerry"" show. The first group is a bunch of white trash living in a trailer park. Angel (Jamie Pressly), a slutty 19-year-old, works as a maid for a motel by day (and who services the customers, as well), and in the evening carries on an affair with her stepfather (Michael Dudikoff), much to the chargin' of her equally promiscuous mother (Molly Hagan). The second group of people is a feisty black woman named Starletta (Wendy Raquel Robinson) who is angered at her cheating ""dog"" boyfriend (Michael Jai White). When both groups are accepted on the show, they come into contact with each other, in more than one sense of the word, while at their all-expenses-paid hotel.  ""Ringmaster,"" is far superior than I had expected because the film wisely centered on the characters, rather than Jerry, and it did a pretty good job of telling both of their stories. All actors, who are mostly unknowns, did a servicable job in their rather thankless roles, and Wendy Raquel Robinson, as Starletta, was, by far, the standout. In every single scene she was in, I couldn't help but laugh at her endless energy and hilarious dialogue. Also added to the comic relief of her character was her beloved hair piece, which goes through quite a lot during the duration of the film! I also liked Molly Hagan, as the mother of Angel, who is not a very happy woman, due to the fact that she is getting older, and nothing seems to be going right for her.  The interactions between all of the characters was entertaining and consistently comical, with a rather heavy dose of tastlessness. Where, ""Ringmaster,"" ran into problems, I think, was simply in the slight story, which is pretty forgettable, and in the climax, in which drama and moralizing takes over. Although there is a surprisingly truthful conversation between Pressly and Hagan late in the picture, a final speech given by Springer rang totally false. It was as if Springer wanted to tell the world a meaningful reason why he has stuck with his show for so long, when everyone knows it is only because it is outrageous and he has fun with it. His reasoning goes no further than that, and so his speech really put a damper on the fast and humorous pace that came before.  What it all comes down to is that, ""Ringmaster,"" is an overall fun way to spend an hour and a half, but it is nothing special.

777,"The road to perdition is paved with good intentions, and whatbetter intention can a father have than to protect his young boy? In David Self's adaptation of the Max Allan Collins novel, TomHanks performs in the role of Michael Sullivan, a hit man for theIrish mob in Chicago during the Depression year of 1931.  Thechoice of Sam Mendes as its director must have been a nobrainer, since the fellow who led ""American Beauty"" to tophonors as a drama of a dysfunctional suburban family could nothave been wiser: ""Road to Perdition"" may be a gangster movie,but this is primarily an unusual, poignant, and powerful coming-of-age story about a man who is a hero to his boy, a son heinsists must never follow the road that he took for himself in life. While Mendes's main interest is the relationship of Sullivan tohis son, Michael Jr. (played by 13-year-old newcomer TylerHoechlin who got the job after an audition of 2,000adolescents), some balance is achieved by contrasting anotherpair, gang kingpin John Rooney (Paul Newman) with his grownson and aspiring honcho, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig).  Thereis a third relationship of this nature as well, an implicit father-sonbond between Michael Sullivan and John Rooney (PaulNewman), the man who figuratively saved Sullivan's life duringour nation's most difficult economic times by giving him a houseand money and who treated his hit man as though he were hisown son.     After introducing the relationship of the various characters at awake for one of the mob showing John Rooney to have thecharisma made him the patriarch of the Irish mob in the Chicagoarea-- Mendes takes us to a frightening scene in which thethirteen-year old Michael, hiding in a trunk in the back seat of acar, stealthily witnesses his dad and others perform a hit on aman unable to pay his debt to the mob. Seen immediatelythereafter by the gangsters, young Michael is sworn to secrecy,but his dad suspects rightly so that the boy's life is in danger, atheory confirmed when one of Rooney's mob enters the Sullivanhome and guns down Michael Sr.'s wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and her other son, Peter (Liam Aiken).  Having experienced thebetrayal of his life by the man who has treated him like a son,Sullivan is now bent on revenge but most of all on protecting hisson, whose life is in danger as well as his own.  He is pursuedby Maguire (Jude Law), a press photographer doubling as a hitman,  who has been hired track down and to kill MichaelSullivan.     The film has several scenes remarkable in theirunpredictability, the best in my view occurring in a roadsidediner in the middle of nowhere on a snow-filled night whenMaguire has successfully found Sullivan getting some foodwhile driving his son to an aunt's home by the sea.  Not realizingwho the man is, Sullivan gets into a conversation with the dinerat the next table little appreciating that this may be the last chathe will have in this life.       While there are fine performances all around including onewith Al Capone's first lieutenant, Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci, fittedup with a terrific hairpiece) Jude Law's is the most memorable. His smashing good looks converted into that of an ordinary-looking fellow with yellowing and rotting teeth and a pale skin,Law is the essence of cool, providing some of the film's humoras he takes the photo of a man he has just shot, who lies on thefloor dying and hears the photograph gently say, ""Smile!""  Entireblocks are filled with vintage automobiles, Care has apparentlybeen taking with the wardrobe, as designer Albert Wolskycreated fabrics that are much heavier than today's fashions andlie on the men's bodies in a different way from today's Armanis.Conrad L. Hall avoids the usual sepia photography associatedwith period pieces of this sort while retaining a noirish look witha tilt toward the monochromatic.      So move over, ""Godfather.""  ""Road to Perdition"" not onlyevokes the concept of The Mob as a business, a corporationwith a board of directors, the promotion of the most competentpeople and the sudden disappearance of those who have lostfavor: this year's entry combining the always fascinating saga ofDepression-year mobsters and coming-of-age theme is a potentone, entering the market surprisingly during this mostly fluffysummer season to share with ""Minority Report"" the status ofnear masterwork. ",Road To Perdition,R,2002,3.5
778,"One of the things that distinguish modern industrial societies fromthose in the past is the decline of the traditional religion. Thisdecline manifests itself in the decreased role of religion as acohesive factor of society, as well as the disappearance of religionas an important factor in lives of its individual members. Thatdoesn't mean that the religion as a concept disappeared from thesociety entirely. It simply took new forms, and some of those formsseem to reflect materialistic worldview and values that are sodominant in today's world. The best example could be found in thecults that try to give solution to individual's problems by promotingphysical health instead of spiritual values. Those cults usually offersimple formulas for keeping people healthy.  Those formulas oftenforce people to base their entire lifestyle around them and makesacrifices not unlike those of hermits and similar religiousdevotees. Because of that, health cults could have provided afertile ground for sociological comments and satire, but Hollywoodwas very reluctant to enter this area. One of those rare exceptionsis THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE, 1994 period comedy written anddirected by Alan Parker.  The plot of the film, based on the novel by T. Corghessan Boyle,combines fiction with history in order to tell the tale about thegreat-granddaddy of all modern-day health cults. In the beginningof 20th Century Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (played by AnthonyHopkins), famous physician, nutritionist and the inventor ofcornflake, has established the sanatorium in Battle Creek,Michigan. Rich patients go there to test Kellogg's recipes for ahealthy life, but at least one of them, William Lightbody (played byMatthew Broderick) would see that healthy life isn't necessarily apleasant one. Kellogg subjects his patients to various torture-likeexercise and enemas five times a day and demands totalabstinence from meat, tobacco, alcohol and sex. Lightbody isaccompanied by his young wife Eleanor (played by Bridget Fonda)and both of them, unable to abstain from sex, indulge in adultery.In the meantime, Kellogg's adopted son George (played by DanaCarvey) conspires with his father's competition in order to stealthe formula for cornflakes.  Thing that separates THE ROAD TO WELVILLE from most of 1990sHollywood comedies is its use of toilet humour. Hardly any film,even the most infamous gross-out comedies of our day, featuressuch amount of excrement like this one; yet the humour derivedfrom such display of various bodily fluids is entirely within thecontext of the film and its use is quite justified. Unfortunately, theamount and graphic nature of such scenes might not be suitablefor the viewers with weaker stomachs; yet those who are able todeal with initial shock would be awarded with few hilarious scenes.The real problem with THE ROAD WITH WELLVILLE is more of aform than of content. The plot is too loose and episodic and themovie is overlong.  On the other hand, great length is also an opportunity for castingwide variety of talented actors. Anthony Hopkins leads the packand shows that he could deal with comedic as well as dramaticroles. He is almost unrecognisable with the rabbit-like face of Dr.Kellogg and he does everything in his power to make thischaracter as cartoonish as possible. Hopkins is so delightfullyover-the-top in his efforts that the viewers might forget that thesame actor won ""Oscar"" few years earlier by playing anotherphysician (those who don't might find Dr. Kellogg to be muchscarier, in some way). There are plenty of other actors - Britishand Americans - and few are as effective as Hopkins, includingrather bland Matthew Broderick who plays movie's nominalprotagonist. Other performances would be stand out for entirelydifferent reasons, including Lara Flynn Boyle whose character isturning green. Parker's direction, while not sparing viewers fromthe disturbing banality of human metabolism, tries to compensatepotential unpleasantness by creating vivid period atmosphere. Inthat he was aided by Rachel Portman, composer specialised forperiod dramas.  At times disturbing, at times overlong, and at times unfunny, THEROAD TO WELVILLE might not be for everyone, yet for those whocan handle uncompromising satire, this film might be experiencequite different from its seemingly unpleasant content. ","Road To Wellville, The",R,1994,2

But it's notas good as ""American Pie"" or ""There's Something About Mary."" And it'snot as funny as ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" or ""Porky's.""Breckin Meyer stars as Josh, who's been in love with Tiffany (RachelBlanchard) since they were kids. He's committed to her - except for acollege fling with sexually aggressive Beth (Amy Smart). But hisinfidelity was recorded on videotape - and that tape has beenaccidentally mailed to Tiffany. Which necessitates a spontaneous,desperate three-day, 1,800-mile road trip from Ithaca, New York, toAustin, Texas, to intercept the incriminating sexcapade and save hisromance. He's accompanied by his bumbling best-friend, played by SeannWilliam Scott, plus pot-smoking Paulo Costanzo and the requisitenerdy-guy-with-the-car, DK Qualls. So much for plot. MTV comedian TomGreen serves as the cryptic narrator/tour guide named BarryManilow.

780,"      As in EXECUTIVE DECISION, we have another movie where part of theentire country may die, but the President is basically AWOL and hisaides and the military brass handle all the decisions.  This film iscalled THE ROCK and rather than wipe out a mass of humanity withnuclear weapons, this time it is chemical weapons so lethal than ateaspoon in the air kills everyone in an eight block radius.  To getlarge audiences these days you must threaten the lives of hundreds ofthousands, a couple of dozen I guess is considered passe.       In an extremely well cast movie we have Ed Harris playing themajor bad guy, U. S. Brigadier General Francis Xavier Hummel.  Ofcourse, it is our government and not him to blame.  As he explains it,""The men in military special ops are selected to carry out illegaloperations throughout the world.   When they don't come home, theirfamilies are told fairy tales about what happened and deniedcompensation.  All my career I've choked on these lines.   Well, hereand now the lies stop.""  Later he quotes Thomas Jefferson in justifyinghis behavior saying, ""The tree of liberty from time to time must bewatered by the blood of patriots.""       General Hummel turns a bunch of our soldiers into mercenaries.They kill large numbers of people securing the chemical weapons calledV. X. nerve gas.  Once they have it, they take over Alcatraz.  Whileholding 81 hostages there, they position four rockets to fire V. X.over San Francisco unless they get $100,000,000 in 40 hours.  LikeRobin Hood, they are only going to keep part of loot and give the restto the relatives of soldiers who have died in other covert missions.       The best part of the show is Nicolas Cage as Dr. StanleyGoodspeed, a chemical and biological weapons expert, and Sean Conneryas John Patrick Mason, a non-person who once escaped from The Rock.Mason was in the British secret service, but did something that causedour government to incarcerate him for the rest of his life in totalsecrecy.  The only problem is that he is an escape specialist and keepsbreaking out of the prisons where he is put.  They let him out ofprison so he can help them sneak into The Rock with a special forcesteam.       Before Goodspeed and Mason go to The Rock for the big rescue, theyhave an excessively long car chase through the streets of SanFrancisco.  In this highly derivative film the writers try for a smalltwist by having it be a yellow Ferrari chasing a Hummer.  Among otherover the top special effects we have a cable car blown straight in theair and fly over head.  The director (Michael Bay) looks like he hadtoo much money and wanted to spend it all.  As I was having fun, I keptthinking of all of the great films made with small budgets that havesomething to say and yet it is these, admittedly enjoyable, escapistentertainment pictures that bring out the crowds.       The script by Douglas S. Cook, John Hensleigh, and David Weisbergis preposterous and overly dramatic, but funny.  Typical of the humoris an interchange between an exhausted Goodspeed and Mason during oneof the action scenes.  Goodspeed asks, ""You enjoying this?""  Masonsmiling says, ""Well it's certainly better than my average day, readingShakespeare and avoiding gang rape in the washroom.""  When they finallyget to Alcatraz, Mason starts droning on about the prison's past.  Thisirritates Goodspeed who tells him, ""I like history too.  Maybe whenthis is over we can to the souvenir shop.  Right now I want to findsome rockets.""  Finally, Mason explains his qualifications as, ""I havea unique knowledge of this prison facility.  I was formerly a guesthere.""       Beside the excellent acting by the three leads.  There are scoresand scores of good actors in minor roles, including, but not limited toCommander Anderson (Michael Biehn), Eddie Paxton (William Forsythe),Major Tom Baxter (David Morse), FBI Director Womack (John Spencer),Captain Hendrix (John C.  Mcginley), Captain Darrow (Tony Todd),Sergeant Crisp (Bokeem Woodbine), Special Agent Shepard (Danny Nucci),and Captian Frye (Gregory Sporleder).       The editing (Richard Francis-Bruce) is too choppy in thebeginning, but the cinematography (John Schwartzman) is strikingthroughout.  The San Francisco scenes have lush, bright colors and theAlcatraz ones are full of a warm radiance.  If anything, they make theprison seem almost too pretty.  There are a few cute cinematographictricks.  The most dramatic is the quick cut to an extreme close up of aspinning quarter.       THE ROCK runs about 2 hours.  It is rated R.  There is a littlesex, no nudity, a fair amount of bad language, and lots of gory deaths.It would fine for most teenagers.  As an action film, this moviedelivers the goods, but the best part is the acting.  This is a wellmade piece of escapism that I recommend to you, but warn you not tomake the mistake of engaging your brain during the show.  Go with theflow and you will enjoy it. ","Rock, The",R,1996,3
781,"Dylan Kidd may be a first-time director but while direction is nota particularly strong point in ""Roger Dodger,"" the script is a first-rate, cynical dissertation on the sexual wars.  The openingconversation around a table at a bar holding the boss andemployees of a crackerjack New York ad agency, is so sharp thata typical arthouse patron might even think back to David Hare's""The Designated Mourner,"" except that this time the topic is notso trivial as the Death of Culture but the far more important one:Sex.  To Roger Swanson (Campbell Scott), the pursuit of sex isas exciting as the hunt is to the deer slayer: we get theimpression by the final scene of this 105-minute theatricalpiece in which Mr. Kidd attempts throughout to one-up Neil LaBute for nastiness that the chase is more important than thereward.  Consider how unsuccessful Roger is in gaining hisalleged objective and how competent he is as a silver-tonguedorator who could out-debate Johnny Cochran and who seems toexpand his social vocabulary with every puff of his omnipresentcigarette. With a theme redolent of the musical ""Auntie Mame,"" RogerDodger introduces a 16-year-old Ohio resident, Nick (JesseEisenberg), who makes a surprise visit on his uncle Roger justafter the former's interview for a place at Columbia University.  Thedifference is that Roger does not treat his nephew as an underagekid who must be protected from four-letter words and the sex actitself but as a student of physical love to whom he condescendsonly occasionally, at other times treating him almost like anequal.  When Roger is not making the scene with his boss at thead agency, Joyce (Isabella Rossellini) who despite her extrayears feels free to collect younger men at her ad agency liketrophies only to dispense with them when she's bored he's doingthe bars, trying to prove to the teen that he scores ""every night."" Roger, though, gets his nickname because apparently he'd ratherdodge the women he meets after hitting on them, presumablybecause he has the same contempt for women that a pimp hasfor his stable. ""Roger Dodger"" is a nasty movie, which is all to its credit,though one which does not really gather steam as it progresses. Nothing in the story quite matches the opening gambit with hisboss and colleagues as he entertains them with a vision of thenear future in which not only will men  become obsolete except forlifting couches, but sperm itself will no longer be necessary forprocreation.   Campbell Scott is vastly entertaining in a story thatyou'd most likely find on the off-Broadway stage but which worksfine on the screen despite Kidd use of natural light which keepsmost of the scenes pretty dark as though to match theprotagonist's own in-the-dark mentality about the opposite sex. With the exception of Isabella Rossellini who cannot matchScott Campbell's dialogue for wit and cynicism but can onlyrespond with some cleverness to his repartee Dylan Kidd'swomen are strictly supporting players some barflies like Andrea(Elizabeth Berkley) and Sophie (Jennifer Beals), others theresimply to allow Roger to insult them for their advancing age.  Inone of Roger Dodger's most prescient adages, that the purpose ofadvertising is ""thinking up ways to make people feel bad? (andpromising that its products would fulfill the gaps), just think of howmany movies with sexy stars make us feel inadequate.  We don'tlook like them, we cannot attract others the way they can, wedon't have the incredible orgasms that they appear to enjoy. What should we do to fulfill ourselves?  Ask Roger.

782,"""Rollerball,"" a remake of the 1975 cult actioner starring James Caan,was to be one of last summer's tentpole releases. Then word got outfrom test audiences and film critic Harry Knowles that it wasn't justmisguided, but terrible. Knowles went on to say that its one savinggrace was the graphic, bone-crunching, over-the-top violence seenin the sports sequences. MGM and director John McTiernan (1999's ""The13th Warrior"") promptly pulled the film from its target August releasedate to do re-shoots and some extensive re-editing. They apparentlydidn't listen to Knowles' sole compliment to the picture, as theyalso have cut out all of the blood and nudity that were its apparentdistinguishable qualities, turning a hard R-rating into a PG-13. Whilethe added violence might have made the updated ""Rollerball"" more memorable,no amount of changes could have saved the film from its fate as atruly despicable motion picture. After a thrillingly executed bodysurfing race through the streetsof San Francisco that has nothing to do with anything that follows,the action relocates to the country of Kazakhstan in central Asia.It is here that an extreme sport that mixes rollerblading, motorcycling,and steel ball-throwing--known as Rollerball--is gaining worldwide viewership.  Jonathan Cross (Chris Klein) is one of the newest players, a fresh-facedingenue who has turned to Rollerball after plans to play in the NHLfell through. Jonathan is best friends with Marcus Ridley (LL CoolJ), and is having a secret affair with Aurora (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos),both fellow players. When a string of accidents during the games beginpopping up, Aurora suspects that it is team manager and rollerballinventor Petrovich (Jean Reno) who is behind this conspiracy of escalatingdanger simply to attract more viewers. Worse, she has reason to believethat Jonathan may be next on his hit list. Save for the aforementioned prologue in San Francisco and a notablyfine performance by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (2000's ""X-Men""), ""Rollerball""is a shameful exercise in laughable dialogue, incoherent storytelling,jarringly choppy editing, and a directing effort from veteran JohnMcTiernan that would lead one to believe he had never picked up acamera prior to shooting. >From the opening scene to the last, the film is a 99-minute musicvideo where hard rock and heavy metal unrelentingly blast on the soundtrack,drowning out some of the dialogue exchanges (when you're lucky) andwithout a care in the world for the actual plot. Music videos canbe fun to watch, and so can theatrical trailers (basically music videosthemselves), but it is not fun to waste nearly two hours of your lifewatching something so joyless, amateurish, and mean-spirited as ""Rollerball.""The characters are practically nonexistent, too, thrown so far tothe wayside that no one gets more than a single dimension (and sometimesnone at all), and no relationships are developed outside of theirperfunctory requirements. McTiernan's idea of a powerful romance,for example, is having a naked Romijn-Stamos walk over to Klein andstuff his face into her breasts, only to promptly cut to the next scene. The three key Rollerball sequences admittedly have the potential tobe alluring and entertaining in a trashy way, but in molding the finalfilm into a PG-13 rating, they are so haphazardly edited that it isbut a jumble of images that don't seem to add up into a whole. Wortha laugh are the scenes where characters bleed, as the blood has beendigitally altered to look like brown, liquidized dirt. An elongatedaction scene set in the desert midway through has, for no discerniblereason, been shot with a night-vision camera and no lighting equipment,making the image grainy and green-toned. This oddball stylistic decisionis, coincidentally, the least of this film's problems. The actors have all done respectable work in the past, and they willno doubt do good work in the future, but they have sold themselvesshort this time around. Chris Klein (2001's ""American Pie 2""), asstar player Jonathan Cross, plays his slim role like a good, ol' boytrying to act tough, and failing. One scene where he is required tohave a five o'clock shadow is humorous for the very fact that he isso baby-faced. LL Cool J (1999's ""Any Given Sunday"") has even lessto do as Marcus Ridley, a totally superfluous character. And JeanReno (2001's ""Just Visiting"") snarls embarrassingly and does nothingbut, as the maniacal Petrovich. The screenplay for ""Rollerball,"" by Larry Ferguson and John Pogue,is such a sloppy one (with some real dialogue howlers) that the studioexec who bought it must have been under a heavy dosage of hallucinogens.If the movie sounds so bad it's good, you'd be sorely mistaken. Wadingthrough this shoddy excuse for a big-budget action-thriller just fora momentary eye-roll is about as enjoyable, I would imagine, as searchingfor a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces. ""Rollerball"" is positively dreadful.",Rollerball,PG-13,2002,0.5
783,"      There is a scene in ROSEWOOD that captures the film's essence.One dark night, Mr. Mann is hiding in the lush green Florida brush.He stares in horror at the lynching in front of him.  Not content withmere lynching, the perpetrators light up the sky and Mr. Mann's facewith their shotgun blasts.  They are celebrating their triumphs andmutilating the body.  Mr. Mann's facial expressions alone say more thanthe entirety of many lesser movies.       BOYZ N THE HOOD director John Singleton brings a true story tolife with such immediacy that it grabs your heart and your mind.I think of him as a talky, action director, but the brilliance ofROSEWOOD happens in the silence.       The casting of the film is perfect.  Ving Rhames, in the lead roleof Mr. Mann, delivers a performance worthy of Oscar consideration.  HisMr. Mann is an heroic figure of almost mythic proportions, and yet heis both quite vulnerable and totally believable.  Mr. Mann reminds meof a statuesque and powerful hero from a Wagnerian opera.  Lohengrincomes to mind.       The incident dramatized in ROSEWOOD started on New Year's Eve in1922.  As the picture opens, a mysterious but powerful looking stranger(Mr. Mann) comes to a fork in the road.  He has to choose between twosmall Florida towns.  One sign points to the almost all black hamlet ofRosewood, where the land and houses are owned by the blacks.  The othersign points to Sumner, where the whites live and many of the blackswork.  He chooses Rosewood.       The only white resident of Rosewood is John Wright (Jon Voight),who owns the general store.  Voight gives a moving performance assomeone caught in the middle.  The anguish on his face and, again, hissilent moments are almost as strong as those of Rhames.  Wright and hisfamily are also the only sympathetic white people in the story.  Eventhe names of the two leads, which in the movie sound like ""Mr. Man"" and""Mr. Right"", have a force of their own.       (The whole Rosewood tragedy came to light in 1993 with sworndepositions from the residents of the time.  More documentation on theevent can be found on the Web.  I will assume that the film isaccurate, but I know most filmmakers take varying degrees of licensewith purportedly true stories.  Nevertheless, based on what I haveread, I believe most of it is true.)       I am inclined to keep the facts of the incident to a minimum sothat you can be as affected and moved by the film as was I.  Suffice itto say that people are lynched and murdered.  Overall the feeling leftwith this critic is that I had just seen a small version of an AmericanKrystalnacht.  Unlike the German Krystalnacht, this one had beencovered up for years.  I don't believe this was due to any conspiracy.Rather I attribute this lack of publicity on the Rosewood incident tothe reticence of the people at the time to admit to what had happened,the whites for fear of prosecution and the blacks for fear of reprisal.       Gregory Poirier's richly textured script is incredible.  Itmanages to populate the film with as many people as a Tolstoy novel andstill develop them enough so that you know and care about a myriad ofcharacters.  His script engulfs the audience in a wide range ofemotions from fear to anger to pity.  I will never forget the fatherteaching his young son the proper way to make a rope for lynching.       An easy mistake to make would have been for Singleton to craft anultra-violent diatribe against racism, thus making a statement andlittle more.  Instead he created a beautiful film that takes the timeto introduce us to the black families and culture of that era.  Anotherresult of the film then has to be respect and appreciation for the goodaspects of a period in black history rarely seen in the cinema.  Theresidents of Rosewood formed a tightly knit community that owned theirown land and generally were model citizens.       If there is a single part of the picture that stands out more thanany other, it has to be Johnny E. Jensen's cinematography.  Using apalette of warm browns and oranges he magnifies the story's hope andmisery.  Best are the scenes in which figures are backlit, but all ofthe images of Mr. Mann are worth mounting and framing.       When I tell you that STAR WARS composer John Williams did thescore, what do you think it sounds like?  Well, you are wrong.  It ismore intimate than overpowering and quite delicate.       The supporting cast is so talented that I have trouble decidingwhom to mention.  Let me just say that it includes: Don Cheadle, LorenDean, Catherine Kellner, Bruce McGill, Elise Neal, Esther Rolle, andMichael Rooker.       After many surprises, the show finally ends on a hopeful note.I left feeling privileged to have seen this film.  Mr. Mann and theresidents of Rosewood are people I will forever respect.  And thehorrors inflicted upon them are something I will not forget.       ROSEWOOD runs too long at 2:19.  Trimming it some would have madethe film more focused and effective.  ROSEWOOD is rated R for violenceand sex.  There are some pretty intensely violent scenes, but none aresensationalized.  The show is important so it is my fond hope that mostparents will take their teenagers to see it.  There not that manygraphic scenes -- just tell them to shut their eyes if they need to.I strongly recommend the picture to you and give it *** 1/2. ",Rosewood,R,1997,3.5
784," ""Rounders"" offers an interesting look into the world of high-stakes poker, as well as some very good acting from Matt Damon, Edward Norton and Martin Landau. Unfortunately, the film lacks a compelling story arc, credible interpersonal relationships and characters that grow or change. As a result it feels incomplete, as if we're watching a filmed version of the first or second draft of a story rather than the finished product.  Establishing a conspiratorial tone with low-key voice-over narration, professional card player Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) ushers us into the smoky netherland of illicit poker that flourishes in musty back rooms of old buildings, protected by thick doors and beefy security guards. According to Mike, success as a rounder comes as much from reading the body language of an opponent as it does from the cards he holds.  After losing a whopping $30,000 during one bad night, Mike swears off the game and focuses on his legal studies, to the great relief of his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol). The future looks bright until nine months later, when Mike's best friend Worm (Edward Norton) emerges from prison with a rakish smile on his face and a heavy gambling debt on his back. Within a short period of time, Mike is in the game again, with his relationship and studies in shambles and a major portion of Worm's debt on his own shoulders. To save their collective asses and assets, Mike must play the game like he has never played before.  Matt Damon anchors ""Rounders"" with another rock solid performance. He possesses something magical that goes beyond his good looks and exceptional acting skills. When you study Damon's face you can instantly picture what he looked like as a child and what he will look like as an old man. There's an air of familiarity about him that's comforting; watching him onscreen is like visiting an old friend. The film's exploration of the gritty, exotic gaming underworld is even more engrossing with Damon as our tour guide.  The chameleon-like Edward Norton creates another riveting characterization in the jittery, impulsive Worm, who comes off like a younger version of ""Midnight Cowboy's"" Ratso Rizzo. But, as presented in this screenplay, Worm's relationship with Mike just doesn't ring true. We're told that they have been best friends since childhood, but together they're like oil and water. Worm isn't just reckless and compulsive; he is completely self-destructive and shows no hesitation in pulling Mike down with him. Surely his behavior would have destroyed their friendship long before the men reached their mid 20's.   To be sure, the incredible loyalty Mike displays for Worm doesn't extend to his girlfriend. He appears to have little problem breaking his promises to Jo, a stable woman who stuck with him even after he blew $30 grand, choosing instead to head out for a night of rounding with Worm. The relationships between all three characters are unconvincing, playing simply as contrivances of the screenwriters to get all the cast members into their proper positions for the card games.  Pity poor Gretchen Mol, stuck with an utterly thankless role. Her job is merely to simmer, cluck at her wayward boyfriend and look wounded. Although the acting credit will be nice for her r_sum_, the film would have played more honestly had it omitted the role completely and just cut to the chase.  As for the other supporting characters, Martin Landau gives a luminous performance as Mike's law professor and ersatz father figure. Projecting strength, grace and warmth beneath his frail, bird-like appearance, Landau is a wonder who gets better and better with each new film. John Turturro does solid work as a man who plays not for sport, but to support his family. And John Malkovich is fun as Mike's nemesis, employing a thick Russian accent in a hammy, but engaging performance.   Ultimately, ""Rounders"" is a minor pleasure. The glimpse into an exotic, edgy world is absorbing and the performances of Damon, Norton and Landau are rewarding, despite the shaky credibility of their characters' relationships. But ""Rounders"" is frustrating because it could have been so much more, had the writers only devoted more attention to the script. Oh well, I suppose with a film like this, you just have to play the cards you're dealt. ",Rounders,R,1998,3
785,"It's ""The Emperor's New Clothes."" Highly publicized as a hilarioushoot, this weird, tepid farce about an estranged, fractured family is one of themost thuddingly unfunny comedies of the season. As we're told by a narrator(Alec Baldwin), the children of Royal (Gene Hackman) and Etheline (AnjelicaHuston) were child prodigies. Raised in an imaginary Manhattan by their wealthymother, their genius deteriorated after they were abandoned by their father.After ""two decades of betrayal, failure and disaster,"" Chas (Ben Stiller), theolder son, a financial whiz, has become a bitter, paranoid widower with twoyoung look-alike/dress-alike sons, while the younger son Richie (Luke Wilson), aformer tennis ace, is a traumatized world-traveler who harbors a guilty secret.The adopted daughter Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), a promiscuous playwright, spendsher days sulking, locked in a bathroom, smoking, watching TV and soaking in atub, while Richie's best friend, Eli Cash (Owen Wilson, who co-wrote thescript), is a drug-addled successful novelist. Desperate to re-connect, they allmove back into the family mansion, including the sheepish wastrel Royal, whofakes terminal stomach cancer to get attention. Hovering around the peripheryare Etheline's suitor (Danny Glover), Margot's hapless husband (Bill Murray) andthe Indian butler (Kumar Pallana). Despite the presence of a talented actingensemble and David Wasco's clever production design, writer/director WesAnderson, who showed a risky originality with ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore,""misfires here. Whatever hostile, deadpan humor exists is so insular, soinaccessible as to be unfathomable. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""TheRoyal Tenenbaums"" is a bleak, brittle 4. To call it merely peculiar is a grossunderstatement. ","Royal Tenenbaums, The",R,2001,1.5
786,"      A RUN OF THE COUNTRY starts off as a little, light, slice of lifemovie, but by the end develops into full blown tragedy.  It opens withDanny's (Matt Keeslar) mom being put in the grave.  It then switches toa series of scenes of conflict between Danny and his father (AlbertFinney).  Whenever things get bad for Danny, he wistfully flashes backto happy times, laughing with his mother.       Danny's father is a police sergeant in a small town in Irelandnear the border with the North and hence near ""The Troubles.""  Hisfather wants to get a juicy murder that only he can solve, but the besthe can do is find people killed by the IRA.  He disgustedly remarks onone killing that ""This is a political murder, not an ordinary, decentcrime at all.""  Finney is equally disappointed with his son, reflectingthat ""He's a dreamer, but dreamers don't pay the rent.""       Danny soon gets feed up with his Dad who stays angry at him andwants him to make something of his life and ""go off to University"" soDanny leaves to stay with his friend Prunty known as Coco (AnthonyBrophy).  The Coco character is broadly drawn and soon becomes acaricature of a flaky friend.  His costumes and make up are reminiscentof a beggar in a Dickens play.  This character is badly written (ShaneConnaughton) and poorly acted.  Without him the movie would have beenmuch stronger.  A typical scene with him is the bar room brawl onewhere he picks a fight just for fun and people crawl under otherpeople's legs to escape.  Its been done a thousand times before andConnaughton's writing provides nothing fresh.       The director (Peter Yates) appears to encourage Finney to overactat first as the movie starts quite unevenly.  Eventually, Yates startsto provide focus and the movie comes into its own after meandering forabout 20 minutes with a fairly boring, semi-slapstick tone.  I wassurprised how quickly my opinion began to change from boredom to beingdrawn into the story.  The catalyst was the blossoming of the romancebetween Danny and his new girlfriend, Annagh Lee (Victoria Smurfit) wholives in Northern Ireland, but just a few miles from Danny's house.Smurfit is a first time movie actress that has a smile and a sense ofinner confidence that mesmerizes her audience.  Suddenly you care,because you want to be Danny.       At this point, I thought the movie was going to be a romance.Wrong.  Although the romance was wonderful and lasted for quite sometime, the film is ultimately a tragedy that may make tears come to youreyes.  From the first, where Annagh declares that ""You know our bodiesare just bags of fluid and bones.  I don't think we have a long termfuture on this planet"", you begin to sense an impending doom.  There isalso a little mystery along the way, but the writer telegraphs hispunches so well that most of the audience knows who it is.       For me the war part is an unnecessary complication, but I likedalmost all of the show.  My main criticism, other than the Cococharacter, is that I wish Yates had gone for either romance or tragedy,but not both.  It was almost like a two part Opera where the first actis all sweetness and light and the second all dark and foreboding.Nevertheless, I liked both parts.       The movie has fairly uninvolving cinematography which is a shamegiven the material they have to work with.  They filmed it on locationin County Cavan.  Only the ending vistas while the credits are rollingshows off Ireland at all.  The sound effects editing was especiallygood.  The way they work the natural animal sounds into it, you want togo live in a small village in the Irish countryside because it soundsso peaceful.       A RUN OF THE COUNTRY runs just about right at 1:50.  It is rated Rfor a little violence, some tasteful and beautifully done sex, and somemale and female nudity.  It is a soft R, and I think it would be finefor teenagers.  I recommend the movie to you, and I award it ** 1/2. ","Run of the Country, The",R,1995,2.5
787," Life follows art in one way that most viewers of ""TheRundown"" are probably not aware.  While the production teamscouted in and about the Brazilian Amazon city of Manaus, theywere held up by armed bandits, lost their money and camerasand equipment, and could have lost their lives if the local guidesdid not successfully plead for the safe release of the group.  InPeter Berg's movie, shot in Hawaii and written by R.J. Stewartand James Vanderbilt from a story by R.J. Stewart, a fatheroffers a tidy sum a ransom, if you will to a tough guy with aninterest in Italian cooking.  ""Bring back my son from the Amazonjungles of Brazil,"" he suggests, ""and I'll ove look your debt tome, give you a restaurant, and throw in ""250 large.""  That couldbuy quite a few cruzeiros, money that Beck (The Rock) coulduse, though he discovers that the young man who is the objectof the search, Travis (Seann William Scott), is out to find atreasure worth quite a bit more.  In a story that could have beeninspired by the Indiana Jones sub-genre, Travis seeks atreasure which in some mysterious way not precisely explained,would free the Indians from servitude to the mines owned by theimperialistic Hatcher (Christopher Walken).     Taking the final leg of his trip in a one-engine plane run byDeclan (Ewen Bremner from ""Trainspotting""), Beck finds the kideasily enough, but handcuffing him and ordering him into a truckthat would lead to the runway and a return to the States is notso easy.  Travis does not want to return nor should he beforced to, considering that he is not a minor subject to his dad'srule nor is Hatcher willing to release the lad from the area giventhe boy's knowledge of the hidden treasure that Hatcher couldfence for millions.     Many of the adventures that the two run into on their way northinclude conflicts with their human enemies, with hostilemonkeys baring animatronic teeth, and most of all with nature inthe form of explosive methane gas, landslides, and water.  Agood deal of the picture is taken up with fights usually won byBeck, including the night-club knocking out of an entire profootball defensive line which came to the defense of a fellowwho is owed a gambling debt, a setback in which Beck isknocked out not by people but by a fruit offered to him by thelocal barkeep, Mariana (Rosario Dawson), and a humiliatingseries of knockdowns at the hands and feet of an Indian kick-boxer who barely comes up to Beck's chest and tips the scalesat maybe half of what The Rock might weigh.     The highlight, a expected, is Sean William Scott in the role ofTravis, a performance not entirely different from his wise-assguise in the American Pie trilogy though in the jungles he has afour-day beard which seems not to grow even while handcuffedand presumably unable to use a razor.  The movie sticks to thesummer formula, coming alive principally when Scott issues hisbon mots though of less interest during the dizzying fast-editingso endemic to films involving hard physical conflict. ","Rundown, The",R,2003,2
788," After seeing ""American Beauty"" three years back, my colleagues and I had adiscussion over a Starbuck's about whether Sam Mendes' sophisticated look at theAmerican Dream gone sour could be considered an indictment of suburbia.  Whereelse would a woman be careful to weed her garden wearing gloves whose colorcomplimented the lawn?  Materialism itself was not really the question: theissue was whether living away from the glorious distractions of city life wasresponsibility for making a family self-absorbed and alienated from one another.Nobody really won that discussion, my opponents holding that the angst faced byKevin Spacey's character could be experienced anywhere.    The same question lies at the heart of Rose Troche's exquisitely performed ""TheSafety of Objects,"" based on a composite of short stories by A.M. homes, thecharacters welded together after a year's work by Rose Troche, who serves asscreenwriter as well. Favored by Geraldine Peroni's editing, ""The Safety ofObjects"" is the story of three families who live side by side in a modestAmerican suburb whose lives interweave during four days of crisis. These peopleare so pre-occupied you couldn't imagine their discussing President Bush'sMiddle East policy or domestic affairs particularly since their problems at homewould not be ameliorated even had they received generous tax breaks.  Though oneof the women is having financial problems that deprive her daughter of summercamp, for the most part even she is simply house-poor, surrounded like herneighbors with the accouterments of the good life.  A character-driven piece, Troche's film introduces Paul Gold (Joshua Jackson),now in a coma resulting from a car accident, whose profound disability is but anextreme extension of the stupor those who play out their days about him.  EstherGold (Glenn Close), for example, takes on the sole responsibility of nursing hercomatose son, all but ignored by her husband Howard (Robert Klein) as she, inturn, is forced to deny quality time to her daughter, Julie (Jessica Campbell). Neighbor Jim Train (Dermot Mulroney), a lawyer who has just been passed over fora promotion he felt certain to receive, all but freaks out, hanging out at themall to the dismay of his wife Susan (Moira Kelly), while their son Jake (AlexHouse) takes must settle for consolation on conversations with a 12-inch doll.   For her part Annette Jennings (Patricia Clarkson) is estranged from her husbandwhose skipped support payments make summer camp impossible for her androgynouskid, Sam (Kristen Stewart).  At the next house over, Helen Christianson (MaryKay Place) cannot see that her husband likes her just the way she is: vitaminsand meditation serve as her desperate drive to reverse the aging process, nor isshe above an attempted flirtation with a handyman.  There's nothing particularly new in the theme, but what gives the film its ownresonance is the successful blending of the characters, indicating that maybethere is consolation to be found in suburbia where the neighbors know oneanother by name and where these people will wise up to realize that things areno substitute for other human beings. While the families move toward closure bythe conclusion of these critical days, we suspect that they must ultimate dependfor relief, however insubstantial, on their bevy of toys.  ""The Safety ofObjects"" is saved by terminal grimness by Troche's sense of humor, particularlyin the role of Dermot Mulroney as the disappointed workaholic who at leasttemporarily becomes unhinged and shucks off his attachment to the workadayroutine. ","Safety Of Objects, The",R,2003,3.5
789,"      Welcome to the rat race - Russian style.  Filthy rich members ofthe Russian Mafia are dressed in black.  With their hookers at theirside, they are betting on rats running in tubes.  On the tables aresilver trays with stacks of U.S. hundred dollar bills, and as the loudmusic plays, people are sniffing dope.       ""Who are you?""  asks Emma of The Saint.  ""Nobody has a clue -least of all me,"" he replies.  You will probably feel that way aboutthis entire movie version of THE SAINT.  A hopeless muddle frombeginning to end.  The convoluted plot challenges even the mostattentive viewers.  Someone has stolen and then hidden all of theheating oil in Moscow, leaving Muscovites freezing to death.  Withwarring factions inside the Russian government, the country stands onthe brink of the second Russian revolution.  Thieves, selling pricelessart, hang out in the sewers.  And the piece de resistance, the secretto cold fusion is discovered and then stolen.  I could not keep trackof the details even with my trusty notepad at my side.  That everyonewore black and shot at each other did not help me keep the charactersstraight.       The show starts with the young kid known as Simon Templar (TheSaint) at an orphanage.  He is mistreated so he goes on to lead a lifeof crime.  His recurring nightmares of the cruelty of the priests therewill affect his behavior forever.  Unlike the other characterizationsof The Saint, Val Kilmer's rendition is much more heartless andmean-spirited, that is, until he meets Emma Russell.  Emma, played byElisabeth Shue, has just discovered how to make cold fusion work.  Oncehe falls in love with Emma, he is a changed man.       The show is so preposterous that I was stunned.  As a critic, I donot get shocked easily, but I was aghast at how awful the story was.Thirty minutes into the show, I looked over at my wife, and we bothstared at each other with our mouths open.  The script by JonathanHensleigh and Wesley Strick and the direction by Phillip Noyce leavesthe audience dazed and confused.  The show has no characters worthy ofour love or hate.  A totally preposterous picture that has so manylogical inconsistencies you will lose track if you try to count them.Let me just mention my personal favorite.  Randomly, people speak inRussian with English subtitles, but most of the time the Russiansconverse in English.  The inconsistency makes no sense.       As hopeless as the story is, the acting is much worse.  Sometimesthere are a few bright spots in movies to help pass the time.  Thisshow has none.  The people around me begin to laugh out loud at theacting as it was so pathetically bad.  Although the support cast is asalmost as weak as the two stars, let me just stick to commenting onKilmer and Shue.       Kilmer's inconsistency as an actor is well known.  His most recentdisgusting performance was in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, but he can beexcellent as he was in TOMBSTONE.  Some critics use phrases that Inever do because I feel they are more expletives than criticalcommentary.  The word ""self-indulgent"" is one such epithet.  I do notbelieve I have ever used that phrase to describe an actor's work untilthis review.  In THE SAINT, Kilmer gives a performance that sets thegold standard for self-indulgent acting.  He delights in his disguisesfrom the gay guy who offers to share his lipstick to the dottyprofessor with the bad teeth and the overbite.  In all of these hebecomes so infatuated with himself that he insults his audience withhis overacting.  Never does he take the time to develop his character.       Shue gave a marvelous, Academy Award nominated performance inLEAVING LAS VEGAS.  She played the hooker with tough realism.  Not fora minute did you doubt her performance.  In THE SAINT, she gives us ascientist who makes one of the most important discoveries of thetwentieth century but who acts like a ditzy teenager.  She give us nota single believable minute in the film.       THE SAINT, in many ways, resembles another recent remake, the filmMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.  Although I was only able to a mild thumbs up toMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, it is a cinematic masterpiece in comparison to THESAINT.       I did learn one thing from THE SAINT.  If I ever begin to die ofhypothermia, I want Elizabeth Shue nearby.  The way she saved Kilmermade it look almost worth jumping in the frozen river.       THE SAINT runs 1:57, but it will feel like an eternity.  The filmis rated PG-13 for violence, profanity, sexual situations and drugusage.  I was surprised it did not get an R rating.  The film would befine for teenagers, but I do not think it is suitable for younger kids.Actually, there is no reason for anybody of any age to waste their timewith THE SAINT.  I give it a whole star for reasons which escape me.","Saint, The",PG-13,1997,1.5
790,"In the opening scene of this dark crime thriller, Danny Parker (ValKilmer) is sitting alone, playing the trumpet, in a room ablaze with fire. In a""Don't give up on me yet"" voice-over plea, he begins a confessional, explainingwho he is - and isn't - and how his wife (Chandra West) was brutally shot bymasked killers simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and how hewas unable to protect her. The crime took place at the Salton Sea in SouthernCalifornia's steamy Imperial Valley. Obsessed by guilt and vengeance, Dannybecomes a ""tweaker,"" plunging into a seedy netherworld of addicts hooked oncrystal methamphetamine. While he makes money as a police informant, feedinginformation to undercover narcotics agents (Anthony La Paglia, Doug Hutchinson),he's also working as a middle-man in a lucrative drug deal. Written by TonyGayton, the plot twists and turns and, suffice it to say, nothing is what itseems - but that still doesn't make these scummy, repugnant - ultimately tragic- characters worth spending two hours with. For example, there's one lunaticwho's determined to heist Bob Hope's stool sample to sell on E-Bay and another,named Pooh-Bear (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has snorted so much meth that he nowhas a plastic nose. He graphically threatens Danny that his private parts couldbecome snack food for a hungry badger named Capt. Steubing. Val Kilmer hurlshimself into the film noir persona of the tattooed speed-freak, encouraged bynovice director D.J. Caruso, who seems bewitched by the euphoric intensity ofextreme degradation. But it's all a nasty, phony fraud, including Kilmer'strumpet playing which was dubbed by jazz hornman Terence Blanchard.

791,"Wanting badly to be another ethnic dance movie in the spirit of SATURDAYNIGHT FEVER, SAVE THE LAST DANCE never rises above SATURDAY NIGHT COLD. Starring two badly miscast leads, the film features Julia Stiles as would-beJulliard ballerina Sara Johnson and Sean Patrick Thomas as inner city blackhigh school student and would-be future doctor Derek Reynolds.  Stiles (10THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU) just does not have the body of a ballerina.  Wouldyou cast Danny DeVito to try out for the NBA?  And Thomas (CRUEL INTENTIONS)has upper middle-class prep school written all over him.  Don't get mewrong, the only good part of the movie is their relationship together.  Theproblem is that they don't fit the script, and even if they did, this is nota movie worth making.  Between its lame dance sequences is more dead airtime than a radio station during a long power blackout. The movie, directed by Thomas Carter and written by Duane Adler and CherylEdwards, never can decide what kind of movie it wants to be.  Sometimes it'sa sappy melodrama.  Sometimes it tries to be a hard hitting drama aboutjealousy among the races over interracial dating.   Derek's sister Chenille(Kerry Washington) complains to Sara about her taking ""one of the few decentmen we have left after jail, drugs and drive-bys.""  Sometimes it is aboutmale bonding (""Blood is thicker than blondes."")  And sometimes, finally, weget around to dancing, but the choreography is so awkward and the editing sochoppy that you probably won't care. It all starts when Sara's mom is killed while rushing to Sara's Julliardaudition.  Cue the harps.  Off Sara goes next to live with the man whom shecalls Roy (Terry Kinney) but who once was her father.  Cue the violins.  Hehas all of the personality of the torn wallpaper that decorates theflea-bitten apartment where he lives.  This makes Sara almost the only whiteface in her new high school. At this point, Sara refuses to dance anymore or even talk about it.  Ofcourse, after she meets and falls for Derek, it's quickly Julliard or bust. Along the way we are taught many dubious moral lessons.  Derek's sister,still in high school, has a son, but she shows more interest in her wardrobethan her son, whom she has palmed off on her mother like a batch of dirtylaundry.  Needless to say, the boy's father is even less interested in hisown offspring.  The kids all get fake ids and drink illegally in a fancynightclub in elegant clothes.  Where does all this money come from since noone seems to work? And then there's the issue of violence.   Malakai (Fredro Starr), with whomDerek unconvincingly claims to have once knocked over a liquor store, wantsto go shoot up another gang's neighborhood in retaliation for a previousraid.  Yes, this whole script is lifted from lots of other films and plays,most notably WEST SIDE STORY.  But in those, the actions have some amount ofcredibility.  Here people are shot, but the dreamy background music makes itseem downright romantic and not especially painful. I kept wanting to stop the movie, clear off the set except for the twoleads, and begin anew with a completely different script and director.  Ilike Stiles and Thomas together.  I did not like the movie in which theyfound themselves stuck. SAVE THE LAST DANCE runs 1:53.  It is rated PG-13 for violence, sexualcontent, language and brief drug references and would be acceptable forteenagers. My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the picture just **.  He thought it was tooslow, the whole Malakai character was unnecessary, and he didn't like Sara'srelationship with her parents.  He did comment favorably on the two leads.",Save the Last Dance,PG-13,2001,2
792,"""Saved!,"" a John Hughes-inspired teen comedy with a twist„it is setat a Catholic high school„successfully manages the tricky balancingact of being sharply satirical without making fun of its characters.Wh at one's personal religious beliefs are may, indeed, weigh uponwhat he or she takes away from the experience, but at its core itis a witty and sensitive motion picture that simply questions whetherhypocrisy plays a part in a black-and-white-taught religion when humannature clearly calls for a gray area. Life, after all, is not as simpleas that, and who, really, is to say what is right and natural andwhat is wrong and immoral? On the verge of her senior year at American Eagle Christian High,by-the-book Mary (Jena Malone) becomes wildly conflicted when herboyfriend, Dean (Chad Faust), announces to her that he is gay. Ina desperate effort to change his ways, Mary goes against what shehas been taught to believe and sleeps with Dean. Soon, Dean has beenshipped off to a sort of rehab center after his parents discover gayporn under his bed and Mary is forced to fend for herself when sheturns up pregnant. Once a self-proclaimed ""groupie for Jesus,"" Mary'snewfound individu alism and questioning of Christianity's teachingsleads her to be shunned by popular, misguided best friend Hilary Faye(Mandy Moore). Seeking solace in two fellow radicals„the rebellious(and sole Jew in the school) Cassandra (Eva Amurri) and Hilary Faye'swheelchair-bound, atheist brother, Roland (Macaulay Culkin)„Mary andher new pals set out over the course of the school year to try andopen up the minds of their tight-vested classmates and pastor principal (Martin Donovan). ""Why would God make everyone different if He wanted us all to be thesame?"" Mary asks at one point. This is the central notion exploredin ""Saved!,"" a perceptive slice-of-life, directed by Brian Dannelly,that nonetheless has a devilish sense of humor. While Mary comes toterms with Dean's revelation and her own pregnancy, which will makeher a pariah in her community if most anyone finds out, the self-absorbedHilary Faye speaks endlessly of being ""filled with Christ's love""even though she h as so obviously missed the point. Meanwhile, Cassandrasubtly ridicules those around her as a way of signifying how easilyshe can see through their shiny, lost veneers; Roland looks from theoutside in, rolling his eyes at the two-facedness he sees from theother students, none more so than fraudulently caring sister HilaryFaye; Pastor Skip worries about the sin of starting a relationshipwith Mary's mother, Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker); and Patrick (PatrickFugit), just back from a Christian skateboarding tour, is mostly indifferentabout his beliefs as he develops a crush on Mary. Having never gone to a Christian high school, it can only be assumed,based on the research director Dannelly has noted he did, that thisportrayal of such is mostly accurate, if occasionally exaggeratedfor cinematic purposes. At an assembly at the start of the schoolyear, Pastor Skip uses skewed terms like ""get our Christ on,"" askshis student in rap fashion if they are ""down with G-O-D,"" an d invitesanyone to come forward and recommit to God after a summer where theymay have slid just a little. Students, such as Tia (Heather Matarazzo),speak enthusiastically about having visions of Jesus as a desperateeffort to join Hilary Faye's in-crowd. And Hilary Faye, despite claimingto be giving and understanding, drops Mary the second she disagreeswith what she says and looks down negatively on her handicapped brother,to boot. The fixedly observed characters who populate ""Saved!"" arenever made fun of by Dannelly for their beliefs and ideas, althoughthose viewers who do not share such strict religious beliefs may naturallyfind things to giggle and sneer at. Instead, Dannelly zeroes in onthe tricky idea that even those people who are faithful worshippers,like Pastor Skip and Hilary Faye, are flawed and confused, still strugglingto oblige their religion even as they haven't yet gotten a grip onwho they are as human beings. After all, there is a tricky double-standardto be explored when everyone grows up being taught to be strong, free-thinkingcitizens while never wavering from their said religion's guidelines,especially when such guidelines can be read any number of ways. Screenwriters Brian Dannelly and Michael Urban do an exceptional jobof dealing with their wide ensemble of characters wiithout one-dimensionalizingthem. Hilary Faye, for example, the closest thing to an outright villain,is not demonized, and it is impossible not to feel sympathy for herin the conclusion when a key unsavory action of her's is discoveredand she must somehow move forward with other people's perception ofher changed forever. What she learns in the process, though„that nobodyis perfect and life is more complicated than what she had been allowingherself to see„is an invaluable stepping stone that makes you actuallykind of admire her. As Hilary Faye, this is the very type of partthat Mandy Moore (2004's ""Chasing Liberty"") needed to prove that sheisn't just a singer-turned-wannabe-actress, but a genuinely talentedand eclectic thespian who can play a varying degree of roles. Mooreis as close to perfection in her alternately funny and poignant turnas she has ever been before; she steals the movie, and her cover versionof The Beach Boys' ""God Only Knows"" over the opening credits is incendiary.  Coming in a close second, Eva Amurri (2002's ""The Banger Sisters""),whose acidic line deliveries are a way of calling fault to others'beliefs without actually coming off as a mean person, is an utterdelight as rebel Cassandra, who falls for soul mate Roland becausethey understand each other like no one else does. Macaulay Culkin(2003's ""Party Monster""), as Roland, is drolly funny in his secondaccomplished attempt to parlay into an adult actor, and the reliableJena Malone (2004's ""The United States of Leland"") narrowly avoidsthe typecasting she has become known for by being the"" troubled leadactor,"" rather than the ""troubled love interest."" ""Saved!,"" which bases most of its action around holidays and specialoccurrences during the school year (i.e. the first day of school,Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, the prom), is exceedingly clever„onescene featuring a botched exorcism is scored to the ""Tubular Bells""theme from ""The Exorcist""„but not too silly that its thought-provokingideas and character relationships get lost in the shuffle. Some subplotsare more undernourished than others, such as Patrick and Mary's romancebecause it is never made clear why he likes her so much, but the heartand passion that were used to make the film and deal with the themeson display is always there, an unfaltering constant.

No matter how many times the characters fall down -- Ithink the count runs into the hundreds -- it is never funny, not even once.When people aren't falling down, they do other ""original"" stuff like havingfood fights and making jokes about farts and masturbation.    The story concerns a guy, Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs), who is perpetuallyunlucky in love, and a woman, Judith (Amanda Peet), who has him under herthumb, hence the intended meaning of the movie's poster.  Biggs, of course,is the actor who was once lucky to have an infamous rendezvous with a pie,which catapulted him into undeserved fame.  Peet's claim to fame is her bodyand her sassy attitude.  Neither of the two leads are the least bit good inSAVING SILVERMAN.  This might be expected, but the awful performances bySteve Zahn and Jack Black, as Darren's buddies Wayne and J.D., are asurprise.  Both have previously been brilliantly on the comedic mark, Zahnin HAPPY, TEXAS and Black in HIGH FIDELITY. Judith calls Wayne and J.D. ""pigs,"" and truer words were never spoken.  Thescript, by Hank Nelken and Greg DePauls, revolves around Wayne and J.D.trying to get their buddy Darren back from Judith's clutches.  This schemeeventually involves kidnapping Judith, while trying to reinterest Darren inhis old flame, Sandy (Amanda Detmer). The movie, which is crude without ever being funny, features such gross-outgags as a butt implant scene.  There's also an attacking raccoon and a highschool football coach (R. Lee Ermey) who literally kills a referee formaking a bad call.  Stop me when you've finished laughing. To be fair, there are two mildly diverting parts to the picture.  AmandaPeet's slit-down-the-middle, revealing blouses do add an undeniable eyecandy factor to the film.  And Neil Diamond, whom the three guys worship,shows up for an extended cameo. As soon as Judith first lays her eyes on Darren's buddies, she burns rubberwith her car's tires, getting away from the guys as fast as she can.Watching the movie produces a similar desire. SAVING SILVERMAN runs 1:31.  It is rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor,language and thematic material and would be acceptable for teenagers. My son Jeffrey, almost 12, gave the movie * as well.  He complained that itwas utterly predictable and that he didn't laugh once.  He said thecharacters were all dumb and stupid but not the least bit funny. The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, February 9, 2001.In the Silicon Valley it will be showing at the AMC and the Centurytheaters.",Saving Silverman,PG-13,2001,1.5
794," There are films that just stand out, and if it isn't because it is wellwritten, then it is because an actor just takes over, and delivers what isundoubtedly one of the most deserving Oscar performances around.  Scent of a Woman, is a simple film, nothing complicated about it at all, andthe story is very easy to tell.  A college boy, Charles (Chris O'Donnell) ina private institution in the east ( Boston ) gets in trouble with a few ofhis friends, for which his future is at stake.  Since it  happens just priorto the Thanksgiving holidays, there isn't much that  the school can do todiscipline anyone until the following Monday.  In  the meantime, he getshimself a part time job to help take care of his financial needs for theholidays.  And that job is to take care of a retired, and blind, career armyman ( played by Al Pacino ).  And what looked like an easy job turns into aweekend in New York, where the real  story about the Colonel is unfolding.He wants to have one more fling,  and then end his life.  The Colonel is alone, his own family doesn't like him, or his surprisevisit, and he is not known for being Mr.. congeniality, either.  But Charlieis a well mannered kid, and his way eventually affects the aging Colonel.  Upon returning to the school on Monday, Charles is facing expulsion and aruined future because of his honesty, and integrity.  And in appears thesurrogate father who delivers the young man from the claws of defeat. Andthe school's discipline committee takes a harmless stand, so not to hurtanyone, which is the speech that delivers the young man from the claw of theover eager administrator with revenge on his mind.  A magnificent film, really nicely done, well executed in almost every phase,and it stimulates the feelings of the viewer, because we can not let go ofthe character or the story.  The aging Colonel still has an eye for women,and can smell them a mile away, and teases the younger Charlie about them.  There are many films that one should see on a large screen and this one isone of them, but unlike them, this one is stronger, even if seen at home, onthe video ( as I just did ), where one's emotional edges are allowed to runfreely.... and this film is at least one of those that  requires a pause...and then run back to it....  Great film in every respect. ",Scent of a Woman,R,1992,4
795,"Reminiscent of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" this a live-action comic-bookand - as such - it's filled with action-packed fun. Just as muscleman ArnoldSchwarzenegger conquered the screen as Conan, wrestler Dwayne Johnson (TheRock), after making his screen debut in ""The Mummy Returns,"" carves his nichewith this adventure. He plays Mathayus, a heroic warrior descended fromgenerations of Akkadian assassins skilled in the deadly arts, who rallies desertbarbarians to rebel against the onslaught of an evil, scheming warlord namedMemnon (Steve Brand). Memnon's secret weapon is a seer who advises him how andwhere to attack - and he's never lost a battle. So Mathays devises a plan tosneak into Memnon's palace in the fabled city of Gomorrah and slay thevisionary. But when he discovers it's the beautiful, scantily clad Cassandra(Kelly Hu), he takes her hostage, jumps on his trusty white camel and disappearsinto the Valley of the Dead to determine his own destiny. At his side are athief sidekick Arpid (Grant Heslov), for comic distraction, and the giant NubianBalthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan). Writer/co-producer Stephen Sommers, alongwith fellow writers William Osborne, David Hayter and Jonathan Hales, wasinspired by tales of a legendary Egyptian who ruled centuries before thebuilding of the Great Pyramid, and director Chuck Russell builds on their campy,cartoony approach. While coping with fire ants, cobras and human hostility, TheRock's bulging biceps match Schwarzenegger's ""Conan"" potential, along with hisstilted, monotone delivery of insipid lines of dialogue. On the Granger MovieGauge of 1 to 10, ""The Scorpion"" is a swashbuckling 7. What you see is what youget - and, if PG-13 sword-and-sorcery is what you're buying, you get yourmoney's worth. ","Scorpion King, The",PG-13,2002,1.5
796," ""Screwed"" sneaked into our local theaters without advancescreenings for critics - and screwed is how you'll feel if youinadvertently pay at the ticket counter. Stand-up comic Norm Macdonaldplays Willard Fillmore, a mild-mannered servant who works for nastyVirginia Crock, a wealthy Pittsburgh bakery owner played by ElaineStritch. Understandably bitter - since he has to scrub her denturesalong with her toilets and cars - and egged on by his best buddy, DaveChappelle, he decides to kidnap her beloved, yappy, mean-tempered lapdog for $1 million ransom and flee to the Caribbean. But, of course,their contrived, chaotic plan backfires.  None of this is funny -particularly Danny DeVito as a creepy, degenerate coroner. And NormMacdonald is amazingly inept; he cannot act - period.  Written byScott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski before ""Ed Wood,"" ""The Peoplevs. Larry Flynt,"" and ""Man on the Moon,"" it serves as theirdirectorial debut. Perhaps that's understandable since they alsocollaborated on the sloppy scripting of ""Problem Child."" On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Screwed"" is a wretched, idiotic1. Hard to believe, but it's worse than ""Battlefield Earth."" ",Screwed,PG-13,2000,0
797,"Just about everyone loves an underdog, especially movie-goers who ache to see their favorite team win in the final shotjust as the buzzer goes off.  ""Seabiscuit,"" then, has the makingsof a great crowd-pleaser not only because the title character(played by ten horses, each bearing a specialty) is a mostunexpected champion.  That's not all.  The story is by LauraHillenbrand which remains on the paperback best-seller listthough she expected to see maybe 5,000 copies from the backof her car.  There's more.  The jockey, played winningly byTobey Maguire, is too tall for the job, weighs too much, and hasbeen through a succession of Depression-inspired losses.  Mostof all, the tale takes place during the 1930's, a time that theentire country was going through economic hell with twenty-fivepercent of the labor force unemployed, the only hope for relief with Franklin D. Roosevelt a millionaire who unlike our currentchief executive sided with the underdog to provide massive helpthrough the National Recovery Act.     While the four-hundred page paperback goes intoconsiderable detail, much overlooked to squeeze emotion into afilm that runs an all-too-short 140 minutes, scripter-director GaryRoss knows how to balance the need for character expositionwith the requirements of cinematic drama.  The racetrackscenes are convincing, though we can easily tell that MrMaguire, shown during each race only in closeup (with thescenery moving perhaps?) while his stunt double is regularlycaught from the rear appears shorter than the star as the vastmajority of jockeys would be.  (For the role Maguire trimmeddown to 137 pounds from his previous 160, though at weigh-insthe scale regularly shows 115.  Now that's the kind of scale toown!)     ""Seabiscuit"" is as much about the two-legged characters asthe equine animals, a patient exposition springing to life whenthe  jockey Red Pollar (Maguire), owner Charles Howard (JeffBridges) and trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) finally gettogether to discuss their agenda for winning races.  Howard,who could not make a go with his bicycle sale-and-repair shop,sees the American Dream beginning in 1906 as the owner of alot selling new cars which would begin to replace horses as thefavored method of transportation.  Having ironically said that hewouldn't pay $5 for the best horse in town, he buys theimprobably small Seabiscuit who on his first round on thepractice track wiggles and wobbles like a two-months' old pupexploring the wonders of the outdoors for the first time.  RedPollard, a jockey whom Howard expects to remain in thatposition forever, comes out of hard-scrabble childhood, givenaway by his poverty-stricken Irish-immigrant parents to a manwho could exploit the young man's gift for riding.  When the soft-spoken horse-whisperer Tom Smith (often called SilentTom) manages to quiet the wild Seabiscuit down, the horse ison the road to becoming to a champion.     Narrated in a dry, Masterwork Theater manner by historianDavid McCulloch but given comic leeway by the race-trackannouncer Tick Tock McGlaughlin (William H. Macy whooutdoes Walter Winchell in a radio-crazed era), ""Seabiscuit""throws add extra soap-opera touches, particularly that jockeyPollard, unknown to his boss, is blind in one eye (the cause notbrought out in the film but the result of having had a stonekicked into his race during a race), is thrown by a spookedhorse and suffers a leg injury which appears to end his career. Seabiscuit himself becomes lame and is almost put down by thevet but goes on to wrap up with a grand victory.     The music score by Randy Newman is perfect: building up toa crescendo during the races but low-key and often sentimentalotherwise, while photographer John Schwartzman brings uscloser to the track than most of us in the audience will ever get. In a stunning film debut, real-life jockey Gary Stevens serves inthe role of George Woolf, who takes over for Pollard during thelatter's recovery from an accident while Elizabeth Banks is finein the underwritten role of Howard's second wife Marcela.    In the backstretch of this sequel-saturated summer season,what more can we ask for? ",Seabiscuit,PG-13,2003,3
798,"      When you read the title SEARCH AND DESTROY, you immediatelythought it was another vehicle for either Jean Claude Van Damme orCharles Bronson to show off their ability to slaughter hordes of badguys.  Right?  Wrong.  This is a musical starring Christopher Walken asa song and dance man.       Okay, so I lied, but only partially.  This movie does feature asong and dance routine by Christopher Walken, and although it is ablack comedy with a plot, the plot's meaning is so obscure thatcharacterizing the show as a musical for its single musical number, isas good a characterization as any.       In the movie, Martin Mirkhein (Griffin Dunne) is a small timeoperator and loser married to Lauren Mirkhein (Rosanna Arquette).  Helistens to the motivational pitches made on late night cable TV by Dr.Waxling (Dennis Hopper) and loves Dr. Waxling's adventure novelfeaturing a character called Martin Strong who reveals the four innersecrets of life.  His secrets include don't apologize since whatapologize for is what you really want.  Another is that just becauseyou do something that doesn't mean it's interesting.  Dr. Waxling'sspeaking into the camera is such a parody that it is clearly the bestpart of the movie.  Too bad the scene only lasts a minute or two.       Martin Mirkhein decides that the way to make some serious moneyand to get his $100,000+ overdue Florida taxes paid right away asadvised by his accountant (Martin Scorsese - also the executiveproducer) is to make a movie of Dr. Waxling's book.  Roger (EthanHawke), Dr. Waxling's bodyguard, will not let Mirkhein see Dr. Waxlingso Mirkhein makes a play for Marie Davenport (Illeana Douglas) thedoctor's assistant in order to get to see the doctor.  This is not easysince Mirkhein, like Martin Strong, practices sexual abstinence to showhis strength of character.  Later Mirkhein seeks the aid of some shadycharacters called Kim Ulander (Christopher Walken) and Ron (JohnTurturro) to make money to impress the doctor.       First time director David Salle seems to think he is going to bethe next Fellini.  Salle populates his movie with tons of quirkycharacters like Fellini.  Salle's, however, are about as believable andinteresting as cardboard figures.  The audience in the art house I wentto set through the entire movie in stunned silence.  Nobody moved.  Weall stared at the screen in amazement.  What was this all about weseemed to all be thinking.  When the credits started, everyone, exceptme, quickly stood up and left immediately (and without saying a word).       The script by Michael Almereyda, based on a play by Howard Korder,has the sole virtue of being extremely bizarre.  The writing and thedirecting had all of the actors acting like free agents from differentmovies who all happened to be captured by the camera together.  Therewas no chemistry or believability among them.  I must admit, on theother hand, I never considered leaving early.  I developed sort of amorbid fascination of where the show was going and how it would end.By the way, it goes nowhere and the ending is the worst part -gratuitous violence.       I am a fan of every one of the actors mentioned above.  I evenlike Dunne and Arquette who have been in one bad movie after another.I felt sad seeing all the actors in this show.  I kept thinking of allof the times I had enjoyed their work.  I absolutely loved Ethan Hawke,for example, in the recent BEFORE SUNRISE - which is a show you mustsee if you have not done so already, but here he was given a worthlesspart with pathetic dialog.  What a waste! ",Search and Destroy,R,1995,1
799," [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written yearsago when I was just getting started. I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many detailsare missing that I would normally include today.]  So are you searching for a good movie for the whole family?  Doesyour household have preteens in it who have outgrown the little kidmovies, but still would like to see shows that are exciting and thatcan inspire them?  Do you like shows that not just for preteens, butthe whole family can enjoy?       Let me take a little different approach in this review.  Think ofit as a questionnaire.  Do you like movies where  - the characters are intelligent - the script is bright - people don't have to talk in 4 letter words to make points - kids to be heroes do not have to be in sports - it is okay to show kids from non-broken homes - it is okay to show kids who are healthy, not reformed - it does not have to have stupid sub-plots - parents can be wholesome yet still be interesting - you can show an adult at their place of work and show them happy - you can have classic showdown scenes yet have real surprises - you can have no violence and not be boring  If you were able to answer in the affirmative to most of thesequestions, I recommend SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and give it ***.Even if you know nothing about the game of chess, I still recommend itto you.  Knowing chess will improve your enjoyment only slightly of thefilm and is not necessary.       With a strong cast including Max Pomeranc as chess whiz JoshWaitzkin, Joe Mantegna as his wise but not too pushy dad Fred, JoanAllen as his mom Bonnie, Ben Kingsley as the expert Bruce Pandolfini,and a great Laurence Fishburne as the local park chess king Vinnie.  Asweet and heartwarming show. ",Searching for Bobby Fischer,PG,1993,3
800,"      SECOND BEST is about a 42-year old Welsh man (William Hurt) whohas never been married and has hardly ever even had a girlfriend.  Hedecides to adopt a boy, but being a single man, he is told that he willonly be offered older boys who are mentally disturbed.       A 10 year old boy (Christopher Miles) comes to live with him inhis tiny Welsh village where he is the postmaster and local grocer.  Aspromised, this boy is troubled.  He comes from a LORD OF THE FLIES sortof past, and his Dad (Keith Allen), whom he loves dearly, has been inprison for a long time.  He and his Dad made a pact, before his Dadleft to go to prison, to love each other more than anyone else forever.       The show happens as much in the past as in the present and tellsnot only the boy's past but Hurt's as well.  The interest in the showis provided by Hurt's character more than the boy's although the scriptwas written, I think, to have the movie center around the boy.       Hurt plays a repressed man who looks at the world as if he isscared to venture into it.  The scenes where the boys trashes his houseand he just stares without speaking were a bit much even for hiswithdrawn character.  I did not buy these scenes.  On the whole though,Hurt plays it very convincingly, and you feel really sorry for him.       The main problem in the show for me was the casting of the boy.He was supposed to be an enigma, but he carried it overboard.  Duringmost of the movie it was hard to understand anything at all about whatthe boy was feeling and hence hard to empathize with him.  The director(Chris Menges) should have realized this and given him better guidance.       All of the minor characters were quite good except the role playedby John Hurt (no relation to William) which seemed to be out of anothermovie.  My favorite minor character was Jane Horrocks's portrayal ofthe social worker.  She was the only funny character in the movie andevery one of her lines was a riot.  I wish her part had been madelarger.  Given that everyone loved her in LIFE IS SWEET whereas I hatedher in it, I was surprised myself at how enchanted I was with heracting in SECOND BEST.       Just watching the movie may make you want to move to the serenityof Wales - lovely cinematography (Ashley Rowe).  On the other hand, itmay scare you away from ever adopting a troubled child.  A lot of themovie was either sad or disturbing because of the subject matter. ",Second Best,PG-13,1994,2.5
801,"Some benighted people have contempt for cab drivers who can'tspeak English.  Almost everyone mistrusts lawyers and used carsalespersons.  But of all the people who work for a living, the onesconsidered the squarest, the least hip, the most wrapped up intheir fields to the exclusion of the arts, dentists are right up therewith accountants and actuaries.  Mention the word dentist andwatch a smile (ironically) come to the face of people who think ofthese tooth mavens as too straight-laced to be believable.  Dothey have a life outside the office?  Do the men have wives orgirlfriends and the women have men to come home to?  Do theyplay tennis and watch the Super Bowl?  Probably not, but in themovies anything is possible.     Or so say Craig Lucas, the successful writer of imaginativeplays such as ""Prelude to Kiss"" (which played well years back atNew York's defunct Circle Rep Theatre), and Alan Rudolph, thesixty-year old director of such offbeat films as ""Trouble in Mind"" (astylized melodrama set in the near future about an ex-cop freshout of jail who ties up with some young innocents) and ""MortalThoughts"" (about the questioning of a woman who may be involvedin a murder).     While  Rudolph and Lucas are too committed to whimsy tomimic Ingmar Bergman, in adapting Jane Smiley's novella ""Daysof Grief"" to the screen they portray a disintegrating marriage byshowing people undergoing the stresses that real people may findthemselves suffering.  What's more they avoid the hackneyedhistrionics of soap opera while dishing out a good deal of comicfervor.  In the more interesting initial half, Rudolph finds Dr. DaveHurst (Campbell Scott) working in the same dental office as hiswife Dana (Hope Davis), also a dentist a physical closeness atwork which is itself a recipe for trouble.  After their busy days inthe office, they go home to three young daughters, the youngestgoing through the terrible two's and into slapping her dad when heholds her and resisting the open arms of her mother.  Their otherdaughters, now of school age, are well behaved but add to familytensions by flu-like illnesses which their pediatrician believes arethe result of the kids' ""picking up the anxieties"" of their parents. In a key scene, David spots his wife, who is engaged in anamateur opera presentation of ""Nabucco,"" in what looks like theembrace of another man.  When she comes home late now andthen, he suspects infidelity but keeps his fears to himself lest aconfrontation lead her to end their union.     While the story itself is nothing new, Rudolph's treatment isimaginative.  Sitting in as Dave's alter ego, Slater (Denis Leary), inthe role of a patient who would be angry and vindictive even if thefilling he receives from Dr. Hurst did not fall out, pops up from timeto time in Dave's hallucinations.  He's in the Hursts' home, he'soutdoors in the country.  He comments like a Greek chorus onthe impossibility of marriage and in a climactic point urges Daveto kill with wife by bopping her with a poker.  When Daveunconsciously mutters ""I could kill you"" within his wife's hearing,their marriage comes to a head.     There are times that you might want Dave to go off the wall likeSteve Martin's character in Frank Oz's ""Little Shop of Horrors"" orthe same comic in David Atkins's ""Novocaine,"" the successfuldentist who's about to marry his hygienist but is attracted to afemale patient who leads him down a dark path.  Yet thesubtleties are a treasure.  We sometimes wonder whethergrounds exist at all for the deterioration of their marriage given theway Dave takes care of the three girls whether through theirvomiting or, in better times, by cutting up their food while Danaseems unattached to home life. The real problem is that like thestereotypical dentist, Dave's lack of charisma and Dana's distantlook make are the existential root of their dilemma rather thananything they actually do.       Campbell Scott does not have the role of his life as he did inDylan Kidd's ""Roger Dodger"" but the always reliable performerwould be welcome in anything he does while Hope Davis, sodetermined and strong in Alexander Payne's ""About Schmidt"" isso aloof that we don't wonder that the only reason Dave wants tokeep the marriage together is to avoid the hassle of a divorce andcustody battles.  Denis Leary is his signature self, the comiccenter of the drama with huge pompadour and provocativedemeanor, a perfect Mr. Hyde to Campbell Scott's Jekyll.  ""SecretLives"" is nothing if not toothsome. ","Secret Lives Of Dentists, The",R,2003,3
802,"      Highly acclaimed writer and director Mike Leigh's (LIFE IS SWEETand NAKED) latest film is SECRETS & LIES.  The picture won the Palmed'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and the lead actress, BrendaBlethyn, got the best actress award for her work in the film.  Thepicture is an incredible character study, that goes from morose to lifeaffirming.  It is a complex picture that is both tragic and comedic.Most of all, it is a highly involving and rewarding film for theaudience.       In the press kit, Leigh describes it thus, ""SECRETS & LIES isabout roots and identity, the ever changing images we all have ofourselves and each other, and our compulsive need to reaffirmconstantly who and what we are, and where we come from.  It is also atale of love and caring and deep longings, and of the awesomerelentlessness of the passage of time.""       As the show started, I was not sure if I was going to like it ornot.  The lead actress, Brenda Blethyn (from A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT)as middle-aged Cynthia, seemed about to give one of those performanceslike Crissy Rock's in LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD where the character is sounlikable that watching the show becomes a challenge.  For the record,I loved Crissy Rock and LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD even if it is hard tostomach.  In SECRETS & LIES, this did not turn out to be the case, andthe audience develops both an empathy and a love for Cynthia.       Cynthia's brother Maurice (Timothy Spall from LIFE IS SWEET) is aprosperous photographer.  Although his specialty is weddings, he willphotograph anyone.  Like a Woody Allen film, there is an hilarioussequence where we have short clips of different people having theirpictures made.  The subjects range from a little boy who keeps pickinghis nose to a middle aged woman who laughs at herself dressed inclothes for her boudoir.  It had all of the critics at the screening institches.       Maurice's wife Monica (Phyllis Logan) stays at home spending hismoney on their pristine house (sets by Alison Chitty).  She explainsthe details down to the choice of the color peach for the bath since ithas an aura of tranquillity.  When showing off the house she scurriesaround closing toilet lids as she shows off each of the bathrooms.  Itis the classic house made not to be lived in.       Cynthia is an unhappy, depressed, and unattractive factory workerwho lives with her grown daughter Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), who is astreet cleaner and seems to be nothing more than a younger clone of hermom.  Cynthia looks at her swollen legs and remarks that they are aspretty as a teenager's.  She doesn't believe it, but it stops her fromcrying.  When she talks, she squeaks, but she spends most of the firstpart of the film crying.  For a while, I didn't think she would everstop crying.       Soon the show cuts to a black optometrist named Hortense (MarianneJean-Baptiste).  More on the character's name at the end of the review.Hortense is an orphan, and now that her adopted parents have died, shewants to find her birthmother.  Since the late 70s, the law in Englandsays she can read all of her old birth records.  She does and findsthat her mother is the white Cynthia.       Hortense had a happy childhood, and she is a successful, collegeeducated professional.  The difference in the color of their skins is ametaphor for all of their many differences.  Hortense has theself-confidence that her birth mother lacks.  Parts of the motherreminded me of Ratzo Rizzo from MIDNIGHT COWBOY.       When Hortense telephones her mother, her mother tells her to nevercall again.  Given their apparent incompatibility, the audience almostwants to cry out, forget it already.  The rest of the show is aboutthem getting to know and like each other and coming to terms with theirdifferences.       The script is intelligent and never predictable.  It tacklessensitive issues, and although the director lets the actors hang outtheir souls for all to see, it is never exploitive and alwayssensitive.  It is also so funny that it would be possible to view theshow totally as a comedy and ignore the messages, but that would be apity.  The sad cello music (Andrew Dickson) serves notice that thepicture is to be taken seriously not matter how big the laughs.  Theone criticism I have is that some of the scenes go on too long, and thefilm would have been better had editor Jon Gregory been more vigorousin his approach.       The show is aptly named.  When Cynthia sees that Hortense isblack, she seriously believes that Hortense can not be the daughter shegave up at birth.  The script makes this and all of the other secretsand lies in the story quite plausible.       The show can be enjoyed for the big story or the small ones.  Whena once gorgeous crash victim comes in to get her photo made for hersolicitor, a touched Maurice tells her, ""Life isn't fair then is it.Somebody always draws the short straw.""  Maurice is a sensitive guywith a beer belly and his own secrets and demons.  At one point in theshow, he excuses one of the character's actions with, ""She can't helpit; she never had enough love.""  After telling another of the familysecrets, he confides, ""Secrets and lies.  We're all in pain.""       The show is a grand collection of complex characters, and allbecome sympathetic by the end.  Each has a story that will touch oramuse you or both.       SECRETS & LIES is a bittersweet comedy and tragedy that is wrappedup effectively.  When it is over, you realize you have seen someincredible performances and a magnificent directorial job.  I hope tosee Brenda Blethyn's name when the Oscar nominations come out.       I do have to note that if I was a girl, my mother seriouslyintended to name me Hortense after her favorite doll from childhood.Personally, I can not imagine a more horrible name, apologies to all ofHortense's out there in the world, and I thank my lucky stars that Iwas born male with name I like rather than female with a name likeHortense.  The excellent actress playing Hortense at least made me feela little bit better about my close call with that hideous name.       SECRETS & LIES runs a little too long at 2:22.  At the time of thepress screening, it had not yet been rated by the MPAA, but the littlebad language in the show has a few F words so it will probably get anR.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence, but it is a very intenseshow.  It would be fine for any teenager, but not younger.  I give thefilm a strong recommendation and award it *** 1/2. ",Secrets & Lies,NR,1996,3
803," In John Whitesell's SEE SPOT RUN, Agent 11 is placed in the agent relocation program after a Mafia boss, Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), puts out a contract on him.  Sonny sends his top two goons, Gino (Joe Viterelli) and Arliss (Steven Schirripa), to take out the agent, who bit off one of Sonny's testicles.  Did I mention yet that Agent 11 is a dog?  And not just any mutt, but ""the most decorated canine in FBI history.""  The hit men, not surprisingly, are upset about having to ""whack a pooch.""  If this sounds like a silly kids' comedy, it is.  Repeatedly falling in the same pile of dog poop got the most laughs at our screening.  In second place was a flaming Zebra fart.  Don't ask.  The movie stars David Arquette as Gordon, a mailman who has a love/hate relationship with dogs.  One day, the anal-retentive girl next-door, whom he's been trying unsuccessfully to date, is forced to entrust him with her 6-year-old son, James (Angus T. Jones), when her babysitter gets sick just before an out-of-town business trip.  Jones (SIMPATICO) is an adorable kid with a sad pumpkin-sized face.  Through a series of misadventures, Agent 11 comes to live with Gordon and James, and they name him Spot.  (The dog is spotless, and the dog's new name is chosen basically so that the movie can have a catchy title.)  Michael Clarke Duncan (the big convict in THE GREEN MILE) plays FBI Agent Murdoch, Agent 11's partner.  Perpetual slob Gordon transforms James from his excessively healthy diet of bran cereal, soy milk and prunes to a heavily sugar-laden one of non-stop junk food.  The result is like giving an alcoholic a gallon of vodka.  The kid goes crazy.  To reinforce this drinking analogy, Gordon wakes James the morning after he falls asleep with a big bottle of soda on the sofa.  Giving James a chocolate donut, Gordon tells him to have a bit of ""the dog that bit you.""  SEE SPOT RUN runs 1:34.  It is rated PG for crude humor, language and comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages.  My son Jeffrey, almost 12, gave the picture ***.  He said that he liked the dog and the plot.  He commented that he particularly liked the way that they built the characters.   ",See Spot Run,PG,2001,2
804,"      SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is the latest Jane Austin movie to come tothe big screen.  Taking her first crack with a movie script, EmmaThompson adapted the novel for the cinema.  For the director, we havethe wonderful and imaginative Ang Lee from EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN amongother highly acclaimed movies.  To compliment these, almost all of theroles are well cast.  The result for me was an excellent movie, butone, nevertheless, that disappointed me and found me checking my watchduring the slow parts.  Perhaps my disappointment lay in havingrecently seen similar but much better film adaptations in PERSUASION byJane Austin and FEAST OF JULY by H. E. Bates.       SENSE AND SENSIBILITY tells the story of two families joined by acommon father, Henry Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson).  At the start of thestory, the father dies and by law and by custom he passes his hugeestate onto his eldest son, John (James Fleet), but admonishes him totake care of his sister, Mrs. Dashwood (Gemma Jones).  John's evil wifeFanny (Harriet Walter) soon convinces him that the Dashwoods, having noestate to take care of, can get along fine on the 500 pounds per annumfrom the will and need no help from them.       Mrs. Dashwood's family consists of two daughters of marrying age,Elinor (Emma Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet) and one about nine(Emile Francois).  The Dashwoods stay briefly at the family estatewhile Fanny counts the silver.  During this interlude, Fanny's youngerbrother, Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), stops by for a visit.  He is amodest man of minimal emotions.  He proclaims that, ""All I want, allI've ever wanted is the quiet of a private life, but my mother wants medistinguished.""       Eventually, Edward falls in love with Elinor, but Marianne is notimpressed, declaring, ""Can love really be satisfied with such politeaffections?  To love is to burn.""  Fanny can not stand the idea of herbrother falling in love with poor relatives and gets the Dashwoods outof her house and Edward off to London.  The Dashwoods rent a mere""cottage"" owned by their cousin, a boisterous, rich, but fairly crudegentleman (Robert Hardy).       At the cottage, they met two mysterious men, the war hero ColonelBrandon (Alan Rickman) and the handsome young John Willoughby (GregWise), who both fall instantly in love with Marianne.  They are jealousof each other, and John claims that ""Brandon is the sort of maneveryone speaks well of, but nobody talks to.""  To further complicatematters, Lucy Steele (Imogen Stubbs) drops by to confess her love forEdward.  A soap opera of the highest caliber.       Many wonderful scenes abound.  The best is a sad scene of Mariannein blowing cold and gray rain while dramatic music plays.  Many smallscenes were wonderful too.  One of my favorites was the one whereMarianne and John Willoughby challenge each other in a sort of loveduet to recite Shakespeare's sonnets by heart.       The best piece of acting is by Kate Winslet from HEAVENLYCREATURES.  She is a stunning actress who shows more emotion thateveryone else in the movie combined.  I hope to see her in many morefilms.  The brilliant Emma Thompson gives a perfectly acceptableperformance, but one of the least impressive of her career.  Hugh Grantplays Hugh Grant and sticks to a single awkward expression.       Emile Francois and Gemma Jones have small parts but do a lot withthem.  Imogen Stubbs, best in the great, but largely unknown movie ASUMMER STORY, gives a fetching performance.  Alan Rickman and Greg Wiseplay excellent mysterious roles.  Only James Fleet and Harriet Walterseem miscast.  As villains, they are never believable and play theirroles as too much of a caricature.       The best part of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY may be the costumes (JennyBeavan and John Bright), especially the men's hats with the largeflowing brims.  Made me want to run out to my local haberdasher - toobad hats are no longer in high fashion.  The sets by Luciana Arrighiare highly evocative of that era.  The music by Patrick Doyle has thedrama of some of the melodramas of the 30s and 40s.  The cinematographyby Michael Coulter does a good job of bringing out the inherit beautyof the surroundings.       Now for the problems with SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  For some reason,Ang Lee decides to hold back too much.  The emotional punch ofPERSUASION rarely occurs here; there just is not enough tension andpassion.  Lee keeps throttling his actor and actresses.  Given the highenergy of his other pictures, I remain nonplused why he approached thismovie the way he did.  The slow editing by Tim Squyres must also sharesome of the blame.  In an otherwise enjoyable show, I found myselfgetting bored at times.  Admittedly SENSE AND SENSIBILITY has awonderful ending and people do leave the theater with an upbeat feelingeven with all of its flaws.       SENSE AND SENSIBILITY runs a long 2:15; my seat was complainingwell before the end.  It is rated PG, but is totally non-offensive Gfare.  I think it would interest kids over about eight.  Even though Iwas quite disappointed by the film, I did like it a lot and recommendit to you.  It gets *** in my book. ",Sense and Sensibility,PG,1995,3
805," Life goes on as a delightful romantic comedy, SERENDIPITY, comes to ourtheaters.  Set in the Big Apple, it proves that terrorists can blow upbuildings, but they can't take away the world's love affair with New York.  Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) is a fate fanatic, and Jonathan Trager (JohnCusack) is just an old fashion romantic.  While Christmas shopping, these twostrangers meet over a pair of gloves in Bloomingdales.  He wants the last pairof black gloves for his girlfriend, but Sara wants them for her boyfriend. Their amicable disagreement turns into an enchanted few hours together. Although he wants them to exchange names and phone numbers before they separate,she insists that they leave it to fate.  His name and number go on a five-dollarbill, and hers on a book (""Love in the Time of Cholera"").  Both items are thenput into circulation.  If it is their destiny to be together, then they willfind the items someday.  Someday.  This message-in-a-bottle story by Marc Klein has certain inevitable events, buthow and when they occur are the movie's sweet surprises.  Director Peter Chelsomhas just the right touch with the material.  His masterful staging of thepredictable ending gives it a graceful subtlety as well as a magical moment. (Psst.  If you promise not to tell, I'll reveal the identity of Peter Chelsom'slast film.  It was the disastrous TOWN & COUNTRY.  I know.  It's hard to believethat it could be the same person.)  Cusack (HIGH FIDELITY) turns in another of his flawless performances, andBeckinsale redeems herself after starring in PEARL HARBOR.  The two of them havegreat chemistry, which is hard to do since they have relatively few scenestogether.  Most of the movie happens a few years after the glove incident, whenthey have (almost) given up looking for each other.  Now about to be married --he to Halley (Bridget Moynahan), and she to Lars (John Corbett) -- they are(almost) completely happy.  Among the excellent supporting cast, Jeremy Piven, as an obituary writer, playsJonathan's best friend, and Molly Shannon, as a non-believing New Age bookstoreowner, plays Sara's best friend.  But the scene stealer is Eugene Levy (BEST INSHOW and the AMERICAN PIE series), who plays a hilarious clothing salesman.  Your audience will undoubtedly ""ooh"" and ""aah"" a lot as Jonathan and Sara keepalmost connecting.  And as you leave the theater, you'll probably let out onelong ""aah,"" as you float away in bliss.  SERENDIPITY runs just 1:25.  It is rated PG-13 for ""a scene of sexuality, andfor brief language"" and would be acceptable for kids about 9 and up.  My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ** 1/2.  He thought the film was funny but saidthat he liked Cusack a lot better in films like GROSS POINTE BLANK. ",Serendipity,PG-13,2001,3
806,"They say that travel broadens the mind, but sometimes youwonder.  If you go on those if-it's-Tuesday-this-must-be-Belgium tours, the only thing you'll broaden is your waistline. Perhaps we should distinguish between travel and tourism. The tourist visits places for status, for a pleasant change ofscenery, and for picking up souvenirs, rugs, and clothing thathe could get more cheaply at home. The traveler's motives,by contrast, would include a genuine interest in a culture otherthan his own and perhaps even the hope of a revelation thatwill change his life.  When Heinrich Harrer trained and trekkedfrom his native Austria to the remote Himalayas in 1939, hisaim was to conquer the famed Nanga Parbat peak.  Hismotive was only partly the physical joy of the expedition.  Asa self-absorbed Austrian who happened to be a member ofthe Nazi party, he had a nationalistic agenda: he wanted tosucceed where others failed.  Little did he know that he wouldwind up in the capital of Tibet, one of the few foreigners everallowed to visit the palace of the holy leader, the Dalai Lama. More important, his visit would change the man radically froma narcissist who ran out on his very pregnant wife because hehad no interest in being saddled with a child, to a humblehuman being who would return to his home and make hispeace with wife and son.   Harrer wrote his memoirs about the seven years he spentin Tibet.  The movie is a biographical drama loosely based onhis story.  Filming principally in the Argentine Andes whichstand in for the glorious Himalayan peaks, director Jean-Jacques Annaud--who was at the helm for such films as""Quest for Fire,"" ""The Name of the Rose"" and ""The Lover""--traces Harrer's journey in painstaking detail.  Annaud is betterat capturing Harrer's conflicts with nature and tussles with hisenemies than he is at seizing the inner struggle whichconverts this hedonist into a mensch, but ""Seven Years InTibet"" is captivating material that should delight lovers ofadventure stories and National Geographic-style travelogues,devotees of psychological drama, and of course, fans ofHollywood's #1 matinee idol, Brad Pitt.   The story opens in Austria just after its Anschluss withGermany as Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) boards a train,arguing with his pregnant wife (Ingeborga Dapkunaite), whoopposes the four-month Himalayan trek he is about to make.  Led by mountain climbing guide Peter Aufschnaiter (DavidThewlis), his group seeks to scale Nanga Parbat, where awounded Harrer saves the life of his guide.  The group arearrested and made prisoners of war by British troops in India,as World War II had broken out.  After several failed attemptsto escape Harrer--who repeatedly insists on ""going it alone""--makes good his breakout in Aufschnaiter's group where thetwo traverse the Indian border to the kingdom of Tibet.   Through cinematographer Robert Fraisse's lens, theTibetan capital of Lhasa is made to look like Shangri-La. Though suspicious of ""foreign devils,"" the peacelovinginhabitants accept Harrer, who becomes a teacher to thereligious leader, the Dalai Lama (played at age 14 byJamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk, a Bhutanese).  His Holinessand Harrer become fast friends.  The Austrian teaches himabout the West and is in turn enchanted by the rituals of thisEastern society.  Becky Johnston's screenplay takes everyopportunity to cram in details of this exotic culture, describingthe protocol for meeting the Dalai Lama; the regard thepeople have even for the lowly worm which, they say, couldhave been someone's mother in another life; the fierce desirefor independence which leads this peaceloving people to takeup arms against Chinese invaders.  In fact the film seems soeager to educate its audience about the charm of the peopleand the beauty of the landscape that Pitt's inner journey oftenfades from our notice.     Movies are, after all, a visual form which can do a lot betterdazzling us with flashy settings, some brief but tautly editedbattle scenes, and colorful costumes, than with illustrating thejourney within.  Perhaps we should not blame director Annaudfrom highlighting external points.  But the emphasis does notdo justice to its central figure who--we must be convinced--isundergoing a profound metamorphosis into a caring andhumble fellow.  That said, Annaud does coax excellentperformances especially from Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchukas the nervy and terminally curious Dalai Lama, from DavidThewlis as the companionable and often humorous PeterAufschnaiter, and from dozens of Buddhist monks who weretransported to Argentina for the filming. Fans of Brad Pitt willenjoy seeing him looking every bit the Aryan with shimmeringblond hair, and by contrast as the disheveled traveler, sohungry that he rushes to steal some food from two spoiledLhasa Apsos. The $70 million budget shows, as technicaleffects are A-1.     Some scholars have expressed disappointment that Harreris treated as a hero since he was a member of the Nazi party,but the movie, doubtless reproducing the wishes of the man inhis own biography, downplays this component.  When Harreris given a Nazi flag while boarding his train for India, hesimply grabs it indifferently and tucks it into the bottom of hisbackpack.  When he is arrested, he tells the British captorsthat he has nothing to do with the war; he is just a climber. When told that Germany has surrendered, Harrer seemspleased as this means he can return to his home.  During thefinal credits we are given the poignant reminder that onemillion Tibetans died at the hands of the Chinese conquerors,who destroyed 6,000 monasteries as well. ",Seven Years in Tibet,PG-13,1997,2.5
807,"On the internet's principal movie site, imdb.com, I noted thiscomment: ""'Sex and Lucia' is not about sex."" Hmmm.  I wonderwhat version he saw, because ""Lucia y el sexo"" competes with""Y tu mama tambien"" for the most erotic art-pic of recentmonths right up there in the tradition of Catherine Breillat'sironically named ""Romance,"" which is about a woman rejectedby her lover who goes on a sexual odyssey.  But while""Romance"" is not really erotic and at times dull, ""Sex and Lucia""glows with Basque director Julio Medem's ambience: hisimages are as important as the story, many quite beautiful.     ""Sex and Lucia"" is not about sex as mere recreation but as theconsummation of a frightfully alive passion that burns with suchintensity that we can believe its central character, Lucia, who inthe midst of orgasm says ""I'm dying, I'm dying.""  (That doesn'tcome off the way it sounds on the printed page, which is all themore reason that this is a must-see film.)  The San Sebastian-born Medem's new film is in turn with  well received ""Lovers ofthe Arctic Circle"" deals with people who meet at the age of eightand know that they are destined to be together.  Since thelovers in that 1998 work are palindromically named Anna andOtto, we understand that Medem means to tell us that love iscircular.  ""Sex and Lucia"" pretty much tosses out any intent atstraight narrative, shifting not only by way of flashbacks but witha circle of temporal-eschewing scenes, some of which are partof the imagination of Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa), who is a writerwho convey his own memories of events of the his recentpast some fictional, others absolutely true.  As he writes hevaries the tone and events in order to bring us in the audienceto a happier ending than he had originally planned.     The film centers on Lucia (Paz Vega), a waitress in Madrid,who suddenly dashes out of her caf‰ stating that Lorenzo, herlong-term, live-in boyfriend, needs her.  Receiving a phone callfrom the police that Lorenzo has been in a tragic car accident,she decides to wipe out her past life and start anew in the tiny,little-known Balearic island of Formentera off the Eastern coastof Spain.  There she is taken in by a guest-house owner andcook, Elena (Naja Nimbi), who has a relationship with a divernamed Carlos (Daniel Freire).  In her mind Lucia relives herpassionate affair with Lorenzo, gradually learning the writer'sdark side, particularly of his one-night stand with Elena whichresulted in the birth of Luna (Silvia Lllanos), a daughter he hadnot known he had.  As Medem's photographer, Koko de la Rica,trains a CineAlta HDCAM 24P camera on the characters in theblinding sunlight of the island and on the urban landscape ofMadrid, we are introduced to the circle of love that finds Lorenzoin yet another sizzling relationship with Belen, the daughter ofan ex porno actress.     There's plenty of sex and lots of Lucia in this metaphysicaldrama, featuring both male and female frontal nudity andconveying the impression that the best thing that happened inSpain during the 20th century was the death of Franco.  Whilethe film requires close attention, the symbols are simplisticenough, particularly the image of the sun and moon and sea alljoining together in a never-ending orgy of bonding.  While we tryto figure out which scenes really occurred and which are theproduct of the writer's feverish imagination, we think of theprocess of writing itself the way that the scripter, by pushing thedelete button and clicking away at the keyboard, can shapecharacters' lives any way he or she chooses.  We also find outwhy Europeans like telephone showerheads.  ""Sex and Lucia"" is anexperience. ",Sex and Lucia,NR,2002,2.5
808,"      Do you like massive conspiracy thrillers?  Well, what better placeto center it than right within the White House compound?  THE SHADOWCONSPIRACY, which has all the canonical thriller elements, plays like atypical television movie.  If you can't figure out all of the bad guyswithin the first ten minutes of the film, then you have not beengetting your daily adult requirement of mysteries.       As the story opens, a big guy (Stephen Lang) with a silencer onhis gun goes through a think tank killing everyone.  Well not exactlyeveryone, since Professor Yuri Pochenko (Theodore Bikel) escapes outthe back door.       Meanwhile, at the White House the president (Sam Waterston) is inthe beginning of his second term.  He did not rock the boat in thefirst term, relying on the latest opinion polls to form his everydecision.  He now has a speech he is about to deliver that will slashmilitary spending and will propose other radical actions that he thinksare good for the country.  He figures that, since he is a lame duck, hecan launch any initiative he likes.  Most of his advisers think thespeech will sink the stock market and have dramatic, negativerepercussions.       Charlie Sheen, who was so good last year in THE ARRIVAL, playsBobby Bishop, a special assistant to the president.  Bobby says histheory of governance is, ""He who gets the first sound bite wins.""Although he assisted the president with the preparation of thecontroversial speech, he will help the president's cabinet by gettingthe speech delayed and in the process will outfox ace reporter AmandaGivens (Linda Hamilton).  In the cabinet are Ben Gazzara as the VicePresident, Charles Cioffi as the Chairmen of the Joints Chiefs, andDonald Sutherland as Conrad, who is Bishop's boss.       The two stories quickly intertwine when the professor meets Bobbyin Georgetown to tell him, ""Something terrible is happening within thegovernment at the highest level.  There's an enemy within, a traitor.""       This setup for the plot happens in the first ten minutes.  Want togo out on a limb and guess what the ""Shadow Conspiracy"" is, and who arethe nefarious fellows behind it?       Right after his conversation with the professor, Bobby is shot atand then chased for the entire rest of the picture.  The ""good"" guyswant Bobby to come in, but Bobby smells a rat, or rather a mole, ormoles.  The film consists of chase scene after chase scene with Bobbyand, of course, the lovely ace reporter by his side.  You've seen allof this before and better.  If you come to the film expecting nothingand have your brain switched off, the film does provide enjoyable,mental pabulum.       A show with never a subtle moment has the requisite thunder andlighting.  The music by Bruce Broughton has variations on the mysterymusic you've heard a hundred times before.       Sheen and Hamilton try hard but cannot save the show.  Sutherlandis awful.  In one scene, where the tension is mounting, he rests hishead on his shoulder as if out of boredom.  You may be sympathetic withhis gesture.  The worse performance is given by Nicolas Turturro asGrasso, the NSA intelligence expert.  Turturro's Grasso is someone youwould not trust to have the brains to park your car.  In a show full ofimplausibilities one of my favorites is that Grasso is able withinseconds to redirect spy satellites positioned on the other side of theglobe to begin looking down on Washington.       Most of the problems with THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY relate to theweakness of the script by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs.  These first timewriters have set up ""numerous projects"" according to the press kit, andthis is just the first of many to be released.  I sincerely hope theothers are better.  Director George P. Cosmatos (TOMBSTONE) addsnothing to the picture, which runs on autopilot.       Providing all the ingredients of a thriller is not the same asmaking a thriller.  Nor will hiring a talented cast guaranteecompelling performances.  The show reminded me of my mother's fudgewhen I was a kid.  She would put in what she thought were the rightingredients, but it always ended up being a thick, brown soupyconcoction.  She never did find the right recipe.  Neither did thesefilmmakers.       THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY runs 1:43.  It is rated R for violence andsome profanity.  The show is a soft R and would be fine for anyteenager.  There is not much to the movie so I can not recommend it.Better to stay home and watch mediocre television than pay seven bucksto see an unconvincing movie.

809," Is E. Elias Merhige's SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE a vampire movie, or is it a movie about a vampire movie or is it a spoof of a vampire movie?  Yes.  And the film, which stars John Malkovich as director F.W. Murnau and an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe as ""actor"" Max Schreck, who ""plays"" the vampire Count Orlock, is deliciously funny as it takes itself quite seriously.  The clever script by first-time screen writer Steven Katz manages to eschew gore and rely instead on a wickedly humorous relationship between Murnau and the vampire, with whom Murnau has made a Faustian bargain.  In 1921 in Eastern Europe, Murnau is making a movie called NOSFERATU, starring a real vampire, who is given the stage name of Max Schreck.  Not telling his crew the truth, Murnau, a lab jacket wearing director whom the crew refers to as Herr Doctor, explains that Schreck is such an intense method actor that he wears no make-up, works only at night and is to be called only by his character's name of Count Orlock.      The director approaches the movie as if he were a blend of Sir Isaac Newton and Cecil B. DeMille.  ""We are scientifically engaged in the creation of memory,"" he lectures those around him.  After Murnau enlists local peasants for supporting roles, his producer, Albin Grau (Udo Kier), complains that they can't act, but the director sets him straight.  ""They don't need to act,"" Murnau barks at him.  ""They need to be.""  Actors in silent movies were forced to use exaggerated gestures in order to compensate for the absence of language.  Dafoe, in a performance worthy of Oscar consideration, has a blast chewing up the scenery in the silent movie-within-the-movie in which he spends a large portion of his screen time.  With knobby, pencil-like fingers, long, gray fingernails, dog-eaten ears and a bald head like a small meteorite, Dafoe looks so funny that you're ready to laugh before he even moves or speaks.  As the crew becomes suspicious, the producer confronts the director, demanding to know more about their lead actor.  On location for his first scene, the count emerges from a stone hole as the camera rolls.  ""Where did you find him really,"" the producer insists.  ""In that hole,"" the director replies, matter-of-factly.  The best part of the film is the bombastic chemistry between vampire and director.  ""I'd like some make-up,"" the count squeaks before filming starts.  ""Well, you don't get any!"" his director chides him as a parent would a bad boy.  In another, Murnau gets angry at his star for eating important members of the crew, which means that the production company has to bear the cost of replacing them.  ""Why don't you eat the script girl?"" Murnau suggests, since she is more expendable.  ""The script girl,"" the count says, pausing to think, ""I'll eat her later.""     Since in real life F.W. Murnau was a famous director who did indeed make a film called NOSFERATU, perhaps SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is more than a mere comedy.  Maybe it all happened just this way.  As they say, fact is stranger than fiction.  SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE runs a fast 1:32.  It is rated R for some sexuality, drug content, violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.   ",Shadow of the Vampire,R,2001,3
810," Old saying about truth being stranger than fiction was oftenbeen proven by remarkable films being based on true stories.One of such examples is a film that turned out to be one ofthe most underrated tear-jerking melodramas of its time.This film was based on the unusual events in the life of oneof the most influential thinkers of 20th Century. Thoseevents were turned into stage play SHADOWLANDS by WilliamNicholson and later adapted into BBC TV film in 1985(starring Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom). Eight years later,Richard Attenborrough, British director specialised forbiographical films, made feature film version.  The protagonist of the film is C.S. ""Jack"" Lewis (played byAnthony Hopkins), British writer who became famous becauseof his science fiction novels, children's books as well ashis very passionate defence of Christianity. Lewis' personallifestyle, however, is in total contrast with his globalfame - he lives a quiet, ascetic and uneventful life of aOxford professor, shares room with his equally asceticbrother Warnie (played by Debra Winger) and spends all freetime in intellectual discussion. In 1952 his life is goingto change when he receives a letter by Joy Gresham (playedby Debra Winger), Jewish American poetess who claims to be agreat fan of his work and wants to meet him personally.Soon, Joy comes to England bringing her young son Douglas(played by Joseph Mazzelo) and when meeting between ""Jack""and Joy occurs, British professor is both shocked andattracted by Joy's openness and directness. They strike up afriendship and that relationship gradually turns into deepplatonic love. Because of that love, ""Jack"" would agree tomarry her in order to help her evade deportation fromBritain. Their love, as well as ""Jack""'s beliefs would soonbe put to the test by Joy's illness.  Unlike previous Attenborrough's films that dealt with GreatMen of History like Churchill, Gandhi or Chaplin thisreconstruction of Lewis-Gresham love affair deliberatelyavoids visual spectacle. Instead, Attenborrough, quite awareof anything but spectacular setting, leaves most of the workto the actors. Casting is, naturally, perfect. AnthonyHopkins is excellent as quiet, reserved British intellectualwho would discover love in the autumn of his life. But thebest surprise comes in the form of Debra Winger, one of themost underrated actresses of past few decades. Her managesto show Joy Gresham as a woman who is physically attractive,but whose main tool of seduction comes in the sharpness ofher mind. Unfortunately, both of those great actors areunable to leave truly superb impression simply because theirroles in same way resemble their past achievements. Hopkinslooks too much like a reserved, ""stiff-upper-lip"" Britishbutler from REMAINS OF THE DAY. Winger, on the other hand inthe last segment of the film brings back memories of herrole in TERMS IN ENDEARMENT made ten years earlier. Theirinteraction is, however, great, and the rest of the cast issplendid, especially Hardwicke, John Wood and Peter Firth.Young Joseph Mazzelo as the only other American among almostexclusively British cast is also very good.

811,"  When Samuel L. Jackson learned that director John Singletonwas doing ""Shaft,"" his first reaction was, ""Why do we need a remake?""- which was mine, too. Gordon Parks's 1971 original, based on ErnestTidyman's novel, starring Richard Roundtree, was emblematic of thevitality of the blaxploitation genre, plus Isaac Hayes' thematicmusic. But Roundtree is back as the original Shaft, 29 years older -and so's the theme. Jackson plays his nephew, NYPD detective JohnShaft, a different hero for a different time, fighting against hatecrimes and drugs. His character's more volatile, ruthless andviolent. And he views violence in a different way. When things getdangerous, Jackson's Shaft kind of smiles, indicating, ""I can handlethis."" The plot revolves around a racially motivated homicide. Walter,a spoiled young college kid (""American Psycho's"" Christian Bale),kills a young black student, skips bail, and flees the country for twoyears - after hiring a tattooed thug (Jeffrey Wright) to kill the onlywitness (Toni Collette) to the murder. When Walter sneaks back home,Shaft finds him - but his father, once again, posts bail, so Walter'sback on the streets only, this time, he's after Shaft - along with twocorrupt cops (Dan Hedaya, Ruben Santiago-Hudson) and a Dominican druglord (Jeffrey Wright). Shaft's only allies are a colleague (VanessaWilliams) and a streetwise buddy (Busta Rhymes). Director JohnSingleton and writer Richard Price delve into the usual urban crimescene, predictably punctuated by street-smart profanity, and come upwith a disappointing conclusion. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to10, ""Shaft"" is a stylish, slick 6. It's hip and cool - if you dig that""It's my duty to satisfy the booty"" action. And a sequel's already inthe works. ",Shaft,R,2000,2.5
812," At last, a juicy, funny, romantic comedy - aimed at adults!Cleverly written by Marc Norman & Tom Stoppard and brilliantlydirected by John Madden, this charming story, set in 1594, introducesWill Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) as a young English playwrightstruggling with plots, characters, deadlines - and writer's bloc. Andhe's in competition with Christopher Marlowe, who writes for a rivaltheater. And his producer (Geoffrey Rush) is deeply in debt to thelocal moneylender (Tom Wilkinson) whose methods of collection areinsidious. Just as the future of their Rose Theater looks dire, awealthy merchant's daughter, Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), whoswoons over Will's sonnets, decides to masquerade as a boy (sincegirls were not allowed to perform on the stage at that time) andaudition for ""Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate King's Daughter,"" one ofWill's works-in-progress. She's hired immediately, as Will isenchanted with the recitations of his new ""Romeo"" until, of course, hediscovers he is a she - at which point the bawdy Bard slips betweenthe radiant maiden's sheets - but, by then, Queen Elizabeth I (JudiDench) has promised her in marriage to Lord Wessex, a cold, arrogantVirginia tobacco farmer (Colin Firth).  All's well that ends well and,if their escapades resemble ""Twelfth Night,"" that's no coincidence. Intrue Shakespearean form, there are mistaken identities, sight gags,ghosts, sword-fights, betrayal, lies - and a dog.

813,"      SHALLOW GRAVE is the movie that asks the question can three bored,young professionals who share a flat find happiness if they find a deadbody and a suitcase full of money.  According to the press reports,this Scottish movie is one of the most popular movies in Britain inrecent times.  It tells the story of three yuppies who live together inseparate rooms in a flat in Glasgow.       There is a doctor named Juliet (played by Kerry Fox who waswonderful in AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE), an accountant named David (playedby Christopher Eccleston who played the killer in GIVE IT TO HIM), anda newspaper report named Alex (Ewan McGregor).  The ""dead body"" isnamed Hugo (played by Keith Allen who played William Hurt's adoptedson's real father in SECOND BEST).  I loved the choice of names.Juliet was easy to fall in love with, and Hugo was easy to figure mightget into trouble. (To be fair about names, I should point out thatthere was only one king of England with my name (Steven) and that hewas arguably the worse of the lot.)       This movie is fascinating and has a whole series of great plot setups.  The filming is imaginative and takes many risks.  The actors andactress are good with the exception of McGregor who does Alex as thestandard obnoxious character you have seen done many times before.  Ithought Fox gave the most intriguing and fully developed performance--Ilook forward to seeing her in more movies in the future.  The smallpart of Hugo was the briefest but perhaps the best.       There is a lot good about this show and yet it is seriouslyunderdeveloped.  The characters start off fine, but then are not givenany memorable lines.  Many times the writer will create a scene quitewell and then do nothing much with it.  If they had written a muchstronger role for the police it would have added to the tension and thedrama greatly, but the police characters were just grafted onto theplot.  The movie seemed too concerned with style over characterdevelopment       The director (Danny Boyle) clearly wants to be the Hitchcock ofthe 90s, but he gets quickly lost.  We end up with a Hitchcock-litetale that has gratuitous violence a la Steven King or any slasher moviepasted on in place of a viable script.  The good news is that theviolence is contained to a relatively few number of scenes.  The badnews is that one of them seems to go on forever.       The movie runs about 1:37, but for the small amount of materialthey had, it needed to be 10-15 minutes shorter.  It is correctly ratedR for scenes of extreme violence that has the audience gasping aloud""Oh my God"" and for a little bit of nudity.  I found that even I had tolook away after a while during the long violent scene.  I don't thinkthis show is appropriate for teenagers.  I liked many parts of themovie so I gave it **, but I can not bring myself to recommend it.  REVIEWED WRITTEN ON: February 23, 1995 ",Shallow Grave,R,1995,2.5
814,"P>   What can you say about a Farrelly brothers movie that just isn't veryfunny? This romantic comedy revolves around the admirable idea that a person'sinner beauty outshines exterior appearances. Hal (Jack Black) is a pudgyinvestment-house employee and wannabe stud who drifts from one meaninglessrelationship to another because he and his portly buddy (Jason Alexander) onlygo for ultra-attractive women. Then, one day, Hal is trapped in a stuck elevatorwith real-life motivational guru Tony Robbins, who gives him an attitudeadjustment by hypnotizing him to see only the inner beauty in people. So whenHal spies obese Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow) buying lingerie, he doesn'tperceive that she's supersized, only that she's a kind, funny, caring person. APeace Corps worker who volunteers in the Pediatric Burn Unit at a local hospitalwhile waiting for her next posting, Rosemary also happens to be Hal's boss'sdaughter. Much to the bewilderment of Hal's friends and skepticism of Rosemary'sparents, an idyllic romance develops - until the spell is broken and Hal mustface the most important decision of his life. Written by Sean Moynihan anddirected by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the concept is inconsistent, the pacing isawful, and the laughs are few and far between, which may be why there's a crude,seemingly tacked-on scene in which Jason Alexander reveals a particularly grossappendage. Willowy Gwyneth Paltrow looks gorgeous in Hal's eyes and gross in herfat-suit. But bland Jack Black (""High-Fidelity"") can't match her style. The mostspirited performance comes from Rene Kirby, who has spina bifida and scampersaround on all fours. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Shallow Hal"" is asuperficial 4 - too shallow for its own good. ",Shallow Hal,PG-13,2001,2
815,"Following a pair of tonally lighter films (2000's ""Nurse Betty,"" 2002's""Possession""), Neil LaBute, a writer-director more famous for exposingthe bleaker, more disturbing sides of human nature (1997's ""In theCompany of Men,"" 1998's ""Your Friends and Neighbors""), returns tohis old stomping ground with the challenging and wordy ""The Shapeof Things."" Originally conceived for the London stage in 2001, LaButehas transferred his four original actors (Paul Rudd, Rachel Weisz,Gretchen Mol, and Frederick Weller) for this mostly successful cinematicadaptation, and their close familiarity with their roles is apparent from minute one.  Adam (Paul Rudd) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) meet by chance one dayat the museum where Adam works and Evelyn is about to deface a nudesculpture that has been needlessly censored with a fig leaf. Bothare graduate students at Mercy College, where Evelyn is preparingher art thesis, but otherwise do not really seem suited for one another.Whereas Evelyn is outspoken and beautiful, Adam is a little pudgyaround the edges and has no seeming fashion sense. Nevertheless, whenAdam questions their relationship, Evelyn responds, ""Don't worry about'why' when 'what' is right in front of you."" Pretty soon, as Adambegins to fall for Evelyn, he willingly takes her advice to changehis physical appearance and strengthen his self-esteem. In the process,two more characters become unintentionally embroiled in their questionablerelationship: Adam's engaged friends Jenny (Gretchen Mol) and Phillip (Frederick Weller).  What begins as an offbeat, rather lighthearted romance brutally seguesin the second half into something far more dark and unsettling. ""TheShape of Things"" raises several thought-provoking topics within itsquick 96 minutes, including the value of art, the importance societyplaces on materialism and conventional beauty, and the effect oneindividual can have on another within a love relationship. As Adamis subtly egged on (but not forced) by Evelyn to lose weight, changehis clothes and hair, and even get a nose job, Adam goes through atransformation that makes him feel better, but at the potential costof his longtime best friend Jenny, who has loved him for years. Sheand fianc‰ Phillip are visibly jarred by Adam's changes, and wonderwhy someone like Evelyn would be interested in him. All of this is,indeed, a setup for a key discovery in the third act that is almostshocking in its unblinking depiction of human cruelty. With the camera steady on long, unbroken shots, the actors are letloose to further explore their characters without the hindrance ofunnecessary edits, and each one of them delivers an exceptional performance.As total opposites Adam and Evelyn (all biblical allusions intentional),Paul Rudd (1999's ""200 Cigarettes"") and Rachel Weisz (2003's ""Confidence"")are so convincing it's scary. Rudd brings such an empathetic vulnerabilityto his role that what happens to him in the crucial last twenty minutesis almost difficult to watch. And Weisz is alternately alluring andmystifying, perfectly embodying the headstrong Evelyn, who may ormay not be exactly whom she appears. As counterparts Jenny and Phillip,Gretchen Mol (1999's ""The Thirteenth Floor"") and Frederick Weller(2001's ""The Business of Strangers"") add unusually strong supportto a technically sparse film with not a single other speaking part. As audacious as Neil LaBute's attempt to open things up is, he isnot always able to overcome the notion that this started off as astage play. With a total of only about twelve elongated scenes, thedialogue exchanges occasionally go on a little too long and featuresome stilted passages, while the blocking feels slightly too stagyat certain points. This is the movie's one debit, significant enoughto be mentioned but not so much that it destroys everything else that is so very good. ""The Shape of Things"" is grim in its look at what one person is capableof doing to another, but it is not heartless. The characters are sympatheticwithout having to compromise their flaws, and the literate, knowingdialogue is oftentimes exquisite. As for the centerpiece of the film,a climactic confrontation between Adam and Evelyn, Rudd and Weiszplay it to brilliant effect, and LaBute handles it with meticulousskill. The final moments are particularly heartbreaking, offeringno false pretenses or easy answers even as the viewer is led to believethere may still be a glimmer of hope for these characters yet. ""TheShape of Things,"" warts and all, is a motion picture not easy to shake.","Shape Of Things, The",R,2003,3
816,"People take away from meaty movies what means somethingspecial to them.  ""Shattered Glass"" reminds me of a thought Ihad some time ago when I was teaching full time and took on anight-school job as well.  Like others in my profession, I wouldbe making more money with two jobs than I would with just one,obviously.  But like others with the extra job, I was tired all thetime. As a result, my performance suffered in the daytime andsuffered at night as well.  I got to thinking: how ironic that themore money that people make by taking on extra jobs, the lesseffective they are!      As for how this connects to ""Shattered Glass,"" Billy Ray'sgripping account of a journalist for a respected publication who,like Jayson Blair of the New York Times, faked several of hisstories--27 out of 41, in fact (or should we say infiction)...Stephen Glass, who is indeed shattered by what he haddone, was just twenty-four years of age in 1998 when theexposure was made.  Like people who work more than one job,he not only worked his full-time grind at The New Republic,which for my money is the country's most respectable magazineabout politics: He took on freelance gigs with such high-payingmags as Rolling Stone and George.  But that's not all.  He hadthe distorted ambition to go to Georgetown Law School at night,which only a kid in his twenties could do at all given the heavystudy required and of course the presence in class.  How can hepossibly go out on assignments in and around Washington, D.C.such as a hotel convention of young computer hackers, take thenotes and interview the people, then submit an in-depth articleto his editor at The New Republic?  He can't and did not.  Hefaked most of the stories and, since he was well-liked at themagazine--he could entertain the staff at meetings as thoughtelling stories of the 1001 Nights and had a youthfulcharisma--he was given considerable support by his colleaguessuch as young reporters Caitlin Avey (Chloe Sevigny) and AmyBrand (Melanie Lynskey).  He was mentored by the late, greatMichael Kelly (Hank Azaria), who was later fired by publisherMarty Peretz (Ted Kotcheff) for personality clashes and forsiding with the workers repeatedly against the administration ofthe periodical.    With a dynamic, credible script from writer-director Billy Ray,whose film work so far is remarkably thin for a guy who couldpunch out and lead actors in such a dramatic work, ""ShatteredGlass"" carries with it as much tension as a good mystery, eventhough we know in advance that the faker will get caught.  Wewish beyond hope that the guy will get away with what he'sdoing because we in the audience are carried away as much aseveryone who worked with him at the magazine.       ""Shattered Glass"" is a must-see for everyone.  This should berequired viewing in schools of journalism from Columbia toStanford because it's not only a wake-up call against unethicalwriting but because we learn so much about the professionwithin the story's 94 minutes.  We find out--without thinking inany way that we're sitting in a classroom--that at a highlyregarded journal like The New Republic, a story does not simplyget written by a reporter and slipped into the magazine asthough it were a hot item that might be picked up by a tabloid'sextra edition.  In fact one wonders how a story can go throughso many employees that it remains timely.  It goes to thefact-checkers, then to editors who add a comma here anddelete an apostrophe there.  It goes to lawyers who make surenothing in the article could evoke a lawsuit.  Then it goes backto a few editors and a few fact-checkers and to the reporter. Oh, and to the lawyers again.     In the story Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen), on top ofthe world at 24, is sought out for stories about hackers and forcommentary about political conventions. He's big enough to tellhis assistants to send phone calls from George and RollingStone to his voice mail.  When he discusses his work, say, thehackers' convention, he gets up on the chair and gyrates toemulate the behavior of the acne-covered kid who has beenmade a hero by Geeks Anonymous.  Glass is an entertainer; heappears invulnerable.  To Hayden Christensen's credit, heconveys both the glow about his head at the beginning of theyear 1998, and the tearful, suicidal lad he becomes by the endof the year when reporter Adam Penenberg (Steve Zahn) of anow-defunct online journal, Forbes Digital, checks into the storyand discovers that the hotel in which the hackers' conventionmet on Sunday...was closed on Sunday; and that the restaurantto which the journalists repaired for dinner on Sunday...wasclosed at 3 p.m. as well.       We're not entirely sure about the motivation of this youngman.  Did he get a high every time he put one over on his editor,Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) and on the reading public?  Wasthis a crime of opportunity by a fellow who, after getting awaywith some small stuff, tested the waters to see just how far hecould go?  Or is the answer in some more banal fact, such asthe fact that he was overwhelmed with work from law schooland freelance articles?     Incredibly good performances abound, especially from HankAzaria as Michael Kelly, a journalist who, after being fired formThe New Republic went on to edit Atlantic Monthly and wastragically killed in Iraq this year; from Peter Sarsgaard as ChuckLane, who had a difficult time taking Michael Kelly's place aseditor given his lack of personality and the belief that he had noloyalty to the current staff; and of course to Hayden Christensen,in virtually every scene, who like a tragic Sophoclean hero orlike Ozymandias has his 15 minutes of fame only to fall intotearful disfavor. ",Shattered Glass,PG-13,2003,3
817," One of the great things about movie reviewing is thediversity of opinion. One man's masterpiece is another man'sjunk, both of them are entitled to express their views andthis is how the things are supposed to be. However, theauthor of this review, although he tries to live by thoseprinciples, recollects some situations when he was temptedto sacrifice his personal dissent for the sake ofconformity. One of such situations happened with the filmwhich is now considered to be one of the greatest films evermade and which happens to hold top spots in Internet MovieDatabase polls for years. Sheer numbers - high marks, plentyof people giving those high marks and the amount of timewhen the film holds the top spot - often give impression ofthe overwhelming force that single, dissenting reviewershouldn't oppose. Thankfully, when I first encountered THESHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, 1994 prison drama by Frank Darabont, Iwasn't aware of that. Initial high rating in Internet MovieDatabase didn't impress me; I thought that the enthusiasmfor the film is equal to those that elevated titles like THEROCK into Top 10 of IMDb and that it would vanish throughtime. I was wrong, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is now one ofthe most popular films of the past decade, but thatnevertheless didn't prevent me from keeping maintain myoriginal appraisal of the film.  Frank Darabon't screenplay for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION isbased on the Stephen King's story RITA HAYWORTH AND THESHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Plot begins in 1946 when youngPortland banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) getssentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wifeand her lover. Dufresne maintains his innocence but for thenext few decades he would have to deal with more practicalissues in Shawshank prison, all observed through the eyes ofEllis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), another""lifer"" who runs prison's black market and who wouldgradually become Dufresne's best friend. For the first yearsof his imprisonment, quiet ex-banker is ridiculed by generalprison population and often assaulted by the gang of prisonrapists led by Bogs (played by Mark Ralston). His fortunechanges when he offers his accounting services to sadisticprison guard Captain Byron Handley (played by Clancy Brown).Soon his boss, Bible- thumping yet utterly corrupt wardenSamuel Norton (played by Bob Gunton) hires Dufresne as hispersonal accountant, and in exchange for his help withembezzlement, kickbacks, tax evasion and other illegalactivities, he gets library job and other privileges. ButDufresne also uses his new position in order to improve theprison library and help making life easier for otherprisoners. However, although the life behind bars getsbetter through the years, Dufresne doesn't stop dreamingabout freedom.  At first glance, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION looks like a verygood film and could be hardly associated with first-timedirector. The dark, depressive atmosphere of the prisonaffects the viewers through the efforts of cinematographerRoger Deakins, soundtrack composer Thomas Newman and gooduse of old, defunct real life prison locations. The actingis also great. Tim Robbins is good as quiet, enigmaticcharacter whose agenda remains the mystery until the veryend, while Freeman gives truly superb performance as cynicalprisoner who is going to experience change of heart. Two ofthem have great chemistry together, but the supporting castis also very good and it ranges from veterans like JamesWhitmore in very touching role of an old ""institutionalised""prisoner to Bob Gunton who often played villains, but hardlyso convincingly as in this film. But the best thing aboutTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is Darabont's decision to employold-fashioned film techniques and not allow time constraintsto stand in the way of the storytelling. His indirectapproach, based on narration and quick flashbacks, worksfine in this film, allowing the audience to envision decadesspent behind bars more easily.  Taking all this into account, the author of this oftenwondered whether his disappointment with THE SHAWSHANKREDEMPTION had something to do with the subject matter andthe prison experience from his own past. However, after awhile, I came to the conclusion that there isn't directconnection between the two. Fortunately, my time behind barswas negligibly short compared with the protagonists of thisfilm and circumstances were completely different. So, thereasons why I don't share other people's enthusiasm for thisfilm come from my perception of flaws in the film itself.First, although the characters in this film are memorable,they nevertheless belong to prison movie cliches - sadisticguards, gang rapists, corrupt warden, protagonist's mentorwho ""runs"" the prison. Cliches later come in some scenesthat are supposed to be ""meaningful"" (like Dufresne playingMozart via loudspeakers) but in the end look trite andovermanipulative. All that culminates in the last segmentsof the film when Darabont tries too hard to wrap things upwith a neat little happy ending, which comes at the expenseof realism and looks too much like a deus ex machina. So,what was supposed to be gritty but uplifting prison dramaends like a standard Hollywood fairytale. However, THESHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is terribly overrated, but its plusesnevertheless outweigh minuses so the potential audienceshouldn't be discouraged from watching it and making theirown mind about its quality. ","Shawshank Redemption, The",R,1994,3
818,"      11-year-old Marty Preston has a predicament.  Since his family hashad to mortgage the house to pay the doctor bills of his recentlydeceased grandmother, his dad does not look kindly on the idea ofadding a canine member to the family.  (""No dog, no way."")  Even ifMarty could come up with the money to buy one, his dad complains thatthere are still the food, the shots, and the doctor visits that the dogwould require.       To further complicate matters, Marty has set his heart on theunobtainable.  He knows a local redneck hunter, Judd Travers, whoabuses his friendly beagle for not responding quick enough.  Thisnameless dog -- Judd only gives his dogs numbers -- has been christenedShiloh by Marty, and the animal has won Marty's heart.  Judd believesthe dog will be a great hunting dog so he refuses to part with him forany amount.       First-time writer and director Dale Rosenbloom's film SHILOHgarnered rave reviews when it was released earlier this year.  As afilm critic, I understand the marketing of non-family films -- I can'tsay adult films since the pornography industry has absconded with thatmoniker -- but the marketing and distribution of family films continuesto baffle me.  After these sterling reviews, Warner Brothers chose togive the movie only a limited release.  After missing such majormarkets as California's Silicon Valley, they gave up on the film andsent it to video.  With mediocre products such as THAT DARN CAT, ASIMPLE WISH and GONE FISHIN' getting a wide distribution, why couldn'tthey have promoted an intelligent family film?  Doesn't quality countfor something?       SHILOH is a richly textured film populated with completelybelievable family and friends.  It even has a villain worth hating andyet sympathetic too.  And then there is the dog.  Shiloh has ametronome for a tail, a sweet, slobbery tongue, big soulful eyes,playfully floppy ears and an intense loyalty.       Judd, played with crusty demeanor by Scott Wilson, was whipped byhis father from age four.  Judd makes his living by hunting, mainlyillegally, and views his dogs as little more that the tools of histrade.  Since he is single, he abuses them as his father abused him.In the backwoods town of West Virginia where the story takes place,this rings true.       After a wounded Shiloh shows up again at his house, Marty, playedwith touching sincerity by Blake Heron, devises a scheme whereby hewill hide Shiloh and find enough odd jobs to secure the money for hispurchase.  The fatal flaw, of course, is that Judd has no intention ofever parting with the dog, regardless of the price.       In less capable hands than Rosenbloom's the film could easily havedissolved into maudlin cliches.  The smartly written script makes for awarm hearted and realistic tale.  Typical of the film's strengths arethe depths of the supporting cast.  Michael Moriarty plays Marty'sfather as a stubborn and controlling parent, but one with a sweetnessjust below the surface.  His mother, played by Ann Dowd, works hard toearn extra money.  The battles between the parents, both on and offscreen, avoids the overacting usually found in disagreements amongparents in films.       Easily the biggest surprise in the picture is Rod Steiger'sheartwarming role as Doc Wallace, the local doctor and general storeowner.  Doc is the grandfather and guardian of Marty's girlfriend Sam,played by J. Madison Wright.  Sam has a big crush on Marty but managesto hide it most of the time as they pal around.  When she steals theinevitable kiss, he acts like he hates it.       The script is full of homilies inserted so naturally that youdon't realize they are present.  ""Don't ever run away from a problem,""advises the father.  ""Sometimes the biggest test of love is how muchyou're willing to fight for it,"" says the Doc.       Cinematographer Frank Byers shot the film in warm nostalgic shadesof browns and golds.  Amy B. Ancona's sets are evocative without everbeing overloaded with gaudy country nicknacks.  And Joel Goldsmith'smusic has a wonderful dreaminess to it.       The film has a long and completely plausible resolution of theconflict, but it seems at first to lack the tension needed to make itcompelling.  A twist towards the end changes everything.  The result isa completely satisfying picture with a touching little story, nicelyresolved.       SHILOH runs just 1:33.  It is rated PG for mild violence.  Theshow would be excellent for kids six and up.  Younger ones might havetrouble with the couple of scenes of a dog being kicked.  My sonJeffrey, age 8, liked the film ""very much,"" but added that it would notmake his best of the year list.  I recommend this fine film to yourfamily and give it ***. ",Shiloh,PG,1997,3

Close to his financialArmageddon, Billy has bet everything he has that his fighter and son, Eddie(Matthew Marsden), will defeat an American challenger, Mikey (Derrick Harmon),sponsored by Frank Spedding (Martin Landau).  The surprise of the plot is that the big match occurs in the middle of thepicture rather than at the end.  For all its violence, the movie is remarkablydull with only Caine making much of an impression.  My favorite scene has Billybragging to the police, ""I've been on the cover of magazines.""  To prove it, heholds up a magazine with his mug on the front.  The periodical's name?  In bigbold letters on its cover it says succinctly, ""Magazine.""     The only aspect of the film worth commenting on, other than Caine's acting, isPaul Grabowsky's compelling and evocative music.  Neither, however, is enough torecommend the picture.  SHINER runs a long 1:40.  It is rated R for ""strong violence, pervasive languageand some nudity"" and would be acceptable for most teenagers.  My son Jeffrey, age 13, gave the movie just one half of a star, complaining thatthe movie didn't give him any feeling about any of the characters.  The movie is available now on DVD and videotape. ",Shiner,R,2000,1.5

His step into the horror genre, however, came in 1980 with his loose, but exquisitely told, terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's novel, ""The Shining."" At the time of its release, King enthusiasts were disappointed because the film version had many differences from the book, but I doubt anyone can deny its overall power to scare.  With a running time of 144 minutes, it is obvious that this is no ordinary horror picture, but one that aspires to be an epic, and it definately is for the genre. Jack Nicholson stars in a tour de force performance as Jack, a writer who, at the start, is a family man who takes a job as caretaker at the Colorado Overlook Hotel for the winter. He is warned early on by the hotel's manager that the winters in the mountains are treacherous, and often the heavy snowfall closes up the roads for months. Soon Jack, his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their little son, Danny (Danny Lloyd) are left alone at the huge, desolate hotel, and as the weeks go by, the snow grows heavier, and Jack gets a bad case of writer's block, he slowly, but surely begins to go crazy. Meanwhile, it begins to get obvious that the hotel itself is indeed haunted, and as young Danny rides his bike through the endless corridors, he starts to get visions of terrible things to come, such as an elevator opening up to a tidal wave of blood. He also starts to see two mysterious twins who seem to be roaming the hotel, side-by-side. If you haven't seen ""The Shining,"" then I wouldn't dare give away how everything develops, but it is safe to say that by the last 45 minutes, all hell breaks loose.   ""The Shining"" is a deliberately paced, but endlessly creepy, horrifying motion picture. From the first shot of the camera moving overhead as a car drives down a road, to the shots within the hedge maze outside the hotel, the film has some of the most beautiful, atmospheric cinematography, by John Alcott, I have ever seen. Other technical credits are also superb, including the extremely eerie, memorable instrumental music score by Herbert Von Karajan, and the unforgettable production design by Roy Walker.  It is the overall experience of ""The Shining,"" however, that makes it such a great film. The slow pace at the start is actually an asset, because it gradually grows momentum as Nicholson starts to grow more and more crazy, until the movie totally takes off in it's last hour and turns into a funhouse of horrors. One particular scene is especially disturbing. Without giving it away, it involves Duvall and a person in a dog costume.  Nicholson's performance in this movie is probably my favorite that he has given, because he has the ability to have a very menacing present. I think it has something to do with his voice and his eyebrows. Duvall is very good as his sympathetic wife, and is a very good screamer when she has to be. Aside from Nicholson, however, the standout of the cast is surely Scatman Crothers, as the cook of the hotel who tells Danny at the beginning that he has the ""shine,"" which is the ability to see the future. In my opinion, he was sorely overlooked for an Oscar nomination in 1980.  ""The Shining"" is also very much thought-provoking, particularly the closing scene, and is one of the greatest horror films ever made. It is also a movie not easy to forget, and proves that when done well enough, and with a great deal of care, a horror movie can rise to a plane all its own. ","Shining, The",R,1980,4
821,"Lasse Hallstr_m's THE SHIPPING NEWS, a schmaltzy snoozer, is Miramax's canonicalweeper for the Christmas season.  I'm not a fan of Lasse Hallstr_m's THE CIDERHOUSE RULES, but it is superior to THE SHIPPING NEWS, which, even if it is basedon a popular novel, isn't much of a movie.  Filled with eccentric characters ofthe type that you never find in real life, the rambling movie doesn't go much ofanywhere and then stops randomly and abruptly.  There are the odd satisfyingincidents, but, overall, it just marks time.  Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), the story's central character, is a blue collar workerwho is devoid of confidence.  A fling with a stranger named Petal Bear (CateBlanchett) produces a child.  A pudgy-faced Spacey has never been made to lookworse, and Blanchett, in her hooker-reject clothes, is the complete opposite ofa soccer mom.    One day, Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) arrives on Quoyle's door.  Not long afterwards,Agnis, Quoyle and his daughter leave to go to live in the family home in faraway Newfoundland, which Agnis pronounces as Newfound Land.  The house is inruins and holds more than one deep, dark family secret under its rotting roof. They arrive in a huge, blowing June snowstorm, which nonpluses Quoyle and theaudience.  Agnis tries to explain how unexplainable the Newfoundland weather canbe.  (The most inexplicable part of the weather is the way that they go to bedwhen there is deep snow outside and wake up to find that it has almost entirelyvanished by early next morning.)  Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn), the owner of the small local newspaper, gives Quoylea job as a reporter, a position for which he feels totally incapable.  Jacktries to make it simple by describing one of the paper's guiding principles. ""We run a front page picture of a car wreck every week, whether we have one ornot,"" Jack tells Quoyle.  All Quoyle has to do is go to all of the car wrecks,of which there are plenty -- people drop like flies in this town -- and recordwhat he sees.  Although there are a few choice moments, with one of the best being an incidentto rival SHREK's outhouse scene, most of the manipulative film is completelyforgettable.  Perhaps those who loved the novel, which I've never read, will beequally pleased with its motion picture adaptation.  Personally, I didn't careabout any of the characters, and I had trouble staying awake since so little ofinterest happened.   Skip this syrupy movie.  If you have a sugar urge, bake upa fresh batch of Christmas cookies instead.    THE SHIPPING NEWS runs 2:00.

822," In my country, TV shows dedicated to seventh art tend to benamed after great or popular films. Our national televisionso far had two such shows - one named after A FISTFULL OFDOLLARS and another named after VERTIGO. Local television inmy home town adopted the same practices - for the past fiveor so years, the movie show is named after SHORT CUTS, 1993drama by Robert Altman. That film perhaps owes such honourmostly to its ""cool"" title, but it is neverthelessconsidered to be the one of the most important and mostsuccessful films of early 1990s.  The film is based on the short stories by late Americanwriter Raymond Carver. Script by Altman and Frank Barhydtchanged the scenery from Pacific Northwest and brought it toLos Angeles where the plot takes place few days before theearthquake. The film actually lacks the plot in the usualsense of the word - instead there are nine vignettes inwhich we are introduced to few dozen characters. All ofthose characters are faced with variety of problems whichare difficult but mundane - couple must deal with a death ofa child, husband has difficulties accepting his wife asphone sex operator, participants in the fishing expeditionmust decide whether to spoil their fun by reporting deadbody to police etc. Those vignettes are connected throughcharacters from one briefly appearing in another and theywould all end with the earthquake at the end of the film.  One of the most popular descriptions of SHORT CUTS is ""theshortest 3-hour movie in history"". This catchphrase, verypopular among 1990s critics, seemed impossible for many ofthose who followed Altman's career a decade earlier. Onceone of the most celebrated directors, Altman was practicallyexiled from Hollywood in the era of Lucas and Spielberg,since everyone began thinking about his films as ""tooartsy"", ""hermetic"" and incomprehensible to the averageviewer. Altman made a comeback with a style in 1992 and goteven with Hollywood establishment by mercilessly satire inPLAYER. One year later, Altman finally got his satisfactionby having one of such ""artsy"" and ""hermetic"" films beinglauded as one of the most important American films in 1990s.  SHORT CUTS in many ways resembles NASHVILLE, anotherAltman's film populated with myriad of characters and theirstories accidentally intertwined on the same place. However,this time Altman doesn't want to use satire in order toexpose specific cultural phenomenon (he would do it one yearlater in PRET-A-PORTER); his goals are more ambitious and hewants to expose modern life in all of its horror. He usescamera as god-like instrument that allows the audience tohave insight into the most private and intimate details ofprotagonist's lives, while in the same time he allowsaudience powerless to change horrific fates that await someunfortunate individuals in the film. SHORT CUTS is powerful,gripping film in which the black humour often intertwineswith tragedy - one of the example is the scene in which aboy gets hit by a car only to refuse the offer ofguilt-stricken driver to be taken to hospital, justifyinghis decision with the most sensible advice given by hisparents. Actually, all the misery in this film comes fromunderstandable, down-to-earth human frailties as well asequally down-to- earth and understandable twists of fate.  However, although Altman's masterful hands manage to keepour attention from the beginning till the end, SHORT CUTSdoesn't deserve all of the praise received by the critics.Since the material is so diverse, it is natural to expectthat some characters and vignettes would work and some wouldnot. Among the latter is the love story between alcoholicEarl (played by Tom Waits) and his long-suffering wifeDoreen (played by Lily Tomlin). Quality of acting alsovaries from vignette to vignette and from character tocharacter. It is interesting to find that the most powerfulperformances come from a relatively obscure actor like LyleLovett, while more established actress like Julianne Mooregets remembered mostly for her willingness to appearpartially nude in front of camera. Another distraction inSHORT CUTS comes from rather irritating musical soundtrackby Mark Isham and Gavin Friday, dominated by jazz tunes.However, although SHORT CUTS had its formula later used byother, perhaps even more successful and talented filmmakers,it still provides an interesting viewing experience andclear demonstration of the talent of a very importantAmerican filmmaker. ",Short Cuts,R,1993,3
823,"Since buddy movies, cop movies and cop-buddy movies havebeen done to death, Tom Dey, who directs ""Showtime,"" bills thisone as a parody of the genres, but whether you call a lemon anorange or not, it's still a lemon.  ""Showtime"" is  tepid stuff,making you wonder why De Niro would want to play the part. Helooks uncomfortable throughout perhaps because the pallidscript  calls for him to perform as a detective with littlepersonality, virtually no acting ability, a man who just want to beleft alone to do the job he's been plugging away at for twentyyears. In fact he looks most troubled performing opposite EddieMurphy in the role of a police rookie who wants to be an actor,De Niro's level of discomfort being perhaps what the part callsfor ((he's not supposed to like the person he's partnered with),or perhaps because he must step aside to allow Murphy toovershadow him as a flamboyant personality who collects all thefan mail to De Niro's sparse pickings. The odd couple, Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) andRookie Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) get paired up in a dealbetween a TV network and the L.A. police department. WhenPreston, known as a loose gun, or cowboy on the force, shootsa video camera dead during his investigation of a crime, thestation threatens to sue for $10 million but will drop the suit ifPreston and Sellars would agree to the demands of producerChase Renzi (Rene Russo) and director William Shatner(playing himself) to partner up and allow the TV crew to filmthem in action.  The laughs, such as they are, come fromSellars' preening before the camera while for his part Prestonjust wants the movie equipment out of his face.  Some titters areevoked from Preston's being kidded about his hobby, which ismaking pottery.  The comedy turns into some seriousexplosions as the duo go after a criminal named Vargas whototes a gun that's more advanced than anything the U.S. Armyhas. After De Niro's hilarious performance in ""Meet the Parents,""""Showtime"" is a comedown and for Murphy, still is a master ofcomic timing at age forty-one, a wittier script is sorely needed.",Showtime,PG-13,2002,1.5
824,"If you're a fan of hyphenate (in this case,actor-writer-director-co-producer) Edward Burns (""The BrothersMcMullen""), then you may view ""Sidewalks of New York"" as his tribute tothe kind of neurotic multirelationship romantic comedies Woody Allenused to make. And if you see Burns as an overrated, whiny frat boy withdelusions of grandeur, then you likely will dismiss ""Sidewalks of NewYork"" as little more than an occasionally amusing, often maddeningrip-off of the old Allen films. For years, NBC has insisted on taking the highly coveted 8:30-9 P.M.time slot on Thursday evenings and stuffing it with anemic sitcoms like""Suddenly Susan,"" ""Jesse"" and ""Inside Schwartz."" Imagine one of thoseshows, only three times as long, and you'll know what to expect here. As a framing device, Burns inserts a documentary film crew that pops upevery so often to individually interview all of the principalcharacters. These people aren't shy. The first interview is precededwith the warning, ""Some of these questions are personal and some relateto sex. So how old were you when you lost your virginity?"" Who are these guys? Burns apparently wants us to accept them as real,since he frequently shows us the view through their shaky camera lensand periodically has young men pop up in the background to harass thecrew. So how is it that they happen to interview every key cast member?Are the documentary makers psychic? And why, later in the story, do theinterviews move from the streets to the inside of the characters' homes?Clearly, these men are stalkers. Psychic, documentary-making stalkers.Aliens too, I bet. They probably make crop circles on the weekends. As for the story, the interpersonal dynamics work like this:All-American boy Tommy (Burns) gets dumped by his girlfriend Sue (CallieThorne). He goes to his lounge lizard mentor Carpo (Dennis Farina) foradvice and is told to wear cologne on his balls because ""chicks dig it.""Tommy tests the theory when he picks up Maria (Rosario Dawson) at avideo store. Maria has troubles as well - her ex-husband Benny (DavidKrumholtz, veteran of at least one NBC Thursday night sitcom) followsher around trying to play songs on his guitar. Benny also has a crush on 19-year-old Iowa transplant Ashley (BrittanyMurphy), who is dating a smarmy married dentist named Griffin (StanleyTucci). Griffin's jittery wife Annie (Heather Graham) is a realtor whoshows an apartment to Tommy, which sends another plotline looping into acomedic black hole. From all that excess emerges a few good lines, lotsof moaning and performances that range from serviceable to beyondembarrassing. Dennis Farina, what were you thinking? Whatever possesseda character actor of your skill to play a grating buffoon? Did thepsychic, crop circle making alien stalkers do something to your brain? That could explain everything. Maybe they got into the brains of thewhole cast and made them fall for this drivel. Or, maybe Edward Burns ISa genius and they got into my brain and convinced me that he is apretentious hack. Damn those aliens!",Sidewalks of New York,R,2001,2
825," For some decades now, it has been customary for collegestudents to travel, in the summer to Europe, during Spring breakto Cancun.  When going to Europe on an extended, two-months' vacation, two hetero males would often agree inadvance that if either one hooked up with a female of hisdreams, he would split and perhaps travel with her beforerejoining his male friend.  It's not unusual then, for a couple ofguys who have compatible tastes to separate, particularly underthese circumstances.  Imagine what it would like for two middle-aged men on a road trip, both, set in their ways, with baggagethat would mark them as a dysfunctional couple!  This is thefoundation of Alexander Payne's comic genius, in his new film""Sideways,"" using a script he co-wrote with his regular partnerJim Taylor, about a week-long odyssey taken by Jack (ThomasHaden Church), who is to be married at the end of the week andlooking for a final fling, and his former college roommate andbest friend, Miles (Paul Giamatti).  This is a relationship made inhell_that's how different these two guys are_and yet theirfriendship transcends what ordinary people would considerunworkable.  ""Sideways,"" which refers both to the way that wine bottles arestored and to the fact that the two characters on Payne road tripare not growing but, rather, moving laterally, is a movie forpeople who love words as well as for those with a taste forcomedy, both witty and vulgar.   Some of the misadventures ofthese pals are hilarious, others on the brink of sentimentality.Their talk is pretentious only when Miles discusses wine_andhere Payne satirizes the jargon of the connoisseurs_but on thewhole completely understandable to all who love movies madelike the great character studies of the 1970s.  Miles is the self-deprecating, gloomy Gus in this duo while Jackis high-spirited.  Miles, like Andre Gregory's character in LouisMalle's 1981 pic ""My Dinner with Andre,"" may not be as culturedas Andre but as Andre can appreciate great food, Miles is anepicure of the wine bottle.  Jack, on the other hand, issomething like Wallace Shawn. Shawn and Giamatti are similaronly in physical features, Wallace Shawn (like Jack, more orless) states that he is content with a cup of coffee, maybe aburger, and simply never thought much about his partner's morerefined style of dining.  As they traverse the vineyards of Southern California, staying inmotels on the way, even visiting Miles's mother for an overnightreunion, we observe Miles rattling on about the quality of thePinot Noir grape which_like Miles himself_is ""thin-skinned andtemperamental and needs constant care and attention.""  Jackwould just as soon slug the wine down, bottoms-up, as thoughhe were quaffing beer or downing a glass of cheap Scotch.While a good deal of the comedy arises from this mismatch ofpersonalities, the movie ascends to genuine hilarity when theyrun into two women, Maya (Virginia Madsen), a waitress whomMiles knew from years back who is going for a Master's inHorticulture and plans to run a vineyard; and Maya's friend,Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a slim, good-nature lover of thepleasures of the motorcycle and, as we find out soon enough, ofthe bedroom.  Just as comedy often involves psychological pain_the clownwho covers up his sadness by layering on it the big phonysmile_Miles's own pain evokes smiles and laughs from theaudience: not only the circumstance of his 750-page novelwhich never does get published though he advertises himself asA Writer, but also his inability to make connections with women;though he does quite all right for a while with Maya.  As director Payne traverses the Santa Ynez area of Californiawith his performers, we get to smile at the way elderly peopleare bussed into wine tastings, pretending to like the mostdifficult grapes (such as Pinot); the way that Jack, having toexplain to his fianc_ the broken nose he receives from a womanwho feels rejected, deliberately crashes Miles's car into a tree togive himself the excuse of a motor accident; the surprise we getwhen we discover that Miles, the Mayven of the Grape, uses thebottles to get drunk to escape temporarily from his low selfesteem and downright depression.  Alexander Payne, whose ""About Schmidt"" is a great humancomedy about a newly retired insurance agent who questionshis choices in life; and whose ""Election"" is a wickedly funnysatire on American politics, using a high-school contest to evokethe roadblocks put in the way of a candidate by a teacher; nowgives us a picture that is not bitingly satirical like the latter butmore about his later film.  Two middle-aged men contemplatethe choices they have made in life.  Given the provisionalsuccess that the divorced Miles has made with a woman who ismore down-to-earth than his wife, we have hope for him.  As forJack, he will not settle down, but given his randy ways andinability genuinely to commit will probably be divorced within twoyears.  ""Sideways"" is a tribute to the great character movies.Conversation is the entree, slapstick a worthy side dish.  Theymake wonderful music together.  ",Sideways,R,2004,3
826,"The publicity campaign for ""Signs"" has remained wonderfully vague. Wesee crop circles on the farm of an American family. We learn thatsomething very scary is happening. And that's about it. In that spirit,I'll do my best to reveal as little as possible here, but be forewarnedthat some thematic beans will be spilled. Those of you hoping that writer/director/actor M. Night Shyamalan hascrafted a worthy successor to ""The Sixth Sense"" should know right upfront that he hasn't. ""Signs"" is more reminiscent of his second film,""Unbreakable,"" with well-defined characters, a slow, meticulous,suspenseful build-up and a pay-off that will leave most viewers crying,""That's it?!?!"" Most of the film is quite entertaining, mixing scareswith welcome bits of humor. But the ending fizzles. There are two storylines: one involving an isolated family facing athreat from outside, and the other about a man's loss of faith. In bothcases, the presentation is gripping and the resolution unsatisfying. Set in rural Pennsylvania, the tale centers on Graham Hess (Mel Gibson),a minister who lost his faith and hung up his collar following thetragic death of his wife (Patricia Kalember). Graham now sticks close tothe family farm, raising his children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo(Abigail Breslin) with the help of his younger brother Merrill (JoaquinPhoenix). Shyamalan opens the film stylishly, with a shot of the backyard seenthrough a window in the house. At first glance, the image seems clear,but it is actually distorted by warps in the clear pane of glass. Forthe still grieving family, their already warped life becomes even moredistorted with the discovery of crop circles pressed in the cornfield.""Are you in my dream, too?"" asks Abigail, a gorgeous little girl knownfor leaving barely touched glasses of water all over the house afterdeciding the liquid is ""contaminated."" Gazing at the stalks flattenedinto geometric shapes, the asthmatic young Morgan says, ""I think God didit."" Graham meets up with a local police officer/old family friend (CherryJones) and theorizes that the circles are the work of a trio of localtroublemakers, but the circles look too perfect, and how did thecornstalks get bent without any being broken? Tension mounts that nightwhen an intruder is heard scurrying outside the house. The next day,Abigail announces that something is wrong with the TV, because ""the samething is on all the channels."" Seconds later, the family standstransfixed in front of the tube, watching a ""Breaking News"" report aboutan epidemic of crop circles all around the world. As the story builds, Shyamalan keeps the focus squarely on the family.This is going to be a small film, by God, no matter what he has to do tokeep it that way. And that's where things go awry. My logic-meterstarted buzzing during the first TV scene and went off at eachsubsequent one. Shyamalan, a stickler for detail, gets TV all wrong,presenting news reports that might have passed muster 50 years ago, butnot now. Consider. Abigail is watching TV when suddenly ""the same thing is on allthe channels."" And what is that ""same thing""? A report on the cropcircles, with an image of one in India. So we are expected to believethat every single TV station - network, independent and cable - chosethe same moment to cut to a single source for a report NOT of anemergency, but of a growing curiosity. That is simply not how modernreporting works. This may sound like nit picking, but it speaks to a crucial problem withShyamalan's storytelling methods. In ""The Sixth Sense,"" the worldproceeded normally while we saw the point of view of the two keycharacters. That was fine and fair. But in ""Signs,"" the Hess familymembers (and we) are fed only tiny fragments of outside information. Inreality, as the situation became more extreme, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN andseveral other news networks would be in fierce competition to cover thesituation, with an unrelenting stream of professional and amateurfootage, analysis and interviews. In ""Signs,"" the world adapts to fitthe needs of the Hess family saga. Shyamalan is determined to keep his story small. He has a clear place hewants it to go and he cuts off anything that might interfere with himreaching that end. As a result, our sense of being manipulated growsalmost as fast as the suspense, and the payoff, when it finally arrives,feels both contrived and insufficient. The other plotline, the one following Graham's loss of faith, is alsohandled in a troubling fashion. I will not reveal any specifics aboutthe resolution of the film, but as the closing credits rolled, I foundmyself thinking back many years, to when our minister told us that theessence of faith involves implicit trust without proof. If there wassolid earthly proof of God, he told us, it would negate the spiritualinvestment of the faithful. Consider this as you leave the theater. Even though the resolutions of both stories fail, Shyamalan still givesviewers a hell of a ride. ""Signs"" ratchets the suspense ever higher,with a number of dandy, if sometimes illogical, scares. And the dashesof humor offer relief without lessening the tension. I particularlyenjoyed the moment when Graham, facing a grim future, decides thatcomfort food for everyone in the family is in order. ""I'm going to makea bacon cheeseburger,"" he announces while wearing a fatalistic grin,""With extra bacon!"" As evidenced by ""Ransom"" and ""The Patriot,"" few are better than MelGibson at playing ferociously protective fathers (not surprising for aman with seven kids) and he does fine work here. Joaquin Phoenix iseffective as younger brother Merrill, although the lack of even thefaintest resemblance between him and his ""brother"" is almost funny. Thechildren are perfectly cast, which should come as no surprise to anyonewho saw ""The Sixth Sense."" Abigail Breslin is disarming as Bo, althoughher monotone""there's-a-monster-outside-my-room-can-I-have-a-drink-of-water"" linesounds less like something a child would really say and more likesomething whipped up for a movie trailer. And Rory Culkin, yet anotherof Macaulay's siblings (surely there must be a lab somewhere that doesnothing but clone more Culkin kids), gives a strong performance as thephysically frail but emotionally sturdy Morgan. In supporting roles, M. Night Shyamalan proves credible as Ray, arepentant neighbor, and Ted Sutton uses his few seconds on screen toleave a lasting impression as the intense, staccato-voiced Sgt.Cunningham. Wearing his director's hat, Shyamalan takes a vintage ""Twilight Zone""approach, with lots of skewed camerawork, while James Newton Howardprovides a dissonant soundtrack that punches at the right times. Despite the manipulation and contrivances, despite the lame resolutionsof the dual storylines, I still enjoyed the bulk of ""Signs."" I guess itis possible to draw pleasure from suspense even without a satisfyingrelease. M. Night Shyamalan has a real gift for making deliberatelypaced, thoroughly engrossing movies. If only he can become moreconsistent in how to wrap them up.",Signs,PG-13,2002,3

But hedid. Eventually, Simon grew into a little boy, fortified by thestaunch belief that God had made him small for a reason, that God notonly had a special plan for him but that he was going to be a hero.His story is related by a narrator, Simon's best friend as a child,now grown-up. We only see him twice - at the beginning and at the end- but it's this character, played with incredibly sensitivity by JimCarrey (who curiously gets no screen credit) that bookends thenarrative. Veteran screenwriter and now first-time director MarkSteven Johnson has created a cinematic fable, suggested by JohnIrving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany.""  Since the story begins in agraveyard in Gravestown, Maine, by the tombstone of ""Simon Birch,"" weknow that the pivotal character died at the age of 12, so the onlydramatic tension revolves around when, where, and how this tragedyoccurred.  The problem with the structure of the film is that it's soobviously melodramatic and manipulative. In the title role, IanMichael Smith, who is afflicted with a rare enzyme disorder, MorquioSyndrome, compensates for his ""vertical challenge"" with a trulymagical display of talent. And Joseph Mazzello delivers a trulyremarkable performance as Simon's best friend (the young Jim Carrey)whose single mother, played by Ashley Judd, refuses to reveal the nameof his father, thus providing the curious boys with an ongoingmystery. Oliver Platt and David Straithairn provide stalwartsupport. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Simon Birch"" is acharming, poignant 7.

Martin, who wrote the excellent script, plays Silasas a more positive creature especially after he gets his little girl.Whereas the real Silas Marner story dwells on the gold, this onefocuses more time on the interaction of Martin and the girl.  Overall,the original Silas Marner is a morose story, but with happy parts.Martin's version is much more upbeat.  Even the villains are not thatawful.       This is a wonderful and realistic movie yet with a fairy tale feelto it at times.  You can especially see this in the mystical andsymbolic balloon episode.       The high points of the movie are the ingenuity of the script andMartin's acting.  Mathilda McCann, the little girl, was played by AlanaAustin (age 11), Alyssa Austin (age 5), Alaina Mobley (age 3), CallieMobley (age 3), Victoria Evans (age 1 - 1-1/2), and Elizabeth Evans(age 1 - 1-1/2), and they were excellent.  The rest of the characters,especially Catherine O'Hara as April Simon, were all good.       The major problem in the show was the miscasting and misdirectingof the villains.

Sarah Michelle Gellar, who plays TV's ""Buffythe Vampire Killer,"" and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays TV's ""YoungIndiana Jones,"" both need a truly stellar vehicle to make the crossoverfrom the small screen to movies - and this isn't it. She plays aninexperienced chef and restaurant owner who, magically, is able to cookher sensuous passion into glorious cuisine after she meets this man ofher dreams. This idea worked for Mexico's erotic, enchanting ""Like Waterfor Chocolate,"" but it falls like a soggy souffle here. According to thecontrived script by Judith Roberts, briskly but routinely directed by MarkTarlov, Gellar inherits a failing 70 year-old TriBeCa restaurant, theSouthern Cross, from her mother. Playwright Christopher Durang plays acab driver Cupid as he, magically, utilizes an elusive crab to engineera ""cute"" meeting between Gellar and Flannery in a Manhattan Farmer's Market.Flannery's a self-absorbed retail executive in charge of opening a trendynew restaurant called Jonathan's in Fifth Avenue's tony Henri Bendel,and his temperamental French chef is giving him grief. Can you guess whathappens? Gellar's Crab Napoleon enchants him, but the standard ingredientsare all measured out: no surprises, no spice, no zest, no originality.Only some stalwart supporting actors - Betty Buckley, Dylan Baker, LarryGilliard Jr., Patricia Clarkson -  are trying the best they can. And,if you've seen ""You've Got Mail,"" you'll find the plot similaritiesstriking. Not that it's not pleasant. It is - but so bland that, if yougo, you'll soon crave something else.

831,"      SIRENS is a witty, fanciful, and wonderfully upbeat comedy with adramatic side as well.  It is the story of a painter (Sam Neil) whopaints nudes that enrage the church because some are deemedblasphemous.  A young enlighten Anglican priest (Hugh Grant) is askedby the Bishop of Sydney (Vincent Ball) to get see if he can get theartist to send just the non-blasphemous nudes to an upcoming bigexhibit.       The important characters, however, are the 3 nude models (ElleMacpherson, Portia de Rossi, and Kate Fischer), the painter's wife and,most of all, the priest's wife (Tara Fitzgerald).  The women, Ibelieve, are all relatively newcomers to the screen.  The show startsoff appearing to be about the painter, but ends up being about thepriest's wife breaking out of her shell and coming alive.  All of theperformances were delightful.  The nude models were played like pixies.When they smile, joy leaps through your heart.       Many great scenes in the show.  The pixies swinging in theglimmering moonlight was magical.  There was a drunk who said anunprintable 2 word phrase again and again that was very funny.  Thescene in church where the priest's wife realized how much she wanted tobe young and free was full of great images.       The cinematography (Geoff Burton) was superb.  The night sceneswith the exaggerated back lighting of the moon were lovely.  Thedirection (John Duigan) was perfect.  Duigan directed them so that itseemed as if these actors and actresses had been working togetherforever.       SIRENS runs a well edited (Humphrey Dixon) fast and lighthearted1:33.  It is rated R.  If a lot of female and male full frontal nudityis a problem for you, then skip SIRENS since it is best described as avery nude ENCHANTED APRIL; otherwise, I recommend this show to you andgive it ***.

Not to fear, it turned out to be non-stop intriguing dialog.The words per minute rate for the first part of the show is exceededonly by SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA and maybe by MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.       The script by John Guare deserves an award - witty and verybright.  You don't want to cough and miss a word of it.  The movie isbased on a play which I believe has the same name.  There are manymemorable lines.  My favorite has to do with what to give rich peopleand how simple it is.  See the movie to find out.  You never know whenyou may want to send Bill Gates a little something.

Note: Channing is nominated for an AcademyAward for best actress for her part.       The movie is a comedy in a way, but even more it is an evolvingmystery.  Most of all, however, it is a character study and somefascinating characters they are.  I am not giving any of the plot away- much better to be surprised.  The direction by Fred Schepisi of theensemble cast has them all in perfect rhythm.

833,"It's very important that you be in your seat for thebeginning of this psychological thriller and stay all the way throughto the end to comprehend the nuances of the twisting plot. BruceWillis plays a renown child psychologist who is emotionally tornbetween spending time with his lovely wife (Olivia Williams) andhelping desperately needy eight year-old named Cole (Haley JoelOsment), who is haunted by dark visions that terrify him. He sees deadpeople, restless spirits. These eerie ghosts appear everywhere - athome, at school, on the street - and they reach out, trying tocommunicate. Often they actually wound him. Cole lives with hisstressed-out single mother (Toni Collette), who is empathetic, but heis terrified to tell her his secret, to reveal his unexplainableparanormal powers. Then Willis comes on the scene. Slowly, the youngboy opens up to him. A trust develops, as the psychologist wrestleswith how the fragile child can cope with the harrowing, unresolvedproblems that surround him. Philadelphia-based, 28 year-oldwriter/director M. Night Shyamalan (""Wide Awake"") and cinematographerTak Fujimoto (""The Silence of the Lambs"") create an intriguing,elliptical visual style, building a melancholy aura of suspense andcreating a tense, slowly building menace. Combining his spiritual andmystical Indian roots with his American upbringing, Shyamalan achievesa subdued, provocative balance between what's real and what'simagined.  Bruce Willis drives the story with a strong, poignantperformance but it's Haley Joel Osment whose talent is anamazement.

834,"""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" stands as a testament that,with a clear-cut, original vision and a whole lot of unfailing persistence,first-time filmmakers can still be given the chance in Hollywood„alongwith a riskily large budget„to see their dream projects reach thesilver screen. Such is the case with Kerry Conran, who had alwaysfantasized about a grand-scale ode to rousing '30s serials and old-fashioned,adventuresome epics, but with a twist: his human actors would be filmedentirely in front of a bluescreen, and only in post-production wouldhe fill in the rest via extensive CGI effects. Working from home onhis crusty, old Macintosh computer, Conran created a six-minute testreel of what his extravagant world would look like, and based solelyon that he was able to find financing and big-name acting talent. The completed cinematic work that is ""Sky Captain and the World ofTomorrow"" is an utterly mesmerizing, boundlessly imaginative achievement,perhaps„and I do not use such terms lightly„the most visually astoundingmotion picture ever made. Set in, and seemingly made in, a semi-futuristicversion of 1939, the only giveaway that the film is a modern productionis its nearly seamless computer-generated effects. The film stockgloriously takes on the appearance of being grainy and sharply vividall at once, while the monochromatic color scheme is only one shadeaway from full-blown black-and-white. As for the actors themselves,they are specifically shot in soft-focus, their lusciously romanticized,dreamlike images moodily lit like the screen idols and sirens of seventy years ago. The world's most famous scientists are systematically disappearingone by one, and following an attack on Manhattan by an army of giant,mechanical robots, ambitious reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow)decides it is time to investigate the culprit behind these phenomena.Enlisting the help of ace aviator and wiseguy ex-boyfriend Joe Sullivan(Jude Law), Polly and Joe set off on a voyage across the globe insearch of the mysterious madman responsible, Dr. Totenkopf (Sir LaurenceOlivier, in an ingenious posthumous performance). The stakes are furtherheightened when they must also save Joe's right-hand man Dex (GiovannniRibisi), who is captured by the robots during an attack on their airbase. As Polly and Joe bicker and trade sarcastic remarks as onlydestined lovers do, they discover that Totenkopf's goal is largerand more potentially disastrous than they could have possibly expected:he is planning to end the world. From the opening moments of ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,""in which the Hindenburg makes its way across the New York City nighttimeskyline amidst the gentle fall of snow, it is instantly clear thatthe viewer is in the hands of true, honest-to-goodness artist. Writer-directorKerry Conran has envisioned a remarkable feast for the eyes, its accomplishedindelibility matched shot for shot by its sheer inventiveness. He,along with composer Edward Shearmur (2004's ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!""),pay fond tribute not only to the aforementioned adventure serialsof the '30s, but also to the likes of ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones,""and even ""Jurassic Park."" Ingeniously cementing its specific era toa further degree, Conrad uses a screening of ""The Wizard of Oz"" ashis backdrop for an important early scene set at Radio City Music Hall. Gwyneth Paltrow (2001's ""Shallow Hal"") and Jude Law (2003's ""ColdMountain"") make for a dynamic on-screen couple as Polly Perkins andJoe ""Sky Captain"" Sullivan, their romance airy but exceedingly charismatic.Paltrow is especially in fine form„sweet, determined, and charminglyclumsy. In a smaller role than her third-billing would indicate, AngelinaJolie (2004's ""Taking Lives"") enters the action during the third actas Captain Franky Cook, a fast-tongued commander of a British amphibioussquadron who shares some sort of past with Joe„much to the chagrinof begrudgingly jealous Polly. Jolie's part is brief, but she ownsthe role, her every line spoken a chance to snatch the spotlight awayfrom the two leads. It should be noted that, while the performancesare strong across the board, there is an off-and-on stiltedness tothem that may or may not be another intentional homage to the styleof classic cinema. It works within the context, but one wonders howmuch of this is due to the fact that all of their scenes were filmedin front of a bluescreen, acting off of nothing but their imaginations. ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is akin to a painting cometo life„visionary, gorgeous, and a couple steps away from reality.Because this is science-fiction, one couldn't ask, or hope, for anythingmore. Amazing, too, that the plentiful action set-pieces, includingthe robot invasion of Manhattan, an underwater battle, and the finaleat Totenkopf's fortress (its inhabitants should remain a mystery tobe discovered), are as stimulating and energetic as they are. Thereis palpable suspense built throughout, for once at the service ofthe story rather than merely to show off what can be done with today'stechnology. Furthermore, director Kerry Conran blends his actors intotheir surroundings with such a sure hand that, after a while, theviewer forgets altogether that what he or she is watching is the productof digital effects. ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" has tobe seen to be believed, and likely will be studied in-depth for yearsand years to come as an example of transfixing visual artistry andhow far one's creativity can take them in the world of cinema. ",Sky Captain and the World of Tommorrow,PG,2004,2.5

836,"SLAP HER ƒ SHE'S FRENCH, by director Melanie Mayron (""thirtysomething""),is a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of LEGALLY BLONDEand DROP DEAD GORGEOUS.  Starring Piper Perabo in what could be herbreakthrough role as Genevieve LePlouff, a French foreign exchangestudent who is Texas bound.  For those who thought after her leadingroles in THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE and COYOTE UGLY thatPerabo was just a pretty face, this movie proves them wrong.  Althoughshe's no Reese Witherspoon -- Who is? -- Perabo demonstrates someimpressive comedic talent.  Her co-star, Jane McGregor, is just asgood, and together they really know how to tickle an audience's funny bone. After a blink-and-you'll-miss-it scene in which the movie needlesslygives away its conclusion, the story starts with Starla Grady (McGregor)about to compete in a very Texas beauty contest -- a ""Beef Pageant."" Starla, a character with a Reese Witherspoon level of spunk, hasa secret weapon.  No, it's not the Vaseline that she rubs on her teeth. It's her strategy for answering whatever question they ask her onstage.  ""No matter what they ask, I'm gonna bring up God,"" she says. She's ready to kill the girl that steals this idea, leaving Starlato improvise.  In order to prove her generosity and overall sterlingcharacter to the judges, she tells them that her family is going tohost a foreign exchange student.  This idea proves to trump even God. When Genevieve gets off the plane, she isn't at all what the LePloufffamily expects.  As homely as homely can be, Genevieve is dressedin a Catholic grade school girl's smock and frilly blouse.  She wearsdorky, horn-rimmed glasses, a black beret and no make-up.  She isthe polar opposite of Starla, the head Hornet (which in proper Texanis pronounced ""whorenet"") of her high school's drill team.  Genevieveis mousy, shy and unsure of herself.  In short, she's a complete impostor. It's not giving anything away to say this.  The story makes it obviousthat she isn't what she seems to be, but knowing the joke doesn'tdiminish the fun one bit.  As Starla puts it just before her lifestarts unraveling, ""It doesn't get better than this.  I guess I shouldhave seen the signs, but the handwriting on the wall was in French."" Starla's big ambition is to become the next Katie Couric, so she istraining to win the junior anchorperson contest.  Starla, who sayswith all seriousness that ""Barbie is a role model,"" may or may notbe anchorperson material, but she sure is a brilliant contest competitor. Before she gets to the big competition, however, she encounters morethan a few unexpected roadblocks.  But there are no roadblocks tothe audience's enjoyment of this little treat.  Expect to laugh oftenat the story's good-spirited humor. SLAP HER ƒ SHE'S FRENCH runs a very fast 1:32.

They are to be renamed the Superchiefs, so asnot to offend Native Americans, and will become a clown team to be trounced inevery game by a group of Ivy League All-American boys called the Ice Breakers. Like the WWF, the teams are to play carefully scripted games, which they willrehearse in advance.  Claremont has even hired a gay Broadway choreographer todirect the teams.  Tough guy Sean Linden (Stephen Baldwin), the Chief's oldplayer/coach, hates the whole idea but might sell his soul for the rightprice.  How do you spell clich_?  The movie, which is sort of a sequel to George Roy Hill's SLAP SHOT from 1977,which starred Paul Newman, isn't sure what kind of film it wants to be. Generally it shoots and misses at being a broad slapstick comedy, with few ofits jokes scoring.  Most miss by a mile.  Sometimes the story wants to be takenseriously and expects us to feel sorry for the poor Superchiefs.  But, sincethere aren't any credible characters, the movie doesn't have a chance of movingus emotionally.

Both were filled with marvelousperformances and both had people in dire circumstances coping in waysthat earned the empathy of their audience.       The Cliff's Notes version of the film would be ""revenge,"" but ifthat makes you think of some cheap Charles Bronson action flick, thenthink again.  The revenge here comes much later and in much more subtleand surprising ways.  Although certain portions are shocking, this isnot one of those exploitive shows nor even one of the sensational, evenif excellent shows like PULP FICTION.       For the record, let me say that I approached the film as fiction.It is reported to be based on fact, but whether it is or not is in somedispute.  This is a great film regardless of its veracity.  In fact,the single best part of the film is the highly literate script byLevinson based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel.  There is just enoughhumor in it to break the tension, but the script is filled with movingprose.       The film, set in Hells Kitchen in New York, starts in the summerof 1966.  Told with heavy narration by Lorenzo, a. k. a. Shakes (JasonPatric and Joseph Perrino as the younger Shakes), he begins with ""Thisis a true story about friendship that runs deeper than blood.""  As heintroduces the friends of his boyhood, he tells us that ""Michael (BradRenfro as the younger and Brad Pitt as the older Michael) was the mostsexually experienced of us, which means he had kissed a girl on morethan two occasions.""       Although they are counseled against it by their tough priest,Father Bobby (Robert De Niro), the four friends: Shakes, Michael, Tommy(Jonathan Tucker as the younger and Billy Crudup as the older) and John(Geoffrey Wigdor as the younger and Ron Eldard as the older) go to workfor a Mafia boss named King Benny (Vittorio Gassman).  They are goodkids who go to mass and serve as acolytes, but like all boys,especially ones in rough neighborhoods like Hell's Kitchen, they havetheir wild sides.       As Shakes relates, ""the sun tapped out at 98 degrees on the dayour lives were forever changed"".  On that day they start to commit thepettiest of petty crimes, but their plan goes awry in arguably the mostpowerful sequence in the picture and one of the best this year.  Afterthat it is off to a hellacious year in reform school where the sadisticguards include Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon) and Ferguson (Terry Kinney).       When Father Bobby comes to visit them in the reformatory, Shakestells us, ""I couldn't look at him.  He might look right through thefear and the shame, right through to the truth.""       Also in the film is their friend Carol (Monica Polito as theyounger and Minnie Driver as the older) and Dustin Hoffman as analcoholic lawyer named Danny Snyder.  I am going to resist the urge totell you any more of the plot.  You need to see the movie.  Few filmshave so many actors displaying their talent so effectively.  I left thetheater nothing short of amazed at what I had just seen.  Exquisitelycrafted cinema.       In case you are wondering about the title, Shakes explains that,""sleepers was the street name for anybody who spent time in a juvenilefacility.""  He also tells us that after seven years your record ispurged so that you were never there and whatever happened, didn't.       SLEEPERS runs 2:32, but feels like half that long since your eyesstay glued to the screen.  SLEEPERS is rated R for strong language,brief nudity, violence, and believable but not carefully done scenes ofthe rape of boys.  Teenagers, if they go, should be older and mature.I give this film my strongest recommendation and rate it a full ****. ",Sleepers,R,1996,3.5

Which is? To go on ascavenger hunt initiated by one of the school's pretty but meanpopular girl, Staci (Sara Paxton), whose job other than namingthe articles that must be recovered (such as the handsomestboy's boxer shorts) is to emulate the looks and mannerisms ofReese Witherspoon.

The town'srent-a-cop played by Steve Carell is a bumbler and the kids'teacher could get into serious trouble if a snapshot taken of himwith Julie at his side in a nightclub is released. There's not a heck of a lot of wit, charm or originality in thiscookie-cutter offering.",Sleepover,PG,2004,2
840," Entering a teenage girl's bedroom, a group of renegade toy soldiers spot her collection of Barbie-style dolls on the shelf. ""Ooooh, fully poseable,"" leers one of the plastic warriors, ""Permission for R&R, sir!""   Based solely on its trailers, ""Small Soldiers"" has been dismissed by some as a ""Toy Story"" rip-off, but they're mistaken. Actually, it's a ""Gremlins"" rip-off, directed by Joe Dante, who also helmed both of the ""Gremlin"" films. Packed with comic mayhem and loads of pop culture references, ""Small Soldiers"" is enjoyable lightweight summer fare, despite its threadbare storyline and anemic characters.  Set in the same beatific small town where all the people in Steven Spielberg productions live, ""Small Soldiers"" deals with action figures run amuck. Implanted with computer chips pirated from the military, two groups of toys go to war, with the Commando Elite soldiers determined to eradicate the peaceful Gorgonites, and any humans who help them.    It's a simple, but cute concept that pays off with some big laughs, although the finished product doesn't live up to its potential, due to a number of poor choices from the filmmakers.   The human cast is painfully bland, just another group of sit-com stereotypes. There's the bumbling teen hero, his preoccupied father and ineffectual mother, the beautiful girl next door, her boobish parents, etc., etc. They're all sketchy as can be, making it difficult to care when they get in trouble. Only the late, greatly missed Phil Hartman makes any impression, adding what bite he can as the neighbor girl's loutish dad.   Okay, since we don't care about the humans, what about the toys? Here's where things really get odd. The appeal of a film like ""Small Soldiers"" comes from the wish-fulfillment notion of seeing the toy soldier battles we staged as children come to life, but it doesn't play out quite the way you might expect.   The Commando Elite soldiers are actually the bad guys, little military psychopaths out to defeat the enemy at all costs. And the Gorgonites, monster action figures with peaceful hearts, have been pre-programmed by the toymakers as timid losers. Their characters are sympathetic and appealing, but we don't get a chance to know them, because their programming ordains that they stay out of sight as much as possible.   Why would a toymaker program one of its armies to lose? I certainly have no idea. Why would Joe Dante make a film without sympathetic characters? Now, that one's easy. It's because Dante is far more interested in satire and mayhem than in people. As with both of the ""Gremlin"" films, he loves to fixate on funny, nasty little monsters, while whipping up colorful ways to destroy them.   Ultimately, comic mayhem is all that ""Small Soldiers"" delivers. Thankfully, Dante is pretty good at it. He uses the Commando Elite soldiers to send up countless war movie stereotypes. Look for satiric nods at everything from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""The Dirty Dozen.""   Speaking of the ""Dirty Dozen,"" don't be surprised if you get a strong sense of deja vu, as several veterans of the 1967 World War II flick turn up here. Ernest Borgnine provides the voice of Commando Kip Killagin, with Jim Brown as Butch Meathook, George Kennedy as Brick Bazooka and Bruce Dern as Link Static. Tommy Lee Jones heads the troops as leader Chip Hazard.  Keep your ears peeled for another mini-reunion, with ""Spinal Tap"" stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer providing voices for the Gorgonites. Frank Langella plays Archer, the spokesman for the gentle monsters.  ""Small Soldiers"" virtually bursts at the seams with pop culture references. Standing over a fallen comrade, leader Chip Hazard solemnly intones, ""his battery has died, but his memory keeps going and going and going."" A doorbell rings the key notes from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" one of several nods to executive producer Steven Spielberg. Dante even makes references to his own work, with ""Gizmo"" turning up as an online password.  Seamlessly blending computer graphics with live action footage, the film has a number of well-done set pieces. Particularly striking is a creepy sequence where the Commandos fit the neighbor girl's ""Gwendy"" dolls with computer chips, leading to a nightmarish Barbie-goes-berserk scene where the young woman finds herself under attack from her own dolls. ""Let's give her a makeover,"" says one psycho-Gwendy ominously, while another horribly mutilated doll coos ""Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.""  There's a lot of clever moments in ""Small Soldiers,"" but ultimately the film still feels like a warmed-over ""Gremlins."" Joe Dante has a real knack for cartoonish sadism and light satire, but he's covered this turf before. Had the human characters been less bland, or the Gorgonites less timid, they might have provided the spark to ignite this story's potential. As it is, ""Small Soldiers"" is another sterile summertime trifle, frenetic, funny and quickly forgettable. ",Small Soldiers,PG-13,1998,2

In thisManhattan-based story, Woody plays an ex-con dishwasher with TraceyUllman as Frances ""Frenchy"" Fox, his stripper-turned-manicuristwife. They concoct a half-baked, get-rich-quick scheme involving abank robbery that, as Woody puts it, leaves them rolling indough...but not the kind they had in mind.  Allen's theme revolvesaround the old adage: Be careful what you wish for - you may just getit. And his sly, observant script has more witty, literate dialoguethan you can hope to hear in a movie these days. There's no doubt thatWoody Allen is a comic genius, but his knack for casting just theright actor in the right role is second to none. This film marksUllman's third teaming with Allen; there's a rumor that her role wasoriginally offered to Barbra Streisand - but Tracey's terrific.  JonLovitz, Michael Rapaport and Tony Darrow provide slapstick comedy asAllen's three stooges.  Hugh Grant lends an aura of sophistication asan unscrupulous art dealer whose ""lessons in life"" aren't easilyforgotten and Elaine May almost steals the picture as an endearingdim-witted cousin.  Production designer Santo Loquasto and costumerSuzanne McCabe set a new standard for nouveau riche taste. On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Small Time Crooks"" is a delicious,delectable 10, one of the best comedies to come our way inyears. ""Small Time Crooks"" is filled with uproarious, contagiouslaughs - it's big time fun. ",Small Time Crooks,PG,2000,3
842," Despite being married to Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Guest still manages to write and perform outstanding pieces of comedy. Frankly, I find this amazing. Were I married to Jamie Lee Curtis, I'd just follow her around the house all day. Getting any work done would be simply out of the question (oh sure, I'm gay, but we're talking about JAMIE LEE CURTIS here, for God's Sake!). But enough about my post-adolescent fantasies. Christopher Guest, one of the creators and stars of the brilliant comedy ""This Is Spinal Tap"", scores again with ""Waiting For Guffman"", a very funny bogus documentary about the 150th Anniversary festivities in Blaine, Missouri.   Here's the set-up. The city leaders secure the services of transplanted New Yorker Corky St. Clair (Guest) to stage a musical celebrating Blaine's rich heritage (the town is famous for its wooden stools and a 1946 UFO landing.) Guest is a riot as the effete St. Clair, a delightfully clueless off-off-off Broadway veteran. In Blaine, St. Clair is well-known for his stage production of ""Backdraft"". To create a more realistic feel, he sent bits of burning newspapers through the heating ducts. Oh sure, the theater caught fire, but the citizens of Blaine appreciate the great effort St. Clair put into his work. They also seem oblivious to the fact that St. Clair is a screaming queen. After all, he's married! Well, nobody has actually ever seen his wife, but they know she's real because St. Clair has often been sighted in the Women's clothing department of local stores, and he knows a great deal about depilatories.   While Guest's performance is the center of ""Waiting For Guffman,"" there are many more pleasures in this affectionate, low-key satire. Check out the expressions on the face of Bob Balaban, a local music teacher displaced as director by St. Clair. Balaban says little about the nightmare he sees being assembled, but he seethes beautifully. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are also delightful as wanna-be performers who are as enthusiastic as they are untalented. The finished play, ""Red, White and Blaine"" is a real hoot. It's bad, of course, but it's the kind of bad that's a real pleasure to watch.   Several critics have attacked ""Waiting For Guffman"" as a smug, elitist slam on small town America. It isn't. ""Waiting For Guffman"" shows real affection for its characters. Most of the film's cast came from small towns and are all too familiar with the sheer weirdness of community theater. That peculiar mixture of little-to-no talent, combined with delusions of grandeur, is captured in all its glory here. ""Guffman"" isn't as funny as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" but few films are. Guest goes for a minor-key approach to humor this time, and succeeds far more often than not. Incidentally, be sure and stay for the film's closing credits, which contain some of the movie's funniest moments.   ",Smillas Sense of Snow,R,1997,2
843,"""Smooth Talk,"" which is the best independent film I have ever seen, won the Grand Jury Prize at 1985's Sundance Film Festival, then known as the U.S. Film Festival. It is an alternately funny, touching, tragic, unexpected gem.  Laura Dern stars as Connie, a bored 15-year-old girl who is sometimes naive and selfish, like most teenagers are, and has an unhappy home life, especially because her mother (Mary Kay Place) completely doesn't understand her. Her dad (Levon Helm) is often so involved in himself and his own dreams that when he talks to Connie, it is as if he is speaking a foreign language. She also suffers because her parents obviously prefer her older sister, June (Elizabeth Berridge). It is summer break, and all Connie wants is some excitement in her life. Every day she goes to the mall with her two friends and they slip into the bathroom, change into more revealing clothes, and run around the building like little children. She also decides to venture across the road from the mall and go to the burger joint where the older people hang out, hoping to find a boy, but it is obvious she is still too immature for a relationship. Connie briefly comes in contact with a handsome, but mysterious older man who obviously has an ulterior motive.  To give away the last 30 minutes of ""Smooth Talk"" would be criminal, because one of the best things about the film is the element of surprise at what comes at the conclusion. What happens is one of the most unpredictable, shocking things I have ever seen, but it leads up to a moment in the last scene that leaves closure for what had happened, and is one of my all-time favorite scenes in any film.  ""Smooth Talk"" is the best type of film. It obviously was made for not much money, but was written and directed by Joyce Chopra, based on the short story, ""Where Am I Going? Where Have I Been?"" by Joyce Carol Oates, with a great deal of delicacy and care. The screenplay is especially impressive, and perfectly realized, because not only is it perfect at being a ""coming-of-age"" story, and a ""slice-of-life"" picture, but the characters are also all written to be three-dimensional, and each one of them is given the chance to have at least one scene in which we really get to know or sympathize with them.   At the center of the story, however, is Connie, who is one of the most memorable and realistic teenage characters in recent memory. And what definately brings her to life is Dern, who is flawless in her portrayal of this girl who at one moment has the stature and ability to act like an adult, and in the next frame turn into this child. It is Dern's best performance to date, and was worthy of winning the 1986 Academy Award for Best Actress. The other cast members also couldn't be better. Berridge, as Connie's lonely sister, gives a truly poignant performance, as does Jill Inglis as one of Connie's friends whom Connie ignores once she starts hanging out at the burger place. The music by James Taylor is perfect for the movie, and fits very well, especially in the last sequence already mentioned, which makes the scene all the more powerful.   I wouldn't change a thing about ""Smooth Talk."" It is one of the few motion pictures I've seen that enraptured me in its story and characters so well that at the end, I was left with a lot of deep emotions and feelings about what I had witnessed, and also about the brilliance and subtlety of the last touching scene. ",Smooth Talk,PG-13,1986,4
844," Based on the acclaimed novel by David Gutterson, Snow Falling on Cedars, directed by Scott Hicks (Shine), is a sumptuous, meticulously poetic motion picture that refreshingly tells much of its story through strikingly beautiful visual images, rather than a lot of dialogue. One could complain that some of the characters are never fully realized, including the central figure of the story, but those that say such a thing, perhaps, have missed the point. The film consistently weaves in and out of the present and the past, based on people's recollections, and, as in real life, memories often consist of nothing more than pictures, rather than words.   Superficially a courtroom mystery, in which a young Japanese fisherman, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune) is being tried for the alleged murder of a man on a fog-induced night in the Pacific Northwest, circa 1950, what the film truly is, at heart, is a moving romance, as well as a documentation of the treatment of the Japanese, and their division with the Anglo population, sparked from World War II. Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) is a novice reporter who has returned to his hometown in the dead of winter (and a very heavy snowstorm) to cover the trial, which means much more to him than the usual news story because his childhood love and, he believes, soul mate, is Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), now Kazuo's loyal wife. As adolescents, Ishmael and Hatsue had fallen deeply in love with each other, but Hatsue decided, based on her mother's and the general public's belief, that the Japanese ""should stick to their own kind."" The majority of the residents of the small fishing town believe that Kazuo has to be the guilty one, but Ishmael suspects otherwise, and sets out to seek the truth, all the while pondering from afar about how his life might have been different had he and Hatsue followed their hearts ten years before.  Told out of chronological order, with flashbacks to Ishmael and Hatsue as children, teenagers, and Ishmael during and after fighting in WWII, and flashbacks within flashbacks, ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is just as effortlessly told as an Atom Egoyan film (i.e. 1997's ""The Sweet Hereafter""), and largely gains much of its effectiveness on the way the multiple stories beautifully and imperceptibly are revealed and transpire, akin to reading a complex, but very much satisfying, novel. Because the time period and storylines are changing throughout, there is no chance of any one of them (the trial, the romance, and the historical relevance) overstaying their welcome.   There are many dazzling, powerful sequences to be had within, including when Hatsue and her family, along with the rest of the Japanese in the town, are forced out of their homes and shipped off to internment camps, which is an example of complete bravura filmmaking. The scene looking back at the close relationship between Hatsue and Ishmael when they were younger is also superbly filmed and fastidious in detail. And the portrayal of the way the whites in the town look at the Japanese is also accurate and, thankfully, not overwrought. The music, by James Newton Howard, strikingly aids in underscoring the scenes.  There's really no way a person could possibly pen a review for ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" without mentioning its clearest and most worthy attribute, which is the exquisite, occasionally awe-inspiring cinematography, by Robert Richardson. Not only should the film be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination in this category (and deservedly, the award), but it many times left me in, basically, a wide-eyed gaze at the unbelievably beautiful images that were appearing on the screen, one after the other. Shots of rainy forests, and water dripping off of the leaves of plants, and snow-blanketed trees and mountains and whole, wide landscapes left me wondering if it was actually real (for it surely looked awfully believable), or billions of tons of fake snow, or a visual effect. Either way, never has snow looked as gorgeous and alluring and threatening as it does here.  The performances in the picture are not very flashy and, at times, are threatened to blend into the background. This posed a problem for me several times throughout, as I felt that the film was marvelously engaging to look at, but emotionally mute. Luckily, director Scott Hicks would prove me wrong immediately after each time my mind would wander to such a thought, with a stunner of a scene that left a precise dramatic impact. The last scene is particularly one of subtle, but unavoidably impassioned beauty. Of the cast, Youki Kudoh is a standout as Hatsue Miyamoto. She is so good, and so well-cast, that at times, her facial expressions say it all, and she doesn't even need to speak what she is thinking.  ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" probably isn't a film for everyone. While all mature audiences will be able to grasp its important themes and meaning, those partial to Hollywood movies with a lot of action or predictable comedy and romance will not be taken under its, overall, exquisite spell, due to a deliberately slow pace that cherishes and respects each and every one of its shots, and does not follow all of the rules of this sort of genre. Nevertheless, those audiences looking for a more challenging and intricate viewing experience will be genuinely delighted with the visual and emotional rewards that ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" has to offer. ",Snow Falling on Cedars,PG-13,1999,3
845,"Those entering a theater showing ""Solaris"" expecting a space-set thriller,complete with slimy alien creatures and action-packed battles, shouldlook elsewhere. The majority of the motion picture takes place ona space ship, this is true, and there are major hints of somethingsupernatural going on, but that is where its conventions end. Fora film in the science-fiction genre, and one opening over Thanksgivingweekend, no less, it is unusually weighty and ponderous stuff, requiringthe viewer's close attention and an open mind. Even then, some mayadmittedly still feel alienated. Written and directed by Steven Soderbergh (2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"")and based on the novel by Stanisalw Lem, which was first adapted in1972 by Andrei Tarkovsky, ""Solaris"" is a very deliberately paced andemotionally demanding meditation on the power of guilt, the valueof life, and the undying feeling of true love. As perplexing in itssubject matter as it is heartbreaking in its aftereffect, audiencesmay well stumble out 98 minutes later questioning what it is exactlythat they have just seen, and then won't be able to get it out oftheir mind for quite some time after. Set in the near future, Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a sullenpsychologist asked by an old friend (Ulrich Tukur) via videotape totravel to a space station orbiting the distant planet of Solaris andinvestigate a problem the inhabitants have encountered. Once onboard,Kelvin finds only two survivors, Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Dr. Gordon(Viola Davis), both of whom are for some reason resisting their returnto Earth. Upon waking up from sleep, Kelvin is visited by his wife,Rheya (Natascha McElhone), who has been dead for several years. Sheis not a figment of his imagination, nor is she necessarily the samewoman he was married to, so what, exactly, is she? Despite lookingand sounding like Rheya, and having all of her memories, Kelvin atfirst resists her return, and then starts to believe it may be hisonly chance to right the wrongs he made when she was with him on Earth. A thought-provoking mystery of a movie, ""Solaris"" offers few solidanswers and a whole lot of questions that it asks the viewer to answerfor themselves. At its core, however, are a number of issues thatare existentially dealt with in a beautiful manner. What would itbe like, for example, if a lost loved one returned exactly as theyonce were, but you knew they were simply a replicant of their realself? And how would you deal with getting a second chance to fix themistakes you made in the past? When Rheya returns to Kelvin, she isexactly as he remembers her: deeply in love with him, but burdenedby depression and suicidal tendencies. There is no way to help her,because his past memories cannot be altered, yet every time she killsherself she is resurrected. ""Solaris"" is intentionally languid and slow, soaking up and savoringits every plot point and nuance. The end result is something bothmystifying and beautiful, brought to life by a top-notch productionteam. The visual effects by Cinesite and Rhythm & Hues, although usedsparingly, are wondrously believable, and the sterile production designby Philip Messina (2000's ""Traffic"") makes great use of empty spacesand long corridors. Likewise, the cinematography by Soderbergh himselfalternates between richly textured, warm colors in the flashbacks,and steely, cold ones in the present day. George Clooney (2001's ""Ocean's Eleven""), usually one to play strong,suave types, is a revelation as Chris Kelvin. Clooney adeptly playsKelvin as a man who has suffered a great loss, and has not been ableto pick the right pieces up to move forward in his life. The internalconflict he is going through, and the external one he faces when Rheyareappears, superbly transpires through Clooney's heartfelt performance.  Natascha McElhone (2002's ""Feardotcom"") matches Clooney, yet has asomewhat trickier part to play, as she alternates between being thereal Rheya in the flashbacks, and another version of Rheya based completelyon Kelvin's memories of her. McElhone's interpretation of both figuresis indelibly brought to life with equal shadings of warmth and severehurt. Adding excellent support are Jeremy Davies (1999's ""Ravenous"")and Viola Davis (2002's ""Far From Heaven""), as surviving crew membersSnow and Gordon, both of whom are grappling with the sudden appearanceof people from their own lives. ""Solaris"" is such a multilayered and labyrinthine undertaking thatthe brief 98-minute running time could have, and should have, beenlengthened to further develop the rapturous story and its characters'pasts. The hefty issues the film touches upon are beautifully handledwithin the confines of the screenplay, but almost demand further scrutiny.""Solaris"" is the kind of film one cannot simply walk away from andnot think about. It is not only powerful, but the lasting impressionit makes is nearly unshakable. When Kelvin mournfully states nearthe end, ""I can't help but wonder if what I thought about Rheya waswrong,"" you'll know exactly what he means. The implications of sucha notion are staggering.",Solaris,PG-13,2002,2

Bulls, it turns out, can't be tricked.  Once they've serviced one cow, they are ready to move on to the next.  Repeat business is of no interest to them.  So, Jane decides, it must be thus with human male members of the animal kingdom.  The sweet and cute SOMEONE LIKE YOU is a whimsical romantic comedy which is compartmentalized into nifty sounding little chapters, including ""Establishment of Intimacy,"" ""The Vocalization of Emotions,"" and ""A Call to Arms.""  You may not laugh a lot, but you won't mind since you'll be too busy being charmed.  Jane, the producer for Diane (Ellen Barkin), a new talk show host with Emmy ambitions, falls head over heels for Ray from the moment he joins the show's team.  On the rebound from a spoiled three-year relationship, he returns her affection.  Just before Ray jilts Jane, she gives up her apartment to move in with him.  This forces her to accept the offer to share the apartment of the show's smart-mouthed writer, Eddie (Hugh Jackman), whom she loathes.  An obnoxious smoker who lives a life of casual sex with a different woman nightly, Eddie is Jane's exact opposite.  Judd portrays Jane as a shy, girlish type, who slurps on her straw, wears proper, little short sleeve blouses and can be coaxed into late night cheerleader demonstrations.  Just as in magnets, opposites, of course, eventually attract.  In one of her typical supporting character parts, Marisa Tomei plays Liz, Jane's buddy and counselor in the ways of love.  Liz is a failure with her own love life, but that doesn't dissuade her from dishing out non-stop advice to Jane.  Jane also seeks help from a nose doctor.  No, she doesn't want a smaller schnozzola.  She wants the doctor to inhibit her ability to smell since whenever she gets a whiff of Ray in the elevator, she is reminded of how he ""smells of soap, fresh laundry and vanilla,"" which drives her crazy.  As a way to work through her emotions after the breakup, Jane becomes a bookworm, reading everything she can on the male species in all forms of animals.  ""Men never fail to do what's in their nature,"" Jane cynically informs Eddie based on her research.  Through a suggestion of Liz's, Jane turns her hobby into a famous sex column, which she writes under an assumed name in the magazine for which Liz works.   Soon, everyone wants to find this mystery woman and interview her.  Director Tony Goldwyn (A WALK ON THE MOON), normally an actor, is certainly an actor's director.  Letting his actors establish their own paces and rhythms, he comes up with a natural feeling, relaxed film that's easy to enjoy.  Of course, having such a likeable star as Judd makes his job seem a lot simpler than it probably is.  SOMEONE LIKE YOU runs a fast 1:33.

848,"When was the last time you saw a star-studded studio romantic comedyin which both of the lead characters were over the age of 55? If you'rehard-pressed to muster up a single title from the last decade, thenyou're not alone. Exquisitely written and directed by Nancy Meyers(2000's ""What Women Want""), ""Something's Gotta Give"" travels throughwell-trodded territory, but it miraculously feels fresh because ofthe ages of the characters, and the intriguing themes th at go alongwith unexpectedly finding a soul mate post-menopause. It only helpsto have class acts Jack Nicholson (2002's ""About Schmidt"") and DianeKeaton (2001's ""Town & Country""), in her best performance in manyyears, inhabiting such richly drawn roles. At the age of 63, ladies' man Harry Langer (Jack Nicholson) has proudlynever slept with a woman over 30. When he goes with his latest girlfriend,Marin (Amanda Peet), up to her family's supposedly empty Hamptonsestate for the weekend, they are surprised when her divorced 55-year-oldmother, successful playwriter Erica Barry (Diane Keaton), and aunt,Zoe (Frances McDormand), come home to catch them in their underwear.And when Harry suffers a sudden heart attack and is forced to stayin the area while he recuperates, Erica finds herself forced intothe role of his caregiver. Eric a hasn't been in a relationship sinceher marriage ended years ago, and as she and Harry find themselvesconnecting on an unexpectedly deep level, Erica rediscovers a passionin herself that she had long since given up on. Complicating mattersis Harry's recluctance to be monogomous, even though the best thinghe has ever known is right in front of him, and his young doctor,Julian (Keanu Reeves), who is also attracted to Erica. ""Something's Gotta Give"" is witty, smart, and charismatically electricthreevital elements rare to find in most of today's romantic comedies.Stealing the show is an irreverent Diane Keaton, who hasn't been thisimpressive in a part since her Woody Allen heyday of the 1970s. Hercharacter of Erica is the foremost focal point of the story, and theemotions she finds herself going through as she falls in love whenshe least expects it are truthful and poignantly funny. Erica's ultimate love scene with Harry is an undoubted highlight,both sex y and appropriately imperfect as they fumble around in bedtrying to get a handle on each other. Their attempt the next morningto read Erica's wristwatch as they squint with their faltering eyesis real and funny. And in the way Erica goes through a relentlesscrying stage soon after things cool down with Harry, baring her soulin her play, Diane Keaton is downright hilarious, not just becauseshe is a skilled comedic actress, but because she has made Erica asympathetic, flesh and blood human being. As Harry, Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect in the kind of sarcasticsignature role he is famous for. At this point, Nicholson could probablyplay Harry in his sleep (unlike his heartbreakingly understated rolein ""About Schmidt""), but that doesn't make him any less good at whathe can do each time. The top-notch supporting cast includes KeanuReeves, breaking free from the humorless restaints of ""The Matrix""trilogy and really quite likable as the understanding, lovestruckJulian; Amanda Peet (2003's ""Identity""), natural as she brings multiplelayers to the somewhat thankless role of Marin; and the always entertainingFrances McDormand (2000's ""Almost Famous""), seen too little as Erica'stell-it-like-it-is younger sister, Zoe. ""Something's Gotta Give"" runs just over two hoursusually far too longfor a romantic comedyand it is a testament to the strong materialwriter-director Nancy Meyers has cooked up for her actors that thefilm never overstays its welcome. Its only misstep is an ending thatbypasses a potentially more emphatic conclusion for an obvious, predictableou tcome. Without giving things away, one has to wonder if the choiceErica makes at the end is the right one, or just another setup fordisappointment. It is a small debit, indeed, in a motion picture asconsistently entertaining, soft-hearted, and emotionally satisfyingas ""Something's Gotta Give."" People over the age of fifty do havesex lives, too, and Hollywood's acknowledgment of this fact was long overdue.",Something's Gotta Give,PG-13,2003,2.5

Determined to prove her worth, she venturesdeep into the rugged mountains of North Carolina, where her younger sister Elna(Jane Adams) runs a school. There in Bear Creek, she discovers a treasure-troveof traditional Scots-Irish and English folk ballads, given a uniqueinterpretation by the insular locals.   Excited, she sends for recording equipment and persuades Vinie Butler (PatCarroll) and other self-sustaining mountain folk to share their musical heritageon her Edison phonograph cylinders. Their music, as she puts it, is ""as much apart of life here as the air you breathe."" That's the main thrust ofwriter-director Maggie Greenwald's occasionally uneven culture-clash story,which is loosely based on Olive Dame Campbell's foray through the Blue RidgeMountains in 1908, but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice.

Of course, thetarget demographic audience is 18-30 year-olds - but even they weren't wildlyamused with the sophomoric attempts at humor. The plot revolves around threeKappa Omicron Kappa (K.O.K.) brothers -  Barry Watson, Michael Rosebaum andHarland Williams - who are unjustly accused of stealing the fraternity's""KOKtail Cruise"" money and evicted. No police report is filed, however, nor isthere an investigation. That would be too sensible.

So the dimwits dress up aswomen and are invited by a myopic sorority president (Melissa Sagemiller) -without rushing or pledging - to live at the Delta Omicron Gamma (D.O.G) housewhose feminist members are dismissed as ugly losers. Along with sex jokes anddrug jokes, the humor pivots on cross-dressing dilemmas: stuffing bras,teetering in high heels and applying cosmetics.

The rest is simply languorous, clunky, and out-and-out unoriginal. When Nashawn (Kevin Hart) experiences a terrible airplane mishap thatleaves his backside seriously injured and his dog dead, he promptlysues the company and collects $100-million. With his newfound wealth,he creates NWA, his own airline targeted toward African American passengersand complete with first-class and ""low-class"" seating and a hip-hopclub on the second floor. The maiden voyage from L.A. to New Yorkfails to go off without a hitch. Th e pot-smoking pilot, Captain Mack(Snoop Dogg), has never flown a plane before and is afraid of heights.Due to a canceled flight, Mr. Hunkee (Tom Arnold) and his family findthemselves the only white people on the plane. And Nashawn unexpectedlycomes face to face with his beloved ex-girlfriend, Giselle (K.D. Aubert),who is a passenger on the flight. Remaking great films that weren't exactly in need of improvementsor revisitation always runs the risk of having shameful results, and""Soul Plane"" is no exception. Whereas ""Airplane!"" held an endlessstream of one outrageous slapstick gag after the next, ""Soul Plane""screenwriters Bo Zenga and Chuck Wilson are not nearly as capableor ambitious in their humor. The film either reaches for the mosttasteless or potentially offensive stereotypical humor it can find,or just gives up altogether and actually tries to treat the storylinesseriously. These aims of sincerity, such as the romantic rekindlingof Nashawn and Giselle , fall flat as a pancake and have none of thezing that Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty had in ""Airplane!"" The comedy is, for the most part, not much better. Jessy Terrero'sdirection is strictly amateur-night, as he doesn't seem to have thefirst idea how to successfully set up a joke and pay it off with suchthings as tight editing, assured performances, and solid writing.Save for a few gags that do work„the ""Caucasian adapter"" toilet seatTom Arnold uses; the loud, tell-it-like-it-is antics of the airportsecurity guard (a scene-stealing Mo'Nique); the excitement the whitepassengers elicit when they find out the in-flight movie is goingto be ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood""„most of the comedyaims for cheap obviousness over genuine cleverness. Meanwhile, theslapdash ensemble of characters move in and out of scenes with nodetectable rhythm, some of them disappearing for inordinately longs tretches and others never even showing up again to wrap up theirrespective subplot. Sexual jokes involving loaded baked potatoes anderotic asphyxiation are especially embarrassing. Even viewed as nothing more than an intentionally stupid spoof (whichis what it is), ""Soul Plane"" is wafer-thin and instantly forgettable.Its innate meanness in stereotyping all races, ethnicities, and sexualitiesimaginable is lessened, at least, because nothing should be takentoo seriously to begin with. This fact, however, does not take awayfrom how piddling and dreary the experience of watching it is. If""Soul Plane"" succeeds at anything, it will likely inspire viewersto immediately rewatch ""Airplane!"" to wash out the bad taste thisnew movie pollutes into their mouths.",Soul Plane,R,2004,1
852," ""Off to the movies we shall go...Where we learn everythingthat we know...'Cause the movies teach us what our parents don't havetime to say."" That's the ""Mountain Song,"" which begins this rude,raunchy, animated musical, starring Comedy Central's most corrupted TVthird-graders. The cheeky tykes - Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny -bribe a homeless man to take them to an R-rated movie, ""Asses ofFire,"" starring a foul-mouthed, flatulent Canadian duo. Armed with ascatological vocabulary, which they don't truly comprehend, the boysstart spewing such profanity that their once-peaceful South Parkcommunity launches a vindictive anti-smut campaign which grows into anational movement, resulting in the United States declaring war onCanada.  In one of the most cynical vignettes, one of the boys has abehavior-modification V-chip implanted, delivering a severe electricalshock each time he utters a bad word. How is the movie different fromthe TV series? It's a musical with nasty, dirty parodies of ""The Soundof Music"" and ""Les Miserables"" with some inspirational ballads tossedin. Writer/director Trey Parker, along with Matt Stone, Pam Brady, andcomposer Marc Shaiman have devised a cleverly scathing, if crude,social parable, mocking our fear of and distaste for toilet humor,Satan, and Saddam Hussein, plus making some biting points aboutcensorship, tolerance, and freedom of speech. Celebrity voices includeGeorge Clooney, Minnie Driver, Brent Spiner, and Eric Idle. On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""South Park"" is an obscene, offensive,smutty 7. Warning to parents: this funny, fast-paced, irreverent filmpushes the envelope of its R-rating and, while childish, is definitelyfor adults, not children. ","South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut",R,1999,3
853,"""The Ripe Stuff,"" is what the newspapers called them when word leaked outabout their secret assignment.  Four old codgers, who left the space program40 years ago -- when NASA chose a monkey over a man to go into space first-- they are back for a quickly prepared mission to rescue an importantsatellite that will burn up soon on reentry if they don't get it back intoorbit.   If it hadn't been for John Glenn's recent space flight at age 77, the plotmight seem completely ridiculous.  Instead, the script makes the old team'sgoal and flight seem remarkably plausible.  After all, the ailing, ancientsatellite's guidance system was designed by Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood),and no one still at NASA knows how to fix it anymore.   Frank's only condition is that he gets to go into space to repair it andthat he takes with him his old team: Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), TankSullivan (James Garner) and Jerry O'Nell (Donald Sutherland).  Setting out acondition that he figures is unobtainable, Frank's hated ex-boss and currentNASA project leader, Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), demands that the four passall of the astronaut tests for physical stamina.  (These ""geriatric""astronauts are supposed to be about 69, but you'll notice that in real-lifeJones is a good bit younger at 53.  But with his usual weathered look, Jonesconvincingly plays a senior citizen.) Beautifully directed by Eastwood, the movie has two distinct parts.  Thefirst half is an inviting and good-spirited comedy, that is deliciouslyunderplayed and that rarely dissolves into slapstick.  The second half is anexhilarating action drama set in space. Just watching these old actors work together is worth the price ofadmission.  They have a blast, and we're there with them cheering them on. The brightly written script by Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner successfullycreates four unique lead characters.  Frank (Eastwood) is the team's cockyleader.  He's a take-no-guff kind of guy.  ""I've got Medicare,"" he says,picking a fight with an unsavory younger guy at a bar.  ""Go ahead, take yourbest shot."" Ethan Glance, played in a one-note performance by Loren Dean (MUMFORD), isthe hot-shot new astronaut sent to recruit Frank.  ""Dr. Corvin, your countryneeds you,"" Ethan argues.  ""Put a sock in it, Sonny!"" Frank shoots back.The tension between them doesn't ease up during training.  ""Excuse me, Ihold 2 Masters degrees from MIT,"" Ethan tells Frank, when Frank ignores hisadvice.  ""Maybe you should try to get your money back!"" Frank retorts with aclassic Eastwood sneer that would melt steel. Jerry (Sutherland) is a ""babe magnet,"" and a roller-coaster designer, wholikes to tweak his coasters himself.  With coke-bottle lenses, he has tocheat his way through the astronaut's eye exam.  The four's creative fudgingsupplies many of the best laughs.  There is also a fatalistic humor in thateveryone they ask about seems to have died. Rivaling Eastwood for the movie's best performance is Tommy Lee Jones, asdaredevil pilot Hawk.  Hawk spends his days taking up college kids inloop-the-loops certain to make them puke.  No one can fly a plane as well asHawk, but there's been bad blood between Frank and Hawk for 40 years now.   In the least developed role, James Garner plays Tank, a Baptist preacher.Tank, the group's navigator, can't even find his way through his ownsermons. There are lots of subplots, including a romance between Hawk and a NASAengineer (Marcia Gay Harden), and most of them work quite well withoutneedlessly complicating the story. The film's special effects are quite credible.  Looking authentic but notoverly glamorous, they nicely compliment the story rather than dominatingit. What a wonderful contrast this movie makes with typical movie fare thesedays.  Rather than having another in our weekly releases of bad-to-mediocreteen comedies, we have an intelligent and funny picture featuring people whohave real acting experience that's measured in decades, not years.   Let's hope that this starts a trend away from bad movies, whose only claimto fame is their demographics, and toward good films with experienced,really experienced, actors.  It's probably too much to hope for.  After all,we've raised a generation who thinks that all movies end in a prom sequence,and that all jokes must involve crude references to some bodily fluid. SPACE COWBOYS runs 2:00.  It is rated PG-13 for some language and would befine for kids around 9 and up.  It is also a good movie to take multiplegenerations to see.

If any one ofyou who as much as gives one kid an ice cream without at leastoffering another to the sibling: your  life is in danger.""    ""Taking Lives,"" is in every which way a conventional thrillergiven genre-friendly scenes, i.e. the killer refrains fromexecuting a coup de grace against the good guy until the lattergets the drop on him; the hostility of a local detective (in thiscase, a Montreal officer) to an outsider who takes charge of aninvestigation; the obligatory sex scene, particularly if the lovey-dovey pair are an unlikely duo given the situation at hand; a fewtwists coupled with the director's playing with an audience withscares, whether faux or genuine; a cop who manifests amentality not unlike the psycho killer's; and oh, a car chase withthe necessary explosion; mangled bodies; etc.     There is little that's original in ""Taking Lives,"" and even PhilipGlass seems on autopilot with generic music rather than hissignature, spooky vibes.     Filmed in Montreal under D.J. Caruso's direction, using JonBokenkamp's script from a Michael Pye novel, ""Taking Lives"" isabout identity theft with extreme prejudice.  The serial killersteals the credit cards and other marks of his murder victims,making sure that they are individuals without family ties, peoplewho would not miss them if they disappeared which gives Pye'snovel some of the resonance, but not the grace, wit, or irony ofJoseph Kesselring's play ""Arsenic and Old Lace.""  The city ofMontreal enlists the help of FBI Special Agent Illeana (AngelinaJolie), which in good-cop, bad-cop fashion leads to the hostilityof her new partner Paqeutte (Olivier Martinez) and thecooperation of Leclair (Tcheky Karyo).  When Costa (EthanHawke), an artist by profession, turns up as an eyewitness toone of the murders even drawing an accurate sketch of thekiller he is informally teamed up with Agent Illeana, a singlewoman who falls completely in lust with the sexy albeiteffeminate young man.     Ethan Hawke does his best with a slight stutter, a kind of BobNewhart lite, while Angelina Jolie waits for the appropriate totime to bear her bosom while wholly enraptured by her hots forthis artist.     There is scarcely a scene in the movie that's believable nordoes D.J. Caruso's by-the-numbers direction yield the slightestuniqueness of style. ",Taking Lives,R,2004,1.5
855,"There is only one possible good reason for going to see this movie: the Italian scenery-- the rest I wouldn'tdepend on.It has been presented as a tale about a fellow who treads upon everybody and everything to reach position and money, but it's not really that.John Ripley is not particularly smart and brilliant to create a life of his own.He is quite a dull calculator who takes advantage from the incredible set of circumstances that come to his favour.There is an attempt to picture the emotional aspects of his personality....we may ask ourselves is heattracted to Dickie Greenleaf? Does he feel something for him? Is it only his money he wants? Dickie Greenleafis  lively, witty, handsome (actor Jude Law) and affectionate,so it could be.....  This point could have been interesting but at a certainpoint it is dropped.There are apparently no strong emotions behind JohnRipley's actions and a character like that I find boringin this context.  From my point of view, I've had enough about serialkillers' stories.  Most of the time-- as this one turns out to be-- they are absurd, so absurd that the people sitting next to me in the cinema were laughing when themurders were happening (at least I hope they were laughing because theyconsidered the killing as out of place as I did). Never mind, I will conclude saying that with moreattention and analysis, The Talented Mr. Ripleycould have been a respectable movie.Unfortunately it seems that the director and scriptwriter didn't take much care to commit themselvesfor a good result!Some advice: if you want to go to the cinema...go to see something else.

856,"Are you familiar with the song, ""Friendship, friendship,/ Just aperfect blendship,/ When other friendships have been forgot,/Ours will still be hot""?  Presumably the composer meant the dittyto be taken optimistically.  We're regularly inundated with self-help gurus who tell us that having friends is the most importantthing in the world, and perhaps they're right.  But perhaps not.  Iffamiliarity breeds contempt, how about a familiarity that carrieswith it some profound resentment that one fellow has toward theother...even for an alleged event that occurred ten yearspreviously while the two guys were in senior year of high school?     ""Tape,"" a photographed play sometimes marred by dizzyingcamera pans and directed by Richard Linklater--is a filmcompletely different in imaginative scope from Linklater's""Waking Life"" and far more confined than his ""Dazed andConfused"" and ""Slacker."" Nonetheless the story is intermittentlyinvolving because the performers, operating in 86 minutes of realtime, keep the heat up.  Considering that the particular bitternessthat fuels the rage of 28-year-old Vince (Ethan Hawke) appearstrivial to anyone who looks at the decade-old event inperspective, Hawke provokes the theater audience to becomedisgusted with his immature ways.  As his foil Robert SeanLeonard performs in the role of Johnny, a young man who is inLansing to introduce his new film to an audience at the city's filmfestival.  Vince has come from Oakland for the weekendpresumably to support John's film, and when they meet--after wewatch Vince bounce around the room like a kid who forgot hisRitalin--he appears overjoyed to see his buddy.  After somebackslapping, the two show themselves to be opposites intemperament.  While Vince, an unsuccessful, callowadult who is a low-level drug dealer and volunteer firefighter isfull of off-the-wall physical activity, John is still pretty much theshy goody-two-shoes he was in his high school days.  Thefriendship between the two seems as unlikely as the bondingbetween Joe and Terry in Barry Levinson's movie ""Bandits.""     Both men are flawed characters.  The outwardly saintly Johnnylectures Vince that the latter should get it together and changehis life, a discourse that only increases Vince's negative feelingstoward his less demonstrative friend.  Determined to have thelast word, Vince hammers at the goody-goody--who had stolenthe affections of Vince's girl friend Amy (Uma Thurman) in senioryear.  Vince sees his opportunity to shatter the lofty self-image ofhis ""friend"" by making him confess to a criminal act committedagainst the girl by Johnny.   Ethan Hawke, fresh from a spellbinding role as the naive rookieto Denzel Washington's experienced detective in ""Training Day,""stretches his talent in yet another film that takes place during asingle day.  Where Hawke is the nice kid whose corruptibility istest in Antoine Fuqua's big-budget movie, in this claustrophobicplay he's a seedy guy with no ambition who is severely testinghis buddy's character, determined to keep the upper hand andcrush the spirit of the person who stole his girl.  Uma Thurman,playing the role of Amy and showing up in the motel room afterthe tension is immediately palpable, sizes up the situation and,smart person that she is sets the two straight.    ""Tape"" plays out the quintessential definition of theater: two ormore people figuratively (or literally) locked in a small location todeal with their conflicts.  As a staged play it does not compare invariety or interest with John Swanbeck's three-character ""The BigKahuna""--from Roger Rueff's play ""Hospitality Suite about twoworld-weary salesmen and a naive young colleague at an out-of-town convention.  Neither Hawke nor Leonard can compare withKevin Spacey or Danny DeVito.  Isn't it difficult to believe thatJohnny would masochistically stay in the room with the drug-and-beer-intoxicated Vince rather than  walk out a half hour before hedoes?

857,"When it was announced that fearless ""South Park"" creators Trey Parkerand Matt Stone were making an R-rated, all-marionette comedy as aresponse to today's uneasy political waters and the search for terrorists,those knowing what these two madcap geniuses were capable of wereunderstandably filled with giddy hope. After all, how many motionpictures have been quite as ruthlessly funny in recent years as 1999's""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut?"" Trailers for their latestopus have sold themselves on the notion that such outspoken, in-the-newspeople as George W. Bush, John Kerry, Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin,Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and Kim Jong Il would be very mad atwhat they see. The outcome, however, does not fulfill such a promise.For some, such as Baldwin, Robbins, and Sarandon, all of whom arefeatured with puppet representations, as long as they have a senseof humor they won't be terribly disturbed. As for Bush and Kerry,they are never mentioned nor do they appear as characters. In fact,the satirical strains running throughout ""Team America: World Police""are far too flat-footed to warrant much of a response from anyone. Team America is a renegade group of underground police who risk theirlives traveling the globe in their sole pursuit to wipe out terrorists.When Broadway star of ""Lease: The Musical"" Greg Johnston (voiced byTrey Parker) is called upon by the head of Team America to aid intheir mission„he is the only actor good enough to pass himself offas Middle-Eastern, despite his Caucasian descent„he begrudgingly agrees.With the rest of the world gradually turning against their cause,Team America move ever closer to the megalomaniac leader of the terrorists,Kim Jong Il, who has begun to sway the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.)activists to his side under misleading pretenses. Meanwhile, Gregstarts to fall in love with the brave Lisa (Kristen Miller), theirrelationship threatened by their respective hang-ups from the past„Greg'sfamily was once torn apart and eaten by gorillas, while Lisa's fianceewas murdered by a terrorist in Paris. Directed by Trey Parker and written by Parker, Matt Stone, and PamBrady, ""Team America: World Police"" has been over-hyped and misadvertised.Reluctant to pick a side or truly give any political figures or activistsa sharp lampooning, the film is spineless in not wanting to specificallypick apart today's political matters or make a statement. Viewed,then, as simply a raunchy comedy, the movie is not much better. Thereare some hearty laughs to be had„a love ballad that also thrashesMichael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" and its star, Ben Affleck, is one ofits sharpest jokes, and the wild sex scene between wooden puppetsGreg and Lisa has to be seen to be believed„but they don't come frequentlyenough. The majority of the comedy is more of the grin-and-nod variety,not assured or acidic enough to reach the uproarious heights it intends,and there are too many moments that fall flat for comfort. Primarily, ""Team America: World Police"" wishes to be a satire of thebombastic, overblown Jerry Bruckheimer-like action films, completewith non-stop explosions, violence, faux emotions, one-dimensionalheroes who are characterized by their expertise within the mission,and just about every cliche the genre is guilty of. Many of theseaction movie traits are played straight, the comedy sneaking in unexpectedlyand taking said cliches to the brink, but, for the most part, thefilm is just as forgettable as its supposedly serious counterparts.Much more successful are Trey Parker's sly comments on the physicalrestraints of making a feature film with marionettes. The way thatthey shabbily bop up and down as they walk, or make hand motions thatintentionally don't do what they intend, is funnier than anythingspecifically related to the plot or politics. ""Team America: World Police"" is a neat experiment, an interestingnovelty item that is a technical achievement. Looked upon as a big-screencomedy that requires quick-wittedness, memorable characters, and astrong plot, it is flimsy and undernourished. The characters failto endear the viewer, the comedy has a been-there-done-that feel,not nearly as raunchy or ballsy as one would be led to expect fromTrey Parker and Matt Stone's past projects, and the film finally implodesin a flurry of mindless violence, blood, and gunfire. ""Team America:World Police"" hints of an ingenious idea that, in its rush to be madeand released before the November elections, didn't have time to tightenand fine-tune a serviceable script to do it justice. The finishedproduct is discouragingly more flaccid and cowardly than it has any right to be. ",Team America: World Police,R,2004,2.5
858,"Ironic, how ""Tears of the Sun"" is occasionally so dark that the actionand characters appear as nothing but obscure shadows. Ironic, too,that a motion picture with such a poetic title isn't poetic in thefaintest. One part unconvincing, jingoistic war picture and one partmelodramatic, preachy hogwash, ""Tears of the Sun"" is a slow-pacedslog that adds up to not much more than a sour taste in the viewer's mouth. Muslim rebels have assassinated the President and his family, andgone on a killing spree through the war-torn countryside of Nigeria.Such a set-up, which reminds of the current political waters in Iraq,may or may not prove beneficial to the film's box-office receipts,although its overly sincere and often ludicrous particulars certainlywon't be helping matters.  To aid in rescuing Dr. Lena Hendricks (Monica Bellucci), an Americanstationed in harm's way, Captain Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) enlistshis Navy Seals platoon, headed by no-nonsense Lt. A.K. Waters (BruceWillis), to get the job done. While Lena is quickly located, she refusesto leave without taking all of the refugees from her mission withher. Waters balks at first, but after witnessing first-hand the savageryat work within the rebels, agrees to lead a dangerous trek acrossthe Nigerian jungles to safety at the Cameroon border.  Directed by Antoine Fuqua (2001's ""Training Day""), ""Tears of the Sun""is unconvincing in nearly every way. Its moral, which is spelled outfor audiences in a title card at the end, states, ""All that is necessaryfor the triumph of evil is for a good man to do nothing."" While sucha notion is all well and good, the movie bypasses subtlety in storytellingin favor of hammering home the point with undeserved mawkish sentiment.  It doesn't help that screenwriters Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirilloproven entirely inept at establishing and developing its characters.Were the viewer able to care about the people involved in the story,the syrupy final act might have held more resonance. As it is, protagonistsLt. A.K. Waters and Dr. Lena Hendricks are one-note ciphers whosebackgrounds are completely neglected in favor of a whole lot of wordlesswandering in the jungle. Additionally, cinematographer Mauro Fiore(2001's ""Driven"") apparently carried out his job with a busted camerabulb and no additional lighting equipment. The goings-on in the firsthalf are almost incomprehensible within their needlessly dim surroundings. In his second inauspicious war picture in a row, Bruce Willis (2002's""Hart's War"") should think about finding a different genre to workin. His A.K. Waters is paper-thin, and Willis is so uninspired asto almost feel like an extra rather than a lead performer. As. Dr.Lena Hendricks, let's just say Monica Bellucci is every bit Willis'equal. As for poor Tom Skerritt (2001's ""Texas Rangers""), he literallyphones in his performance atop the U.S.S. Harry S. Truman while endlessaircraft carriers hilariously fly by on every shot, threatening to drown out his dialogue. If nothing notable occurs in the first 90 minutes of ""Tears of theSun,"" then the final half-hour is a ""been-there-done-that"" battlesequence that succumbs into shameless bottom-feeding and a happy endingthat can't be bought for a second. If there is a compliment to begiven, it goes to Hans Zimmer's lusciously exuberant music score.The catch is that it isn't far removed from Zimmer's score for 1994's""The Lion King,"" a family film infinitely more intelligent and existentialin any five-minute section than ""Tears of the Sun"" offers in its whole.",Tears Of The Sun,R,2003,2

Theclones and Rosetta are all played by Ms. Swinton and asphotographed by Hiro Narita, their separate identities areflawless.

Just as theU.S. must seduce some strange people in Saudi Arabia to keepAmerica's lifeblood flowing, the young women need sperm inorder to keep going and they don't mind men who look likestrange people. They learn the womanly art of seduction bywatching old films while they sleep, movies like ""The :Man Withthe Golden Arm,"" and Ruby whose immune system is thestrongest goes out into what is called ""the jungle"" to get herfluid.       The kicker is that consciously or not, the mousy, virginal bio-geneticist Rosetta has created women who can do what shecannot.  She has no idea how to act romantic with men, leavingthe clones free to clue her in.  Despite the viruses that theaccosted men temporarily develop which require theirquarantine, all's well that ends well.  Love is the answer.     The movie is remarkably short at 82 minutes and comesacross mostly as a sketch for a fully developed comedy. Featuring the nerdy Josh Kornbluth (who starred in the abysmalego-trip ""Haiku Tunnel"" not too long ago) and the interesting Jeremy Davies as a lonely, mama's boy-xeroxer who ironicallylacks experience in reproducing (and who was hilarious in""Spanking the Monkey""), ""Teknolust"" gets an A for creativity butis difficult to feel other than respect for the job rather than whatis prescribed for all of us--love. ",Teknolust,NR,2002,2.5

It wasn't Charlie Sheen,whose charisma and couple of wisecracking lines actuallysaved this film, turning it into unintentional comedy. Thebiggest disappointment was Nastassja Kinski, who obviouslychose wrong film for her great comeback into the movieindustry. Although she looks charming, she is anything butbelievable as tough intelligence operative, Russian to makethings even more interesting. Villains are more convincing,as usual, although the main ones - played by JamesGandolfini and Christopher MacDonald - doesn't look likeRussian at all. However, although definitely and justifiablyforgettable, TERMINAL VELOCITY is a film that can providesome entertainment for not very demanding audience. ",Terminal Velocity,PG-13,1994,1
861,"A motion picture that starts off with a quirkily original premisebefore completely derailing in shallow subplots that go nowhere anda loathsome conclusion that wants, but fails, to be uplifting, ""TheTerminal"" might possibly be director Steven Spielberg's (2002's ""CatchMe If You Can"") weakest film to date. In its plot of a man who findshimself stranded for an inordinately long time with dwindling hopeof being able to escape, and in many of its smaller details, ""TheTerminal"" unintentionally recalls 2000's powerful ""Cast Away,"" alsostarring Tom Hanks. In place of an island, however, is an airportterminal, and in place of that aforementioned masterpiece's humanismand profundity is little more than cutesy storytelling and off-putting,one-dimensional characters. At nearly the exact moment Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) first arrivesin New York City, a war breaks out in his Eastern European homeland,veritably shattering his own country's existence. Suddenly withouta home to call his home or an acceptable visa, Viktor„who speaks littleEnglish„is instructed by head of homeland security Fran k Dixon (StanleyTucci) to remain within the walls of the airport terminal until eitherthe federal government grants the proper clearance or his countryreclaims its name. Viktor, a resilient, good-natured man, obliges,at first teaching himself English and finding ways to make money toeat. He befriends some of the lowly staff, including jokey janitorGupta (Kumar Pallana), straight-talking security officer Mulroy (ChiMcBride), and lovestruck kitchen worker Cruz (Diego Luna) who hashis eyes on sweet INS agent Torres (Zoe Saldana). As weeks stuck inthe airport turn to months, Viktor gets to know beautiful flight attendantAmelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a workaholic unhappily havingan affair with a married man. Gradually, they form a romantic connection.Meanwhile, Viktor becomes determined to reach the outside world ofManhattan to fulfill a secret goal that, in time, will be revealed. The lackluster screenplay by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (2001's""Rush Hour 2"") is only one of many glaring deficiencies that plague""The Terminal,"" but it is the most calamitous. The ragtag stream ofinterwoven storylines are either seriously undernourished, unnecessarilylong-winded, utterly pointless, or all of the above. For example,the way in which the potential romance between Cruz and Torres isinitially set up, with Viktor put in the role of go-between matchmakerin exchange for food, is pleasing enough, but its payoff is alarminglyirrational and not to be believed for a second. As for the sort-oflove story between Viktor and Amelia, it holds all of the emotionalweight of a paper bag and its despicable, cheap outcome is the equivalentof driving freely down a road and smashing into a brick wall. If therewas supposed to be any point to the Viktor-Amelia scenes, and anyinternal growth for either party based on their relationship, it musthave been lost in the trans lation from page to screen. Save for the memorable Viktor Navorski, who is in almost every sceneand played deliciously and with astounding adeptness and soul by TomHanks, all of the characters fall into one of two camps: they arewritten and portrayed as either dim-witted clowns, too cute by a halfas they strain for throwaway laughs, or as unlikable, one-note caricatureswho make baselessly bad decisions. So lacking in depth and consistencyare these people that they give America, for which they are intendedto stand for, a very bad name, indeed. If I were Viktor Navorski,had never stepped foot on United States soil, and was faced with thesefools, I would see it as a blessing if I never got to see the outsideworld of New York City. This very fact is ruinous to the climax, turningwhat should have been lovely and poignant and emotionally resoundinginto a series of flat, uninteresting, meaningless scenes. As the confused Amelia Warren, who is torn between a man sh e knowsshe probably shouldn't be with and a man she knows she probably can'tever be with, Catherine Zeta-Jones (2003's ""Intolerable Cruelty"")is stunningly bad in an admittedly thankless role. She is stiff, shehas trouble emoting, and she never makes it plausible why she findsViktor so attractive. The audience knows the answer to this question,yes, but Zeta-Jones is unconvincing in making the viewer believe it.The unsatisfactory way in which her character is dealt with in thethird act would seem like a betrayal if she had been likable or charmingto begin with, but she never was. ""The Terminal"" is a big-screen bust, and in a big way. After all,it is not often that director Steven Spielberg is responsible forsuch a mess of a film. What is certain, at least, is that comedy isnot his forte. For much of the running time, it almost seemed as ifthe falsely sentimental Garry Marshall (2004's ""Raising Helen"") wasat the helm, rather than Spielberg. The dramatic moments want to betouching, but are only mawkish, while the comedic bits are more banalthan clever, the only funny moments coming solely from Hanks' sterlingcomic talents. Even the cinematography by Spielberg regular JanuszKaminski (2002's ""Minority Report"") is genuinely dreary to look out,with the color scheme prevelant in boring pale blues and grays andthe film itself jarringly overexposed. At some points, the glaresfrom the light sources even threaten to drown out the characters.It is a real shame that such a fine performance from Tom Hanks isat the service of an otherwise unrewarding cinematic experience. Atleast the title is fitting. With every minute that ticks by, ""TheTerminal""„a hate letter to America for no valid reason„moves all thecloser to its own ultimate fatality. By the end, the film is as good as pronounced dead.","Terminal, The",PG-13,2004,3
862,"Remember when the first computers came out in the U.S. notthe ones used only by academic researchers and the militarybut the ones we could put to our own use at home and inschool? Recall the excitement we had doing what would nowbe considered elementary, such as highlighting a paragraph,moving it up in our reports, and pasting it wherever we wanted? And how we built home pages, putting in our own photos, ourown poems and samples of our philosophy? We can still do allthat, but the thrill of the novel, while not gone, is now not reallythere. With chat rooms that allow us to talk in real time withfriends in Australia without giving the phone company more thanthe price of a local call, with 3 billion internet pages searchableby google that make a mockery of our own little home pages,with speedy broadband allowing us to see video clips inmoments rather than waiting a half hour or so to download, wenow appreciate the convenience, but again: the thrill of thebrand new is out. This is perhaps why sequels may be evenmore awesome than the original movies (given advances intechnology) but do not usually delight us as much as earlierrenditions. That's the way you may feel when you leave ""Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines,"" particularly if you've taken in eitherJames Cameron's T1 (1984) or the same director's Terminator2: Judgment Day,"" which came out in 1991. While ArnoldSchwarzenegger is boldly featured in all three and is lookingbuff as ever at the age of 55, the plot lines are about the sameand what's more, though Arnold can knock off a few witty linesas only he with his dry humor can, ""T3"" relies all to much on itsfirepower: its digital computer activity, its smashing stunt work,its scenes of absolutely mayhem that would have put ""Hulk"" inhis place before he took a step. The film deserves its grade of""B"" based on its delightfully anarchistic sensibility: smashing,pushing, swinging, burning, blowing up to such an extent that ifSchwarzenegger makes it to the California governor's mansion,he'll nothing to administer but an extended Mojave Desert. In ""T3,"" with Jonathan Mostow replacing James Cameron atthe helm using John Brancato and Michael Ferris's script , welearn that Judgment Day, the end of humanity which shouldhave come (via ""T2"") about from Skynet's self-aware and angrymachines, did not happen. Still John Connor (Nick Stahl), is notat all paranoid when he opts to disappear, to give up everythingincluding his Mastercharge card, his gig, his residence, and(horrors) his cell phone, and roam the state. As he fears, aferocious cyborg comes out of the future to destroy him andtwenty-one others, people who are predicted to savehumankind albeit, perhaps, after the destruction of the earth. Not long after the stunning appearance of the gorgeous, athleticT-X (Kristanna Loken, taking a break from her New Yorkmodeling job) and her determined, emotionless killing of awoman (for her clothes and car) and a policeman (for a gunwhich, given her built-in weapons she hardly needs), theobsolete T-1000 model appears (Arnold Schwarzenegger), toact as bodyguard to Connor and a terminally frightenedveterinarian sought by T-X, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). Unless you're new to the way movie special effects can causeentire civilizations to break down, you're likely to appreciate theopening scenes best, when the action is more identifiable on ahuman level. The wittiest segment, then, involves TheTerminator's being reborn in Beverly Hills in his birthday suit. Terminator, who at first acts seems like the bad guy, simplydoes not know the ways of civilized Californians. He stridesnaked into a strip joint on Ladies Night to the wild applause ofthe young women gathered, violently ordering the currentdancer to remove all his clothes, as though he had just tasted ofthe tree of knowledge and requires some covering (again to theecstasy of the applauding, screaming crowd). From there, things don't exactly go downhill, but the story, trueto its theme of machine vs. machine, becomes moremechanical. Still, to its credit, the movie offers one of the mostdestructive car chases in recent memory, the employment of a100-ton crane that wreaks more havoc through L.A. than theCrips and the Bloods together, and the outright destruction ofbuildings, telephone poles, and utter devastation leaves thehavoc of the zombies in Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" in thedust. In the role of the rootless John Connor, Nick Stahl has littlechemistry with Claire Danes' Kate Brewster, but a hookupbetween the two had not been expected by either, nor could thelatter have an inkling that she would be instrumental inultimately saving humanity. Kristanna Loken steals the movieeven from Arnold, and feminists can rejoice in the ultimateempowerment of women as the ultra-feminine T-X beats thestuffings out of Mr. Universe. For those who, unlike me, preferthe human dimensions shown in the movie's initial half hour,we're assured that CGI has improved so much in just the lastcouple of years that neither T1 nor T2 could have employed thetechnology.",Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,R,2003,3

THEODORE REX, 1995 science fiction thriller written and directed by Jonathan R. Betuel belongs to the last category.  The plot is set in near future, in which genetic science has progressed to the point in which it is possible not only to resurrect dinosaurs but to genetically manipulate them into sentient beings and respected members of the community. One of those respected members of community is Teddy Rex (voice by George Newbern), young Tyrannosaurus Rex who had got the job within Grid City police department. However his tasks are mainly clerical and he dreams about doing real detective work. When another genetically altered dinosaur gets killed he is going to investigate it, partnered with Katie Coltrane (played by Whoopi Goldberg), veteran street cop not particularly happy for being paired with a partner that weighs a tone.  It isn't hard to imagine that the idea for THEODORE REX came after the success of JURASSIC PARK and the subsequent craze for all things related to dinosaurs. However, it is hard to imagine that someone in Hollywood had taken the idea of a movie featuring talking half-humanoid dinosaurs seriously. Perhaps nobody actually did and everyone hoped that the result of their efforts would be silly but entertaining comedy. Unfortunately, humour was something that Betuel's script missed and the result is a film too serious and complicated for little children (for whom it was obviously intended) and in the same time too silly for the adult audience. In terms of sheer badness, THEODORE REX doesn't represent the worst possible atrocity - someone had obviously spent a great deal of budget on futuristic sets and occasional special effect or two. Unfortunately, little creative energy was spent on everything else. Whoopi Goldberg was reportedly aware of this fact and tried to leave production that could have ruined her reputation, but the contract obligation has prevented her from doing so. Fortunately, the viewers are not bound to THEODORE REX and this is the freedom they should use. ",Theodore Rex,PG,1996,1
864," There's something about the Farrelly brothers: in this age of politicalcorrectness, the writing/directing duo of Bobby and Peter is not afraid tothrow caution and, above all else, good taste to the wind in pursuit of agood laugh.  While their go-for-broke style certainly offends as many, ifnot more, people than it entertains, anyone who can tap into their trulysick and twisted wavelength will find a mother lode of laughs in theirlatest effort, the often disgusting, constantly shocking, but alwayshilarious _There's_Something_About_Mary_.  If the Farrellys pushed the envelope of decency with their previouslowbrow outings, the PG-13 rated _Dumb_and_Dumber_ and _Kingpin_, then theytear it to shreds in the R-rated _Mary_.  The film's poster features arather innocent, almost ironic-sounding disclaimer (""Warning: the guys whodid _Dumb_and_Dumber_ and _Kingpin_ bring you a love story""), but it is awarning worth heeding.  Plotwise, _Mary_ does fits the bill of atraditional romantic comedy.  Thirteen years after graduation, RhodeIsland-based loser Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller), still pines for hisglamorous high school love, Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz), with whom he wassupposed to go to the senior prom; needless to say, things did not quitework out.  Determined to have another chance at her, Ted hires sleazyinsurance claims investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down inher new home city of Miami--and that he does, only to pursue Mary, now animprobably glam orthopedic surgeon, for himself.  Sounds like typical romantic fluff, but it is far from it.  Remember thatwarning?  While the plot covers bases seen in other, tamer romanticcomedies, the brand of humor that is explored along the way is of thelowest brow.  If the diarrhea and bull semen gags in _Dumb_ and _Kingpin_,respectively, can be considered ""toilet humor,"" than what the Farrellysdelve into in _Mary_ is the waste product itself; ""gross-out"" humor seemstoo mild a term.  A number of bodily functions (exactly which and how, Iwill leave as a surprise) provide the basis of some big laughs, as do gagsinvolving drugged dogs, gay sex, and, yes, the physically and mentallychallenged.  If this sounds offensive to you, it is.  But its that giddy,vulgar sense of abandon, doing unspeakable things just extreme enough thatit cannot be taken seriously, that makes the brothers such a unique voicein comedy.  And one of the most refreshing.  As with all comedies, some gags clank.  A Greek chorus-like singer(Jonathan Richman), who, along with an accompanying drummer, appearssporadically to comment on the action, grows old after the first two""spontaneous"" appearances (though he is given a satisfying sendoff); and asight gag revolving around Ted's best friend Dom's (Chris Elliott)sensitive skin condition is not so much funny as just unpleasant to lookat.  But the Farrellys' hit-to-miss ratio is well over .500, reboundingfrom duds with some unbelievable showstoppers (such as an outrageous sightgag that will make all men cringe and cross their legs) and an able castthat must be commended for, above all else, their incredible bravery to dosome of the things they are called on to do.  It is hard to predict what exactly will be the box office fate of_There's_Something_About_Mary_; for each person that ""gets"" the Farrellybrothers' demented sense of humor, there is sure to be at least two thatare completely, totally disgusted.  But for me and the others on theirwarped vibe, _Mary_ is bad, dirty fun. ",There's Something about Mary,R,1998,2.5
865,"For anyone unfamiliar with the very real sleep disorder, Night Terrors,it can be defined as nightmares that occur in deep, non-REM sleep,in which the sufferer is overcome with extreme feelings of fear. Duringa night terror, which may last anywhere from five to twenty minutes,the person is still asleep, although the sleeper's eyes may be open.My reason for offering up an explanation for Night Terrors is twofold:(1) I have personally experienced them in the past, and (2) ""They,""directed by Robert Harmon, is an unsettling horror film that doesan applause-worthy job of showing just how truly terrifying NightTerrors are to experience. Harmon and screenwriter Brendan WilliamHood could definitely use a crash course in how to develop strongcharacters and stories, but from a visceral standpoint the film powerfullyburrows its way underneath your skin. Julia Lund (Laura Regan) is a graduate student working against a deadlineto complete her Psychology thesis. Her stress level raises significantlywhen she witnesses longtime friend Billy (Jon Abrahams) commit suicideafter he erratically warns her that the night terrors they sufferedfrom as children have come back to get them for good. Julia is understandablyskeptical at first, but when she and two acquaintances, Sam (EthanEmbry) and Terry (Dagmara Dominczyk), start re-experiencing the violentand horrifying night terrors that plagued them years ago, and seemto be linked by a similar wound on their bodies, their fear for their lives grows. If a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb, then""They"" works spectacularly well. Director Robert Harmon deftly understandsthat the scariest things are often those that are mostly unseen, lurkingjust out of frame or in the moodily lit shadows. The monstrous imageshe creates, with the aid of some surprisingly plausible special effectsand Ren_ Ohashi's atmospheric cinematography, are some of the eeriestto find their way to the screen this year. A climactic sequence seton a deserted subway is a near-masterpiece of genuine terror thatmay also make you jump out of your seat (it did me). Where ""They"" loses some of its momentum is in the exposition scenes.Save for protagonist Julia, played with an undeniable freshness byLaura Regan (2001's ""Someone Like You""), the rest of the charactersare sorely one-dimensional, and the relationships that form betweenthem are slight, at best. As fellow night terror victims, Ethan Embry(2002's ""Sweet Home Alabama"") and Dagmara Dominczyk (2002's ""The Countof Monte Cristo"") are quite good--too good to be stuck in such unrewardingroles. Marc Blucas (2002's ""We Were Soldiers"") rounds out the maincast, steadfastly playing Julia's devoted boyfriend, Paul, who haslittle more to do than stand around and try to comfort the unhinged Julia. The staple horror movie formula of having a character going off aloneand being terrorized in dark, lonely places in between every sceneof dialogue is also too often relied upon, creating a predictablerepetitiveness. What lessens the blow, however, are some actual goodscares. ""They"" could have been better on a number of levels, but itis, nonetheless, a shiver-inducing, nerve-rattling ride, with a shockinglygrim final scene that may offer up as valid a reason as any for keepingthe lights on at bedtime.",They,PG-13,2002,1.5
866,"""The Thief of Baghdad"" was an elaborate technicolorremake of the 1924 silent classic.  ProducerAlexander Korda struggled mightily to make thefilm, going through six directors, and he wasforced by the war to move the final productionfrom North Africa to the U.S.  The expensesassociated with the enormous sets and the earlycolor cinematography made ""The Thief of Baghdad""one of the most expensive films ever made to thatpoint, costing more than ""Gone With the Wind"".  The story is greatly changed from the 1924 version.Douglas Fairbanks' character is split into two roles,a love interest (Ahmad, played by John Justin) andan adolescent thief (Abu, played by Sabu).  Ahmad isthe puppet prince of evil magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt).Jaffar conspires to kill Ahmad, who is saved bythe ever-resourceful Abu.  Ahmad soon falls fora foreign princess (June Duprez), who is the daughterof a foolish, toy-obsessed king (Morton Selten, whois also credited as one of the writers).  Jaffaralso wants the lovely princess, who in turn pinesfor Ahmad.  Ahmad and Abu spend the rest of thefilm trying to pry the princess from the clutchesof evil Jaffar, frequently performing brave andheroic deeds in the process.  These deeds are aidedby a bombastic genie (Rex Ingram), an all-seeing eye,a magic bow, and a flying carpet.  Many of thesestory elements later found their way into Disney's""Aladdin"" (1992) animated feature.  ""The Thief of Baghdad"" was nominated for fourAcademy Awards, including Best Color Cinematography(George Perinal), best sets (Vincent Korda, theproducer's brother), Best Special Effects (LawrenceButler), and Best Original Score (Miklos Rozsa).  ""The Thief of Baghdad"" is highly regarded today.No amount of web-surfing could come up with anegative comment about the film.  But my experiencewith the film was different.  I found the soundtrackblaring, the special effects cheezy, and the entirestory was implausible (admittedly from an adult'spoint of view).  I am aware that the film is a fantasy,but then there is the instant, mutual love thatAhmad and the princess have.  There is also theobsession that Abu has for Ahmad, and that Jaffarhas for the princess.  I can accept that there isan all-seeing eye, but not that flinging it againstrocks will send you to a sky palace where elderlysultans will greet you as a hero.  I can acceptthat enormous genies can be trapped inside a bottle,but not that they are so stupid as to go back inside.I can accept that Abu must kill a giant spider tosteal the all-seeing eye, but the eye's 'guardians'seem thoroughly confused.  And, personally, if an evil magician made me blindor turned me into a dog, I wouldn't mess with himanymore.

Imagine takingauthority over a whole state when, if invited into the Valley homeof Melanie (Holly Hunter) and her 13-year-old daughter Tracy(Evan Rachel Wood), he'd go out of his mind in a matter ofhours trying to govern just one teenager!  A stronger personthan Arnold is needed for this awesome feat, and the girl'smother simply is not that person.     In her directing and screenwriting debut, Catherine Hardwickeworked with the film's co-star, Nikki Reed, who co-write thescript based on her own experience as a thirteen year old.  Thistime, though, Reed performs in the role of Evie, the adolescentwho helped lead Tracy down the path of righteousness into ahell of sex, drugs, and rap.       As Evie, Nikki Reed has no problem gaining influence overher disciple given the absence of strong supervision by hercaring, but confused mother who is too busy going to AAmeetings and cavorting with her formerly addicted boy friend(Jeremy Sisto), who is just out of rehab.  For his part, theboyfriend can scarcely fill the shoes of Melanie's ex-husband,who is too busy running a business to give proper attention tohis daughter or even take advantage of visitation rights.     ""Thirteen"" is a no-holds-barred film that may have beeninspired by Larry Clark's even more ferocious 1995 film""Kids,"" likewise a cinema verite-style depiction of teens on theloose, hedonistic and devoid of proper parental supervision.Clark, however, is so graphic that he's been appropriatelyaccused of exploitation.  By contrast, ""Thirteen"" looks every bitbelievable.     Everybody knows that adolescents, for all their energy, aregoing through a difficult time experiencing lows as frequently asthey are ecstatic.  What's remarkable here is how suddenlyTracy undergoes a transformation from being a good, seventh-grade student able to write poetry but shunned by the hot crowdin her junior high to a hottie herself, a girl who befriends Evie,the hottest (and therefore the coolest) student in the school. Influenced in part by the plethora of sexy billboard ads forperfume, underwear and the like pushing the idea that the rightclothes can bring you the American Dream, Tracy is furtherinduced to belong to the smart set in her school when she joinsEvie on a shopping spree, shucking her girl-next-door threadsfor navel-exposing tights with money gained from purse-snatching and goods from shoplifting.   Convinced by Evie thathomework should center on how to kiss and then some, Tracytakes up with some of the fast guys in the school, smokes,scores coke, ignores schoolwork, curses her frazzled mom, andindulges paradoxically in masochistic behavior, making incisionsin her arm with a pair of scissors.   She gets her tongue andnavel pierced and ringed, acting out from a desire to get back ather ineffective mother as much as to be with the fast kids inseventh grade.     We didn't need ""Thirteen"" to wake us up to the dysfunctionalfamily trend.

But director CatherineHardwicke never portrays Tracy as a lost cause.  Wesympathize with her, a young innocent being brought down by amore sophisticated albeit malevolent mentor, and want tobelieve that once Evie gets out of her life, she will do an about-face.  Cinematically, though, the 16mm camera should break itsamphetamine habit.

869,"During the Cuban missile crisis, John F. Kennedy faced a real-lifeArmageddon as the world came as close as it ever has to global nuclear war.THIRTEEN DAYS, starring and produced by Kevin Costner, depicts this famousperiod.  As a history lesson, it is absolutely engrossing, but, as a movie,it falls short of what it should have been able to achieve.  Although thefilm is well worth seeing and clearly gets a hit, with this material itshould have gotten a home run. Directed by Roger Donaldson, whose dubious credentials include his mostrecent films, DANTE'S PEAK and SPECIES, and scripted by David Self, whoseonly credit is the laughably bad THE HAUNTING, THIRTEEN DAYS is perhaps asgood as could be expected.   With a gratingly exaggerated accent, Costner, playing Kennedy's specialassistant and personal friend, Kenny O'Donnell, manages to upstage his bossin most of their scenes.   Bruce Greenwood plays John Kennedy as a brooding,withdrawn type whose real genius was to pick the best advice fromconflicting advisors.  Greenwood's bland performance is emblematic of whatis wrong with the movie, namely that it gets itself bogged down in long,slowly paced interior scenes in which the strategy is planned.  But when themovie cuts back and forth between the politics on the ground and theexcitement of the ships at sea and the planes in the air, the film reallycomes alive. The story happens in October of 1962.  In the midst of the mid-term electionin the United States, a U2 spy plane, high over Cuba, takes a picture ofRussian missiles, not yet armed, being put into place.  Pointed at theUnited States, these missiles could reach almost as far as Seattle and couldkill most American citizens within minutes.  This would give the Russians afirst-strike capability and forever upset the world's balance of power. We had to force the Russians to back down, but how?  Gen. Maxwell Taylor(Bill Smitrovich), Gen. Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway) and the rest of themilitary brass counsel the president to strike before the missiles areoperational and be prepared to wage nuclear war when, and if, the Russiansretaliate.  LeMay, for one, figures that the Russians will not strike backbecause they will be afraid of starting a nuclear holocaust.   Kenny O'Donnell and Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp), on the other hand, believethat a more peaceful solution must exist.  With much difficulty, RobertKennedy forces the Pentagon to reveal the blockade strategy which they hadbeen holding back.  This is the approach that the president, after muchagonizing, finally adopts.  It is only partially successful.  As we nowknow, the blockade, combined with some skillful negotiation and somefortuitous incidents, eventually caused the Russians to dismantle theirmissiles. Trevor Jones's music for the picture is the old-fashioned melodramatic type.The big black limos used by the government officials are mainly 1959Cadillacs, probably because they featured the biggest and most ridiculoustailfins ever.  But the acting is generally too reserved.  When the directorallows emotions to come to the surface, the movie has the impact that itshould.

Loosely based on Daniel Galouye's'60s sci-fi novel ""Simulacron 3,"" the idea revolves around a computerthat enables its user to time-travel. Only a story never develops fromthe original concept of juxtaposing sepia-toned Los Angeles in 1937with the full-color reality of the present time. Blame it on directorJosef Rusnak's and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez' underwritten screenplay,riddled with wooden dialogue.  Computer visionary Armin Mueller-Stahlis the first to download time-travel but he runs into foul play, whichbrings his over-wrought assistant, Craig Bierko, to the rescue. Then,when more trouble ensues, technie Vincent D'Onofrio goes back in timetoo. All three encounter lovely femme fatale Gretchen Mol, who istrying to pass herself off as Mueller-Stahl's daughter. Or is she acheck-out girl at a local grocery store? That's a question botheringDennis Haysbert, a detective. The visually stylish, art decoatmosphere in the somber, cavernous simulated world is appealing butit's not enough to sustain interest as the plot evaporates.  CraigBierko seems like a poor man's Alex Baldwin, complete with a two-daybeard growth, while Gretchen Mol works hard at evoking Marilyn Monroebut she's weak.

871,"      THREE WISHES is a totally non-offensive family movie about nothingmuch of anything, but one that provides a pleasant, dreamy time at thelocal Bijou.  No one attempts anything remotely resembling acting, buta series of nostalgic images feel your senses as you are transported toa simpler time.  You get to be a nine year old boy in 1955 exactly as Ionce was.  The great lovely and lush cinematography (Johnny E. Jensen)is full of the saturated colors of the movies of that era.  The setsare perfect and full of 50's kitsch.  I think the sets are awardcaliber.       Although the movie starts and ends in the present, it is setalmost totally in the summer of 1955.  The mother, Jeanne Hallman (MaryElizabeth Mastrantonio), and her two sons, nine year old Tom (JosephMazzello) and three year old Gunther (Seth Mumy) live in a new tracthousing development in California.  The development is set in themiddle of a desert, but the homes all have grass lawns and little scrubtrees.  Behind the houses are cactuses and barren land.  As they driveup to the development, we see the large billboard proudly proclaimingthese as ""The American Dream Homes"" and listing the price as $13,500.Most viewers will remark what a steal that seems.  Since we moved atthat time to a similar development in Texas and paid $8,000, myreaction was that California was overpriced even 40 years ago.       The family is trying to find its way since the father was a pilotwho was shot down, killed, and lost forever over Korea three yearsearlier.  Some of the early scenes are of the Hallman family going tovisit the military graveyard where the father is not buried.  The mommakes do with accounting jobs she does not want and for which is notparticularly well suited.  The Hallman's go to a town picnic where Jeanne is told she is ""daring""for wearing shorts.  Tom is humiliated by being the only one not pickedfor the baseball game since, as one of the kids told himmatter-of-factly, ""we want to win.""  Again, this hits home, because Iwas a terrible baseball player and was always picked last if at all.       Jeanne hits a drifter, Jack McCloud (Patrick Swayze), with hercar.  Since she broke his leg, she takes pity on him and invites him tostay at their home.  As the story unfolds, it seems that he may have asecret and he may know magic or then again, maybe not.  What is certainis that he has a Zen approach to teaching baseball and the local littleleague team, which is in the cellar, can use all of the help it canget.       The best part of the show has nothing to do with the flimsy plot.The best part is the sets.  We have the 50s lovingly recreated inturquoise which has to be the color of that era.  We have turquoisedial phones, refrigerators, china sets, etc.  It feels as ifeverything, but Jeannie's hair is turquoise.  It is presented much asthe GE Carousel of Progress did at Disneyland for years until, sadly,they tore it down.  The only part of the movie that is inauthentic isthe fascination with bomb shelters and the fear of bomb blasts, whichis always over emphasized in movies about the 50s.  Of course, Jeannedrives a Woody, but the other cars are neat too with salmon and whitetwo tone Fords and other classic cars.  Little Gunther even has hisDavy Crockett coonskin cap.       Back to the lack of acting.  Heartthrob Patrick Swayze has neverbeen much of an actor.  He was fine in DIRTY DANCING, but has donenothing else worth mentioning.  Here he spends the entire movie with asingle pensive stare and rarely speaks.  Practice a pensive look in themirror for an hour, and you could do as well.  Now go to centralcasting and get your million.       Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has had a few decent pictures, thelast being CONSENTING ADULTS, but I have never been particularlyimpressed by her work.  Here she perfects a pleasant little smile andkeeps it unchanged throughout the entire movie.  I think she must haveused Crazy Glue.       Joseph Mazzello does not show a lot of promise, but he wassuperior to any of the adults.  Only first time movie actor Seth Mumydoes a credible job.  His dream scene is full of imaginative acting.The real hero of the show is a fuzz ball of a dog that Jack owns.  Heis a delight to watch especially in the scene where he mimics Gunther'sfright while watching King Kong on TV.       The movie has heavy stereotyping.  The dads are all shown as onesthat you would not want for your dad.  They push their kids and do notreally care about them.  They mainly want to drink cocktails and waitfor hunting season so they can kill all the beautiful deer in the area.The moms are stay at home types who spend most of their time beingbusybodies.       The film moves slowly as is it is in a trance and yet, I wascaught up in it.  It is not a film to analyze heavily or its spiritwill vanish in front of you because of some Heisenberg uncertaintyprinciple.  It has an aura that is hard to capture in print, but thenagain, perhaps it is because I can identify with the era so well.  Witha better director (Martha Coolidge whose only decent film was RAMBLINGROSE) and a different cast, the film had potential for much more.       Oh yes, you probably want to know what all of this has to do withthree wishes.  Well, in the last ten minutes of the show, we get tothat almost as an afterthought.  Suffice it to say that it is the onlyattempt at seriousness and meaning in the entire film.  It is a partialsuccess.  The last scene, set in the present, is excellent and awonderful way to wrap up a show that had no direction.       THREE WISHES runs too slow at 1:48.  It is rated R for a onesecond glimpse at Swayze's nude rear, a few bad words, and two mildlyscary scenes.  Most kids over 4 should be able to handle it fine.  Thisis a show that will bore kids with short attention spans.  Jeffrey (age6 1/2) liked the show although he did not seem particularly enthusedabout it.  He gave it a thumbs up overall, but a thumbs sideways forthe brief monster dream sequence.  The monster turns out to be a goodguy in the dream I should point out.  I can not bring myself torecommend others see this show, but I actually enjoyed it, and I giveit **. ",Three Wishes,PG,1995,2
872,"There are two kinds of bad films, one better than the other. The recent""Catwoman"" places in the first category, of movies so misguided andgoofily terrible that they offer a certain kind of campy entertainmentvalue. ""Thunderbirds,"" based on a television action show that starredmarionettes, falls splat in the more lowly category, of movies somindnumbingly awful and creatively worthless that they are physicallypainful to sit through. 90 minutes may not seem like a long time,but ""Thunderbirds"" makes sure that it feels like a short lifetime. This summer's ""Spy Kids"" wannabe, ""Thunderbirds"" makes this past spring'sclone, ""Catch That Kid,"" look like a sophisticated, scholarly masterpiecein comparison. International Rescue is a top-secret organization ofadventurers who travel to the ends of the world on dangerous missions.The head of International Rescue is former astronaut and entrepreneurJeff Tracy (Bill Paxton), whose teenager son, Alan (Brady Corbet),feels left out of the exciting family business. When their headquarters,Tracy Island, is ambushed by master criminal The Hood (Ben Kingsley),whose long-winded plan involves stealing the organization's five technologicallyadvanced and engineered flying vehicles„known as Thunderbirds„andperforming a bank robbery in London, Alan and his two friends, Fermat(Soren Fulton) and Tintin (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), take it upon themselvesto put a stop to the evil plan and save Alan's family. And if he succeeds,maybe, just maybe, Alan will finally earn a place alongside his dadand brothers as a member of the Thunderbirds. As the minutes ever so slowly ticked by, the same thought kept enteringmy mind: ""Thunderbirds"" may have a bigger budget, but it is just aboutas close to one of those ultra-cheesy, ultra-bad Ed Wood-style sci-fipictures of the '50s and '60s as any modern movie ever has gottenoutside of direct homages (1998's ""I Woke Early the Day I Died,"" 2003's""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""). Directed by Jonathan Frakes (2002's""Clockstoppers""), it is never clear whether ""Thunderbirds"" is intentionallysilly to the point of parody or merely a complete catastrophe. Eitherway, the movie isn't funny, testing the viewer's threshold for tortureas it trots out a tacky animated opening credits sequence that playslike a discarded ""alternate opening"" DVD special feature; shudder-worthycornball dialogue that would only pass muster in Ed Wood's oeuvre;acting so wooden and half-hearted that the television-version marionetteswould likely have given more emotive performances; a long-winded premiseso decrepit and desperate it comes off feeling like ""Spy Kids 48;""and sporadic action, devoid of the ""intensity"" described in the MPAA's rating reason. Brady Corbet (2003's ""Thirteen"") tries to do what he can with hislead role as young Alan Tracy, but he is awash in a black hole, gettingno help from his co-stars or the Cliche Writers 101 Handbook (read:screenplay) by William Osborne (2002's ""The Scorpion King"") and MichaelMcCullers (2002's ""Austin Powers in Goldmember""). Vanessa Anne Hudgens(also from ""Thirteen"") is one of the most glaringly stilted childperformers in memory, as friend Tintin. Her dialogue is mercifullyminimal in an attempt to hide her inadequacies, but to no avail. Bill Paxton (2002's ""Frailty"") embarrasses himself as the overwroughtJeff Tracy, reciting some of the film's most frightening lines, usuallyabout the importance of family and the dues that must be paid beforeone can become a Thunderbird adventurer. As the maniacal The Hood,Ben Kingsley wears a lot of eye shadow in a role he must have beenbribed or brainwashed into taking, especially after his Oscar-nominatedturn in 2003's ""House of Sand and Fog."" Saving ""Thunderbirds"" froma dreaded ""no stars"" rating is Sophia Myles (2001's ""From Hell""),as the kind but uppity Lady Penelope. Myles is the only one who seemsto realize what a turkey she has gotten herself into, and answersthe call of duty by hamming it up with knowing sarcasm. In a betterfilm, Sophia Myles could b e a charmer. The final thirty minutes play like a never-ending nightmare that theviewer„both adults, who will be in misery, and children, who deservemore credit„cannot wake up from. As the action moves to London andthe chase to stop The Hood gets underway, the movie surpasses beinga sheer endurance test and transcends into twisted self-torture foranyone who has decided to sit it out to the closing credits. Everytime the story appears to be winding down, Jeff Tracy is quick tosay, ""Our mission isn't over quite yet."" By the time the end reallydoes come, you may find yourself experiencing a fantasy of findingall the copies of the picture and burning the negatives. ""Thunderbirds""is terminal family fare, sloppy, boring, dumbed-down and heinous.Each ticket stub sold should come with a guarantee of shriveling your brain cells. ",Thunderbirds,PG,2004,0.5
873,"For many scientific purists, concept of time travel is sopreposterous that they tend to bar time travel films andnovels from science fiction domain. According to them, timetravel books, comics and films should be branded fantasyinstead. That position might find its arguments in the waythat Hollywood usually treated time travel. Most of thetime, that concept was nothing more than a convenient excusefor exotic, but standard adventures and films without anyambitions of seriousness. But, every once in a while, therecomes a time travel film with brains. George Pal's classicadaptation of equally classic H.G. Wells' novel THE TIMEMACHINE is one of them. TIME AFTER TIME, 1979 film anddirectorial debut by Nicholas Meyer, is perfect companionpiece to it.  In George Pal's film, by naming the hero - Victorian timetraveller - ""George"", the authors hinted that the real heroof the novel might be H.G. Wells himself. Meyer, who hadalready played with mixing fiction with real historicalpersonalities in his novel SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION, goes evenfurther - the time traveller in his film is really H.G.Wells (played with Malcolm McDowell). Same as his ""George""incarnation, he invites his friends in London 1893 topresent them his new innovation - the time machine. Thepresentation is, however, interrupted when Scotland Yardarrives. It turns out that one of the guests, Doctor JohnLeslie Stevenson (played by David Warner) happens to be Jackthe Ripper. While Wells and his friends struggle withshocking revelation, Stevenson uses the confusion and, outof desperation, decides to test this new machine. ExaminingStevenson's mysterious disappearance, Wells concludes thatthe killer managed to travel to year 1979. Feelingresponsible for allowing bloodthirsty maniac to roam infuture Utopia, Wells goes to future too in order to bringhim to justice. His travel brings him to San Francisco 1979,strange new megalopolis that at first sight looks like anutopian society. But, soon he discovers that the Utopia hasits bad side, and, most of all, his quest for Stevenson isfailing. Things change when he meets Amy Robbins (MarySteenburgen), bank teller and liberated woman, who decidesto help him in his quest, mostly because she fancies bizarrebut charming Englishman.  Although it is actually not based on H.G. Wells' novel, thisfilm is closer to its spirit than 1960 version. When hewrote the novel, Wells was less interested in purescientific speculations; instead, he saw science fiction asa way to talk about burning social issues of his time, aswell as to offer some solutions. This film presents us Wellsas a man before his time, socialist reformer who fought forfree love, feminism, racial equality, people's rights, andmany other things we now take for granted. Meyer uses timetravel to confront Wells' ideals with reality - when hearrives in San Francisco during the zenith of ultra-liberal,hedonistic era of sexual revolution and counter-culture, hediscovers that many of his ideals are reality. But, on theother hand, human nature hadn't improved and, all thoseideals are paired with world wars, nuclear weapons,pollution, terrorism and other horrors Wells couldn't haveimagined. While poor idealistic reformer has trouble fittinginto this fascinating, but in the same time frighteningworld. On the other hand, bloodthirsty yet cynical andpractical Stevenson makes 1979 his home without anydifficulty.  Clever commentary is the reason enough to fend off all thecritics of this film, who had considered TIME AFTER TIME tobe nothing more than light- hearted fantasy. Their argument,of course, is valid only the movie is entertaining indeed -conflict between Victorian gentleman and the modernenvironment provided excellent opportunity for many subtleyet effective jokes. The humour in this film is reallycharming, and it is helped by Malcolm McDowell who uses thisfilm as rare opportunity not just to play a good guy for achange, but also to express his comedic talents. His partnerMary Steenburgen shows her comedic talent too, and also thegreat skill that helps her in the transformation betweenstrong modern liberated woman and classic damsel indistress. The romantic chemistry between the two is great,and it shouldn't surprise anyone that they transcended theirpartnership into real life.  Unfortunately, David Warner didn't feel particularlyinspired in the role of Jack the Ripper. He lacks thecharisma of pure evil that is necessary ingredient for anyeffective villain that this film required. Flaw in thecharacterisation is just one of the many of this film -cheesy and totally unconvincing special effects, scientificplot holes and implausibilities, some rather uninspiredlines - that culminate in rather disappointing and ultra-conventional finale. The musical score of Hollywood veteranMiklos Rozsa, on the other hand, might have lookedanachronistic in any other film of the period, but it wasright on the target in this story. But, all in all, TIMEAFTER TIME is more than good piece of science fictioncinema, that could outrank not only some of the time travelatrocities of its own time (FINAL COUNTDOWN comes to mind),but also some of the future films with much more fame(TERMINATOR, BACK TO THE FUTURE).  (Special note to x-philes: Charles Cioffi, who playedskeptical FBI official in the pilot episode of the X-FILESappears in this film with similar role of skeptical SanFrancisco police inspector.) ",Time After Time,PG,1979,3
874,"Heck, anyone can go a few decades into the future like JamesMangold's Leopold Mountbatten or some years into the past likeGregory Hoblit's John Sullivan.  But try moving forwardsome 800,000 years!  You probably think you won't needsunscreen when you arrive, but when Alexander Hartdegen(Guy Pearce)  in Simon Wells's adaptation of H.G. Wells'masterpiece, ""The Time Machine,"" steps out of his eponymouscontraption, he sees what at first looks like a prelapsariancivilization with an Eve-like woman, Mara (Samantha Mumba)and her little brother, Kalen (Omero Mumba). So far as weknow, Wells himself never used a time machine so he could nothave known about the Enron scandal when he wrote his slimnovel in 1894, but in composing his tract he was determined toshow his reservations about capitalism in England.  Just as thedanger of nuclear extinction was the big worry during the 1960swhen school children were told to protect themselves bycrawling under their desks, the dangers of class warfare werethe big concern of thinkers like Wells in England.   Alas: Simon Wells, the great-grandsome of H.G., doesn't carea whit about economics or politics in his version of the book,originally adapted to the screen in 1960 by George Pal (andlater remade for TV in 1978).  Wells appears intent onconveying an imaginative story, one which would stimulate ourbrain waves in the year 2002, perhaps to think, ""If I had achance to take a trip in a time machine, would I accept thechallenge and, if so, would I go into the past or the future?  Howmany years?  (Would you?)    If anyone in the audience perceives this version of ""The TimeMachine"" to be a statement about anything at all, he or sheprobably read the novel or the Cliff Notes because, sad to say,the film is lacking in both resonance and interest.  In fact it'spretty dull going something like a current traveler's wanting togo on a three weeks' vacation in Paris but winding up somehowin Passaic, New Jersey instead.  The ""Kate & Leopold"" openingshows nerdy physics professor Alexander Hartdegen wrappedup in a problem on his chalkboard back in the New York (notLondon) of 1896, reminded by a colleague, Dr. Philby (MarkAddy), that he has a hot date with his fianc,-to-be, Emma(Sienna Guillory).  When tragedy strikes his lady fair that night,he is determined like ""Frequency""'s Jim Caviezel to get intouch with the past and thereby undo the disaster.  Getting intohis time machine, which took him four years to build, he returnsto that night and, realizing that retreating to the past is futile(though this point is not credibly made), he believes thattraveling a few years into the future could solve the problem. He hits his head, the machine goes nuts, and in moments he'sin the year 802,000 and some change.  He likes what he sees,especially the lovely Mara (Dublin pop singer/songwriterSamantha Mumba), but is annoyed when some giant, moronicMorlocks threaten to devour everyone in sight.  His job now is tosave the new love of his life, and to destroy the uber-Morlockwho controls the beasts (Jeremy Irons). While the 1960 version of the story won an Oscar for specialeffects, we're now past the age of wonder, are drenched inmovie technology, and see nothing here to capture theimagination in that regard. The most that can be said is thatWells restrains himself so that the machine and the civilizationof 800,000 + is almost believable.  Especially neat isHartdegen's slow climb into the year 2030 as building in NewYork quickly rise instead of falling, but once the Morlocks go onthe attack with their chimpanzee-like springing and theirfearsome growls, we're tripping in ho-hum territory.   H.G. Wells meant the Morlocks to represent the lower classesin England as they had evolved, regressively, many milleniahence.  Taking umbrage at being kept down by the sun-drenched Eloi, they take revenge on their class masters in afuturistic version of Jean-Pierre Denis's ""Murderous Maids"" orJean Genet's ""The Maids.""  No such import here.  While thecivilization encountered by Hartdegen at first looks like the idyllicone the embraced the conclusion of Francois Truffaut's""Fahrenheit 451,"" there is nothing that compares to Truffaut'stheme of a society trying to save itself by restoring the now-banned printed page.  While Mara, in fact, resembles the malefantasy embraced by Bryan Forbes's ""Stepford Wives,"" there isno feminist import either.  And while the Morlocks are trying togobble up everyone over the age of thirty, this is not MichaelAnderson's  ""Logan's Run"" there is no warning to us in theaudience of the dangers of a society that has no use for anyonebut the young.  In other words, a sci-fi film without politicalresonance and without some form of original eye candy or wide-eyed adventure is rough traveling indeed.","Time Machine, The",PG-13,2002,2.5
875,"For many people with the scientific background, concept oftime travel seems more suitable to fantasy than to sciencefiction genre. It seems that Hollywood filmmakers share thatopinion, because almost always the films dealing with timetravel usually don't bother with such boring problems liketime travellers killing their own parents before their ownconception etc. Sometimes those films touch such problems,but the time travel is more often than not just a backgroundfor standard adventure or mindless action. TIMECOP, 1994action film directed by Peter Hyams, falls within thatsecond category.  Based on the Dark Horse comic books, screenplay by MikeRichardson and Mark Verheiden demands that the viewersuspends a lot of disbelief. In 1994, time travel isdiscovered and U.S. government sets up TEC - elite secretunit of superagents, whose only job is to prevent the peoplefrom abusing the technology and changing past for their ownpurposes. After his loving wife Melissa (Mia Sara) dies,Washington D.C. policeman Max Walker (Jean-Claude Van Damme)would join that force. Ten years later, Max Walker discoversthat powerful and greedy Senator McComb (Ron Silver) alreadysends his henchmen into the past to steal money in order tobring funds for his presidential campaign. Walker goes backto 1994 in order not only to prevent the conspiracy, butalso to save his own wife.  Apart from big plot holes involving time paradox, scientificgaffs (carbon dating of gold) or huge implausibilities,TIMECOP is a rather entertaining film. Peter Hyams, whodirected it, can make his way through SF material (startingwith his 1980 space opera OUTLAND), knows the limitation ofmaterial and does standard action routines, indulginghimself with few experiments with photography. Jean-ClaudeVan Damme as protagonist is quite tolerable, although hisacting talent is always comes second to his martial artsabilities. The real winner in that contest is Ron Silver ascorrupt senator, in role very similar to the one he hadplayed in LIVE WIRE. This time it is real fun watching him,especially in the scene when he meets younger version ofhimself. However, although TIMECOP has required amountaction scenes, few rather impressive shots, couple ofwell-choreographed fights and relatively good looks, it isstill mediocre piece of Hollywood cinema. Those who aren'teasily insulted with cliches and disregard for scientificfacts might still enjoy it, though. ",Timecop,R,1994,2
876,"""The Gospel of John"" and ""The Passion of Christ"" take usback  two thousand years, ""Master and Commander"" twohundred, ""The Missing,"" positively currrent events with just 118years.  Richard Donner's ""Timeline"" splits the difference,transporting us six hundred fifty years back into the MiddleAges.  Why all this interest in the past?  As one character in""Timeline"" states during the opening minutes, ""The past iswhere it's at.  The past tells us where we were and where we'regoing.""  Archeology trumps futurism.  Jeff Maguire and GeorgeNolfi adapt Michael Crichton's novel for the screen giving theaudience the impression that Crichton must have some Ludditegenes.  At the very least noting the casting of David Thewlis asphysicist Robert Doniger, a man with an eerie resemblance toBill Gates we might even get the impression that Crichton isanti-Gates or at least convinced that computer science andquantum physics do not hold the answers the way archeologydoes.     Crichton, like John Grisham, has made heaps more money inwriting than this graduate of Harvard Medical School could havemade in the profession he studied, even if he'd find someone topay his premiums for malpractice insurance.  With 100 millionsold copies under the belt, including such well-known fiction as""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Andromeda Strain,"" you'd trust that hisgenius would be evoked by the cinematic version of his multi-layered book, ""Timeline.""  Unfortunately, Richard Donner'sproject, exploiting a castle made from scratch with a set designin Quebec, may enjoy Caleb Deschanel's lush photography, butthe story, obviously scratching a good deal of the novel, is banaland the many action scenes  simply clutter up the big screenwith redundance.   Anyone hoping to get an insight into 14thcentury European history will find out nothing about the lives ofthe peasants, and considering that the marvelous Billy Connollyis given ample screen time, will be surprised at the completeabsence of humor and wit.     Paul Walker, perhaps the handsomest young actor thatHollywood currently offers, takes the principal role of ChrisJohnston, a fellow who has his heart set on the pretty KateEricson (Frances O'Connor) but whose love is unrequitedbecause Kate is into archeology and Chris simply has littleinterest in the past.  That's about to change, because Chris willdiscover that no course at N.Y.U. can match the experience ofbeing an active participant in the life of the Dordogne Valley inFrance during the month of April, 1357.       The experience begins when Chris's father, archeologyprofessor Johnston (Billy Connolly), takes a trip back in time in amachine constructed by Robert Doniger (David Thewlis) and hisstaff a gadget designed to transport three-dimensional objectslike faxes but which is now used to bear people through a wormhole into the distant past.  Now a captive at a time that theFrench and English are in the midst of a hundred years' war, hewrites a note asking for help to get back, which leads Chris,Kate, archeologist Andre Marek (Gerard Butler) and others tothe past with the warning that they have exactly six hours toeffect the rescue before they can click  gadgets on their necksto return.  When something goes wrong with the machine andthe visitors may be looking into an awfully short life span at theswords and arrows of English and French knights, love gets achance to blossom amid the chaos that has been Europe's fatefor millennia.     Credit must be given to the production team for shunning areliance on CGI and going with a real set for the actors to workwith.  Aside from the generic explosions, aided by a devicegiven by Prof. Johnston to his captors to blow up sections ofcastle walls, there is more confusion than clarity in theexposition of the story.  Are we supposed to root for the French,since it's their land being plundered?  For the English, becausetheir survival helped them centuries later to support PresidentBush's wars?

When I wasa youngster, we used to have these lovable little animals show up atour outdoor chapel at camp so as soon as I saw the little critter, myheart was already growing warm for TIN CUP.       Kevin Costner plays Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy.  His current position isthat of golf pro at the almost abandoned driving range.  Cheech Marinhas the part of Romeo Posar, his buddy, caddie, and roommate in theirdilapidated trailer on the grounds of the driving range.       One day, a beautiful woman, Dr. Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), dropsin to get golfing lessons to impress her boyfriend, David Simms (DonJohnson).  Simms is a famous professional golfer and a one-time rivalto McAvoy.  Now, McAvoy is a has been, or more accurately a never was.He acts like his brains have long since been fried with constant andmassive drinking.  In the carefully chosen costumes by Carol Oditz(GEORGIA and SMOOTH TALK), McAvoy is made to look like someone whoshops at an Goodwill Store in Hawaii.  Combine this with his slovenlyappearance, and he is easy to write off as hopeless.       In a break from her normal tough roles as in OUTBREAK and IN THELINE OF FIRE, Rene Russo plays a failed real estate agent turnedtherapist.  Griswold is a bit of an airhead and not particularly goodat anything she does.  Although Russo has second billing to Costner,she owns the show.  Costner is great, but scenes with both of them init are hers to command, not by dominance but subtly.       The intelligent and literate screen by John Norville and RonShelton is full great one liners and even better verbal ripostes.  Iregret to say that most of the time when the characters trade barbswith each other, the lines are littered with unprintable words so I cannot include them here.  I make a point of insuring that all of myreviews are G ratable.  The foul language is never offensive, isperfectly natural, and fits the characters like a glove.       In one of the clean lines, McAvoy first tells the doctor of hisfeelings: ""Dr. Griswold, I think I'm in love with you.  From the momentI saw you, I knew I was through with strippers and motorcycle chicks.""How's that for a come on line to a professional woman?       Later she talks to him about his inner child.  He gives her anasty smile and asks, ""does my inner child need a spanking?""  The wayshe gets turned on by him and yet holds the romance at bay is one ofthe more delicate and interesting parts of the story.       Unlike most comedies, this is one with a strong message.  It canbe summed up as ""go for it.""  As McAvoy more elegantly puts it, ""When adefining moment comes along, the moment defines you or you define themoment.""  For McAvoy, this bravado is more of a handicap than ablessing.  He has a history of losing because he wanted to try for theeagle when a par would have won the match.  Gosh, I can't believe Ijust said that bit of golfspeak.  This show is infectious.       There is a part of the message of the show that I did not carefor.  When preparing for the big match, Romeo has Tin Cup get roaringdrunk the night before so he can loosen up.  Moreover, golfers areshown as big drinkers.  Perhaps, this is all accurate, but I hope notand certainly this is not a message I would want to give to the youngadults in the audience.       If you enjoy shows full of beautiful people, TIN CUP will notdisappoint.  Russo is one of the most gorgeous actresses in the moviestoday.  She is certainly the prettiest one over forty.  Costner is cuteas can be, and Johnson looks like a Greek god albeit one with a littletoo much grease in his hair.       The ending is a complete surprise.  The dramatic music by WilliamRoss during the ending is reminiscent of Miklos Rozsa's music forchariot ride in BEN-HUR (1959).       The major failing of TIN CUP is that it is too long.  Comedieshave no business coming in at over two hours.  Editors Kimberly Ray andPaul Seydor left in lots of long and pointless scenes, particularly inthe first part of the film.  Tighter editing would have significantlyimproved the picture.  For example, the stripper character and all ofher scenes should be cut, and many scenes need shortening.  There is noneed for the film to drag so often.       TIN CUP runs too long at 2:13.  The film is rated R for briefnudity and lots of quite foul, but to this critic, inoffensivelanguage.  There is no violence and the film is upbeat and goodnatured.  It would be fine for any teenager.  For subteens, be awarethat the F word is used frequently albeit nicely.  I recommend thissweet comedy to you and award it ***. ",Tin Cup,R,1996,3
878," Julie Taymor, who received both critical and popular acclaimfor her Broadway version of Disney's The Lion King, makes her filmdebut with a curious adaptation of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, oneof the Bard's least successful plays. It's a graphic, grisly, gruesomeorgy of vengeance, revolving around Titus, a proud but aging Romangeneral, played by Anthony Hopkins, who returns home in triumphcirca. 400 A.D. after conquering the Goths to crown the new EmperorSaturninus (Alan Cumming). His prized gift to the new ruler is Tamora(Jessica Lange), Queen of the Goths, whom the depraved Saturninusimpetuously marries - after being scorned by Titus's only daughter(Laura Fraser). Along with her secret lover, a villainous Moor (HarryLennix), and her two punkster sons (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, MatthewRhys), the furious Tamara then schemes to wreak a crafty revenge onTitus and his family for the ritual death of her oldest son at Titus'hands. Cinematically, Taymor idiosyncratically links this historicalepic of political intrigue with the 20th century by incorporating acontemporary lad (Osheen Jones) playing with toy soldiers. Workingwith production designer Dante Ferretti, costumer Milena Canonero andcinematographer Luciano Tovoli, the inventive Taymor sets out adefiant, dizzying visual feast, crowned by a repulsive, cannibalisticbanquet that could have been created by Hannibal Lechter - and it'simpressively scored by Elliot Goldenthal. On the Granger Movie Gaugeof 1 to 10, Titus is a perversely stylistic, surreal 6. It's a bold,bizarre bloodbath, giving us only fleeting glimpses of the tragiccharacters who - in later Shakespearean plays - evolve into King Lear,Lady Macbeth, and Iago. ",Titus,NR,2000,2.5
879,"      TO DIE FOR is the movie that finally proves that Nicole Kidman canact.  She does the best rendition of an airhead that I can remember.No, she doesn't just act natural.  In this movie, loosely based on theoutlines of a true story, she clearly works hard at her craft.Although it sometimes get a bit tedious and monotonous, her performancenever gets contrived or corny.       The movie opens with scenes of a murdered husband, Larry Maretto(Matt Dillon), in his living room floor and his wife, Suzanne StoneMaretto (Nicole Kidman), being accused of the crime.  Many scenesfollow of both sets of parents being interviewed on an Oprah styletelevision talk show.  We then flash back to happier times when Larryand Suzanne are meeting each other and getting married.       Suzanne Stone is an aspiring young TV personality.  What kind ofpersonality is not important to her, only fame is.  As she puts it,""You aren't really anybody in America if you're not on TV.""  Althoughshe starts as a gofer in a cable TV station in a small town, heraspirations are as big as America.  She obsesses with being the nextConnie Chung or Jane Pauley both of whom she thinks she is superiorto.  Jane, she whispers to the audience, has ""a tiny weight problem youknow.""  By sheer force of will, Suzanne becomes the ""weather girl"" onthis cable TV channel whose entire staff only numbers three.       There are many natural moments in TO DIE FOR like when Larry isbowling with his sister Janice (Illeana Douglas) and looks over atSuzanne in an adjoining lane and declares that he is going to marryher.  The cinematography (Eric Alan) of about a third of the movie is adocumentary style of talking heads and with a handheld camera full ofnumerous pans and zooms.  In a continuing series, we have an excellentperformance by Janice in her ice-skates talking about Larry and abouthow much she hated Suzanne.  This is not hard to fathom since whenSuzanne first meets Larry's sister she tells Janice how much happierJanice will be if she gets some plastic surgery to make her skinperfect.  Suzanne then goes on to point out how Gorbachev wouldprobably still be in power if had had plastic surgery on hisbirthmark.       In an autobiographical monologue that runs through the whole show,Suzanne pontificates about life.  She is always upbeat and smiling, andshe explains that ""It's nice to live in a country where life, liberty,and other stuff, stand for something.""  This is from a woman who getsaway with the murder of her spouse in cold blood.  Coming so close tothe conclusion of the farcical Simpson circus, some viewers may findthis part tragic rather than comical.       The script by Buck Henry and Gus Van Sant Jr. and based on thenovel by Joyce Maynard is filled with scenes so hilarious that I hadalmost uncontrollable laughter.  That is the good news.  The bad isthat there are wastelands of dead time between the laughs.  The problemwith the non-funny parts is that the writers have not createdcharacters that you care about so that no matter how great Kidman'sacting is and no matter how hard you laughed ten minutes ago, you don'tcare if the characters get used, abused, or shot.  Dillon, for example,doesn't have much of a part, and he certainly does nothing memorablewith it.       The heart of the story is the murder and how Suzanne seduces threeteenagers to kill her husband.  The lead teenager, Russell (CaseyAffleck) is a cliche of a kid with an demonstrable IQ about the samenumber as his age.  In an attempt to become famous, Suzanne makes amovie of these three losers from the local high school.  The cablestation manager, Ed Grant (Wayne Knight), tells the cops ""She must haveshot hundreds of hours with these three dory kids who had a majorproblem reciting the days of the week.""       As a director, I find Gus Van Sant Jr.'s style too eclectic for mytaste.  This is not surprising since his last film was that major bomb,EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.  Nevertheless, I do like TO DIE FOR.Finally, I want to give a special mention to the costume designers(Else Curtis and Beatrix Aruna Paszter) and the make up artists.  Theydo a wonderful job of making Suzanne into an extremely made up woman invery brief miniskirts and yet they never go over the line and overdoit.  The pushed her look to the absolute limit, but never made her looksleazy.       TO DIE FOR runs 1:40, and I think the editors (Jeffrey Arsenaultand Curtiss Clayton) should have left a few more entire scenes on thecutting room floor so that the meantime to laugher was much smaller.The movie is rated R for sex, understated violence, some profanity, andabout one second of nudity from a far distance.  It is a soft R, and Iwould see no problem in teenagers seeing the show.  There werecertainly many in the audience where I was.  I give TO DIE FOR a thumbsup for Kidman's performance, for interesting docudrama stylecinematography, and for some huge laughs, and I award it ** 1/2. ",To Die For,R,1995,2.5
880,"It has been said that no motion picture based on a video game can be any good, because to watch a movie with live-action characters and surroundings isn't even remotely the same, or as satisfying, as directly interacting with their digital counterparts. With 1995's ""Mortal Kombat"" being the only feature film I can think of to break the video-game-to-movie curse, ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" drearily directed by Simon West (1997's ""Con Air""), has no such luck.  This latest potential summer blockbuster has a lot riding on it; not only could the movie catapult Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie (1999's ""Girl, Interrupted"") to superstar status, but it could be the first in a potential big-screen series. Never having played the video game, but with a brother who is a fan, he couldn't have summed it up better as we left the theater: ""Aside from a few of the action scenes, the rest of the movie is sleep-inducing."" Rarely has such a big-budget action movie been as utterly boring as ""Tomb Raider"" is.  Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a tomb raider (whatever that is) who lives in an 85-bedroom mansion, complete with a servant, an assistant (Noah Taylor), and a pet robot, passed down to her from her deceased father, Lord Croft (Jolie's real-life dad Jon Voight). Just as all nine planets are about to align (an occurrence, we learn, that only happens every 5,000 years), Lara stumbles upon a clock her beloved father hid in the house that holds half of the key to taking control of time. The other part--a Triangle of Light broken into two pieces--has been hidden on opposite sides of the earth, something that the evil Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) has set out to locate in time for the eclipse. With not much time remaining, Lara ventures off after Powell and his henchmen, determined to do her dear dad proud.  The convoluted plotting of ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but that wouldn't matter if the movie was at least absorbing and exciting. It isn't, however, so what we get is a slow-moving snoozer that features so much dull exposition it hardly has time for what the viewer has come for--action. At 98 minutes, the film feels as if it is well over two hours, with little of interest occurring at any point. In their attempt to explain who Lara Croft is for the uninitiated, screenwriters Patrick Massett and John Zinman spend far too much time setting things up, and even then, we still don't get a true idea of what makes Lara tick.  Angelina Jolie is physically perfect for the coveted role of Lara Croft, but as a person, she is nothing more than a blank slate. Jolie has been a terrific actress in the past, and even has an Oscar to prove it, but she isn't able to give us an idea of who her character is, or why we should even like or care about her. Aside from the fact that her father died and she is crafty with weapons and fighting, Lara is an uninteresting, underdeveloped presence, and the part gets no help from Jolie. Though no fault of the actress, one other problem with Lara is, funnily enough, her breasts. At almost no point throughout do they ever look remotely real, and for Jolie's body frame, they are humorously too large and stand directly out, rather than naturally slope downward. I mention this minor criticism because Jolie's fake breasts serve no purpose for either her character or the movie; they're merely exploitive.  ""Tomb Raider"" has two good scenes amidst the creative dead zone that surrounds them. One involves stone statues coming to life in a tomb, which Lara has to fight off, and the other is the climactic action sequence set in a snowy cave, which is appropriately taut and well-shot. They not only hint at the thrilling movie this could have been, but expose the other lifeless 75 minutes for what they truly are: a waste of time. ",Tomb Raider,PG-13,2001,1.5
881,"At this point in today's mainstream cinema, gross-out humor has become as prevalent as the appearance of Friday during each week. Last week's bid for yuks (as well as yucks) was ""Say It Isn't So,"" and this week, it's ""Tomcats,"" a raunchy-as-all-hell comedy written and directed by first-time filmmaker Gregory Poirier. Some of the material is very funny, to be sure, but much of it doesn't work because, like ""Say It Isn't So,"" the editing isn't sharp enough to do the jokes complete justice. It doesn't help that a complete 20-minute portion of the movie forgets the premise and is solely devoted to the setup and payoff of a joke so gross it makes ""Scary Movie"" look relatively tame in comparison. Another 10-minute section sets up a dominatrix sequence involving an elderly woman that also has nothing to do with the story. There is a fine line between a movie that just so happens to be crass, and one whose only purpose is to turn stomachs.  The ""plot"" goes something like this: a group of male friends make a pact to make annual monetary contributions to a pot that will go to the one who remains single the longest, without getting married. By the time they hit 27, the pot has hit a cool half-million dollars, and only two of them have yet to tie the knot--Michael (Jerry O'Connell) and Kyle (Jake Busey). When Michael goes in debt after a bit of failed gambling in Vegas, he tracks down Natalie (Shannon Elizabeth), the one woman Kyle has slept with in his life whom he had actual feelings for. Having lost her virginity to Kyle seven years before, only to be nastily spurned by him and left with only a roll of quarters to call a taxi, Natalie decides to help Michael out and give Kyle a taste of his own medicine. Their plan entails her managing to steal his heart (no easy feat for such a cold-hearted womanizer) and marrying him, only to quickly get it annulled and share half of the money Michael will receive. In the process, Michael begins to fall in love with Natalie himself.  Sharing certain similarities with 2000's despicable ""Whipped,"" ""Tomcats"" is a step above that picture, but shares the same downfall: none of the characters are likable people. Michael may be the protagonist, and therefore the nicest guy to be found, but his foregoing conclusion that all women are merely sex objects is awfully shallow and distasteful, particularly for a young man in his late-twenties. Michael is played by Jerry O'Connell (1999's ""Body Shots""), a bright-faced veteran actor best known for playing the chubby, scaredy-cat Vern in 1986's ""Stand by Me."" O'Connell runs with the part, and goes all out in embarrassing himself in certain scenes, but he can't overcome the fact that Michael isn't a particularly interesting or amiable individual.  If there is anyone to care about (and I use such a term loosely), it is Natalie, played with an undeniable sweetness by Shannon Elizabeth (2000's ""Scary Movie""). Natalie is a police officer who also happens to be an enormously beautiful woman. She is smart, strong-willed, and doesn't put up with being disrespected by anyone, so it comes off as somewhat of a contradiction that she would waste her time helping Michael out with something so childish. If Natalie is harmed by the confines of the dumb, if ambitiously disgusting, screenplay, it is solely thanks to Elizabeth that she remains an intelligent girl.  If the idea of watching a big, hospital-set chase scene for an enlarged, cancerous testicle that concludes in a cafeteria sounds potentially funny, then ""Tomcats"" may be worth a look. It most certainly can't be criticized for a lack of energy, and is entertaining to a point, but one has to wonder how low this crude genre can possibly go before it stops being innocently fun and just becomes an example of pointlessly offensive bad taste. ""Tomcats,"" more so than most of the other recent films of its ilk, treads dangerously close to becoming the latter. ",Tomcats,R,2001,2
882," MarÕa Ripoll's TORTILLA SOUP wastes no time in getting to the star of the show,the food.  In the opening credits, the father, like a Samurai, furiously slicesand dices the wonderfully colorful cuisine.    Inspired by Ang Lee's EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, the story has been moved to L.A. andthe ethnic cuisine switched to Mexican.  A chef, Martin Naranjo (HectorElizondo), who has lost his ability to taste and smell, lives with his threegrown daughters, school teacher Leticia (Elizabeth PeÐa), young executive Carmen(Jacqueline Obradors) and soon-to-be college student Maribel (Tamara Mello). The center of their life is the dinner table at which eating is regularlyinterrupted by one of them saying, ""I have an announcement.""  This inevitablysets off another sweet squabble.    The dialog is uniformly cute.  Typical is the interchange between Maribel andher father when she drops the bombshell that she's thinking of postponingcollege.  He asks politely but firmly why she is considering the change.  ""Iwant to find myself,"" she replies.  ""Well, you won't have to look far,"" he tellsher with a fatherly blend of sarcasm and concern.  When they're not feasting (their meals for four look like royal banquets fortwelve), the women bicker with each other.  They also love each other, and oneof the loveliest episodes has them in the kitchen, breaking dishes and singing. The casting of the four leads is terrific, and they're so close that you'd swearthat they were related in real life.  Every family should have such a lovingfoundation.    There's not much wrong with this carefully prepared confection.  Raquel Welch,as the father's new girlfriend, can't keep up with the others' acting abilities. A more substantial problem is Xavier P_rez Grobet's grainy cinematography.  Thesumptuous food deserves a better presentation.  But you'll forget the flaws. You'll leave happy and hungry.    TORTILLA SOUP runs a bit long at 1:40.

883,"One of the most popular concepts in 1990s science fiction isvirtual reality. Rapid development of computer technology ismost evident in more and more realistic special effects inHollywood movies and television. Future world wherecomputers would be able to fool other human senses doesn'trequire much imagination. In such world it would be veryhard, almost impossible for humans to distinguish real worldfrom those created in computer simulations. There were manynovels, comic books, movies and TV shows based on suchconcept, MATRIX being most successful of them. However, suchconcept isn't new; it used to be explored many decades agoin the works of Philip K. Dick, one of the most importantand influential science fiction writers of 20th Century.Dick in his stories and novels often wrote about differentrealities created with supertechnology of the future, andconsequent loss of the identity among human beings. Some ofthose fears found the way to manifest themselves intoextraordinary films. Dick was one of few giants of sciencefiction literature lucky enough to have not one, but twogreat science fiction films. First one is BLADE RUNNER, 1982cult classic, and another, that stood in its shadow for thepast ten years, is TOTAL RECALL, 1990 film directed by PaulVerhoeven.  Plot of the film is loosely based on Philip K. Dick's shortstory ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"". The year is2084 AD and Doug Quaid (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger)seems to have everything he needs in life - a good home,steady job of construction worker and beautiful wife Lori(played by Sharon Stone). However, his idyllic life istroubled by dreams he has each night; in those dreams he ison Mars, in company of beautiful and mysterious brunette.Because of such dreams, he wants to travel to Mars, but hecan't afford it. Such problems are usually solved by""Rekall"", company specialised for inserting false memoriesinto people's minds. Quaid goes there and orders two weeksof false memories about his being on Mars. Routine proceduregoes terribly wrong because somebody had already implantedfalse memories into his mind. Quaid is suddenly beingattacked by his friends, co-workers and even his wife; theyare all operatives of all-powerful Agency, whose topofficial Richter (played by Michael Ironside) spares noeffort to kill him. It seems that Quaid used to be secretagent of Vilos Kohaagen (played by Ronny Cox), ruthlessgovernor of Mars colony, and had his memory erased afterbetraying him for the sake of Mars freedom fighters. Quaidmust travel to Mars in order to solve the mystery of his ownidentity and find the girl of his dreams.  Filmmakers took great liberty with original story, but,luckily Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, experience writersof science fiction cinema classics, were members ofscript-writing team. As a result, TOTAL RECALL has anoriginal, exciting, intelligent and thought-provokingscript, one of the best produced in Hollywood in the lastfew decades. Most interesting aspect of the film is the ideathat the sufficient level of technology can erase anydifference between objective reality and subjectiveperception of the world. For most filmmakers today, the bestmechanism is virtual reality. For Dick in the story, andscreenwriters in this film, such mechanism was somewhat moreprimitive technique of implanting false memories. Suchtechnology, although crude, exists today (at least, if weare to believe reports about alleged alien abductees beingmanipulated into fabricating their stories under hypnosis),so it isn't hard to imagine its widespread use in the nexthundred years. Suspension of disbelief is even easier whenit comes to that technology being misused for some nefariouspurposes, like in this movie. But the most disturbingconsequences of such practices is human inability todistinguish reality from fantasy - if memory can bemanipulated, and people can't trust their own past, theyconsequently can't trust their present. The hero of thisfilm is constantly faced with such dilemma - areall-important events in this film real or just his fantasy?Movie leaves this question unanswered, forcing the audienceto watch it many times in order to find subtle clues. Thisunanswered question could have spawned the very same endlessdebate as the Android controversy in BLADE RUNNER.  Unfortunate thing for the reputation of TOTAL RECALL (andgood for its quality), was the fact that execution of thisscript had been left to Paul Verhoeven, author of ROBOCOP,another hidden gem of science fiction, made three yearsearlier. Verhoeven was never associated with cult sciencefiction, at least not with science fiction as infantileentertainment, dominant trend in 1980s. Verhoeven alwaysused Hollywood resources to paint subversive picture of somedisturbing trends of contemporary America, always disguisedas standard commercial films. TOTAL RECALL, perhaps, wasn'tso radical or obvious like ROBOCOP. However, some elementsof 1980s are still present in Verhoeven's vision of thefuture - some unknown yet recognisable variation of Cold Waris still fought somewhere in the background, corporate greedat the utter expense of Have Nots still dominates theeconomy, raw consumerism still dominates the culture and thekilling of helpless civilians and summary executions arenormal modus operandi of the legitimate government. Thisgrim picture is, on the other hand, well hidden with thehuge amounts of action, and consequent huge amounts ofviolence. That violence is most graphically depicted - fewfilms are able to show people literally stepping over deadbodies to achieve their goals. Verhoeven even manages toinsult feminists with scenes of nudity and with almostall-important female characters being portrayed as whores.The audience, however, barely has time to think about that,because Verhoeven turns the film in one big roller-coasterride, using non-stop action through superb editing.  Verhoeven did great job not only in directing very good andmemorable action scenes, and neatly tying them withthought-provoking and intelligent plot. He also managed tocreate specific atmosphere of the film, which was supposedto make huge Dickian contrast between brightsupertechnological future and its grim consequences forhuman beings. Production settings of futuristic Earth andMars colony are quite believable, and special effects, stillgood after having to compete with CGI for almost a decade,provide many memorable scenes, especially at the spectacularend of the film. Verhoeven obviously took great care aboutdetails, providing some amusing product placements (ads for""Mars Today"") and interesting in-jokes and pop culturereferences. Always reliable Jerry Goldsmith provides anothervery good musical score, quite appropriate for this film,quite in rank with his previous classics like ALIEN and STARTREK.  Some critics were led to disregard TOTAL RECALL because itslead actor was Arnold Schwarzenegger, until that time alwaysassociated with brainless action films (or, to be moreprecise, what mainstream critics used to call ""brainlessaction films""). In this film he again plays unstoppablekilling machine with almost superhuman abilities, but thereis difference; this time the machine happens to be veryhuman. Quaid is man who is suddenly forced to swap hisboring, but safe existence with constant life for life andthe struggle to find his true identity, and, above all, heis never sure whether he lives in a dream. Such trials andtribulations were nice opportunity for Schwarzenegger toshow some of his, usually unused, acting abilities. His roleshadowed everyone else, mostly because they had limitedscreen time. That happened even with great character actorslike Ronny Cox (who actually replayed his role of corporatevillain in ROBOCOP), Michael Ironside and even with hisnominal partner Rachel Ticotin. Some, on the other hand,provided great episodes - Ray Baker was nice as sleazy""Rekall"" executive and Mel Johnson Jr. gave quite humorousperformance as Martian cabby. But the most memorablesupporting role was played by Sharon Stone; her portrayal ofQuaid's treacherous wife prepared her very well for the roleof Catherine Trammel in BASIC INSTINCT, the most ultimateBad Girl of 1990s cinema.  Of course, there are some that aren't pleased with TOTALRECALL for quite different reasons. Most obvious flaw in themovie could be found by subjecting the movie to the basicscientific nit picking. The ending, although spectacular,seems unrealistic and as well as some scenes in Mars colony.However, those who like to defend TOTAL RECALL mightdisregard those nit-picks by seeing scientificimplausibilities as quite believable in the context ofQuaid's dream. All in all, TOTAL RECALL is well paced,entertaining and thought-provoking piece of science fictioncinema, a truly superb, yet disregarded gem of thatparticular genre. ",Total Recall,R,1990,3.5
884,"""Town & Country"" could have been a complete misfire; if anything, it had the makings of such. A troubled production filmed in 1998 that went through reshoots, reedits, thirteen different release dates, and even several reels of footage stolen at one point, it has finally been unleashed by New Line Cinemas nearly three years later. Aside from the occasional signs of unevenness (which most all films have to some degree) and a clumsy ending, the movie is, pleasantly enough, not a disaster, and actually makes for an enjoyable watch.  Porter Stoddard (Warren Beatty) is a successful architect living in a ritzy apartment on 5th Avenue in New York City, with a wife of twenty-five years, Ellie (Diane Keaton). Ellie believes they are still very much happy together, and Porter does love her, but that can't stop him from having a wandering eye that has recently lead him to an affair with a cellist (Nastassja Kinski). Porter and Ellie's best friends are another seemingly amiable married couple, Griffin (Garry Shandling) and Mona (Goldie Hawn). When Mona spots Griffin headed into a Bed-and-Breakfast with a redhead, she signs the divorce papers faster than Griffin can even come to terms with what has happened. This sudden relational earthquake causes Ellie to reevaluate her own marriage, and the pieces start falling into place.  Affairs and marital breakup don't exactly sound like a rollicking time at the movie theater, but as directed by Peter Chelsom (1998's ""The Mighty"") and written by Michael Laughlin and Buck Henry (who also costars as a divorce lawyer), ""Town & Country"" is a mostly smart, consistently funny farce reminiscent of the type you would have seen in the 1940s, albeit with more explicit sexual situations and coarser language.  The film does have the occasional dry patch, and certain characters jarringly disappear and then reappear much later, causing one to realize how long they have been missing from the story. The finale also comes off as overly choppy and unsatisfying, when it should have gotten more emotionally intimate. Still, there is much to like here, and the opening 90 minutes are good enough to save the decidedly sucky ending. There are also some laugh-out-loud moments that sparkle, both from the situations, the idea of the situations, and the top-notch actors involved.  Warren Beatty (1998's ""Bulworth"") makes for an exciting protagonist who does several unsavory things throughout, but remains accessible. He doesn't show up onscreen as much these days, so it is always a welcome addition to have him appear, especially in the leading man role. And at 64 years of age, Beatty looks great, and could easily pass for 50, which is probably closer to the age he is portraying.  Diane Keaton, who had recently seemed to be losing her acting touch in such mediocre performances as the ones in 1999's ""The Other Sister"" and 2000's ""Hanging Up,"" is the dramatic center of the piece, and flawless in her role. Rounding out the four major players, Garry Shandling (2000's ""What Planet Are You From?"") and Goldie Hawn (1999's ""The Out-of-Towners"") do well with their parts, and it is especially nice to see Hawn in a movie again, after a two-year hiatus. Hawn's Mona, however, is the most underwritten of the quartet, and her character, like Beatty's, doesn't always do the most savory of things.  The large supporting cast is filled from top to bottom with scene-stealing performers. Jenna Elfman (2000's ""Keeping the Faith"") is delightfully quirky as Auburn, a girl whom Porter has a chance encounter with on Halloween, with her dressed as Marilyn Monroe and him as a polar bear. A scene in which the two, in costume, wrestle around in the snow is priceless. Also making an impression is Andie MacDowell (1999's ""The Muse""), as Eugenie, another woman whom Porter has a brief fling with, only to discover that she has a weird obsession with stuffed animals. Finally, Josh Hartnett (2000's ""The Virgin Suicides"") is likable as the Stoddards' teenaged son.  Amidst the slapstick and zaniness, ""Town & Country"" attempts to tackle serious issues about marriage, relationships, faithfulness, and honesty, and doesn't quite pull it off. When the comedy is in high-gear, it works effortlessly, but whenever the drama settles in, it feels like an entirely different movie together (and the type that, yes, might have had a troubled shoot). A little more thought and care put into these passages might have helped. Still, as a silly, lighthearted confection, ""Town & Country"" succeeds admirably.",Town and Country,R,2001,2
885," TRAFFIC, by director and cinematographer Steven Soderbergh (ERIN BROCKOVICH and OUT OF SIGHT), is an intriguing and cautionary tale of human duality (good/evil, honest/corrupt, confident/desperate, powerful/hopeless, rich/poor, etc.) set against the background of drug trafficking and usage.  Using the canonical metaphor of a ""war"" against drugs, the script by Stephen Gaghan (RULES OF ENGAGEMENT) is loosely based on Simon Moore's television miniseries, ""Traffik,"" which was shown many years back on PBS.  (For the record, I found the movie similar in tone and quality to the miniseries, even if the two tell different stories.)  Unlike traditional warfare, the drug war has no real beginning or ending and few publicized heroes.  If there is an analogy to be made, the drug war is like the endless trench battles in World War I.  The ambitious TRAFFIC is constructed of 3 parallel and overlapping stories.  The highest profile one concerns Ohio Supreme Court Justice Robert Lewis (Michael Douglas), his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), and their 16-year-old daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen).  This is a dysfunctional family with their own internecine warfare.  Robert is bored.  Barbara is in denial.  And Caroline is generally stoned from freebasing, snorting and shooting up with her wealthy friends and with her low-rent drug dealers.  ""I'm really angry,"" Caroline (Erika Christensen) tells her AA group.  ""I'm angry about a lot of stuff.  I'm just not sure what.""  Incongruously, Robert is about to become the nation's next drug czar.  After learning of his daughter's habit, he approaches his upcoming job with a vengeance, but his call for ""out of the box"" thinking from his lieutenants generates dead silence.  The root cause of the unlimited demand for drugs is probably best summarized by one of Caroline's fellow AA members who calls alcoholism and drug addiction, ""allergies of the body and obsessions of the mind.""  In San Diego, undercover DEA agents Monty Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), are trying to trap mid-level trafficker Eddie Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer).  ""In Mexico, law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity,"" Eddie brags about how easy it is to pay off those on the other side of the border.  He is a cynic who likes to taunt the police.  ""Your life is pointless,"" Eddie reasons with Monty, since incarcerating some drug dealers just means that someone else will sell users the drugs that they want to get high.  Eddie views drugs as inevitable, so why shouldn't he be the one to prosper from their sale?  Steven Bauer plays Eddie's boss, Carlos Ayala, and Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Carlos's pregnant wife, Helena.  Helena's all too rapid arc from good to bad is one of the story's few disappointments.  In Mexico, low-level policeman Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), who makes the princely sum of $316 a month, and his partner, Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), go to work for Mexico's chief drug official, General Salazar (Tomas Milian).  Like their American counterparts, they are trying to work their way up the food chain to the top members of their nation's distribution network, in their case, the Tijuana cartel.  General Salazar's men, however, have more powerful tools of their trade, with torture and murder being two of their more dramatic ones.  The film's large cast, which also includes Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, Dennis Quaid and Peter Riegert, are well utilized.  One almost feels sorry for those actors whom Soderbergh didn't invite to be in his film.  The movie is surprisingly slow paced for its subject matter and in need of another editing pass to trim off some of the fat.  The story itself is fascinating with the notable exception of the unconvincing action of one character towards the end, which plays like a cheap bit of moralizing by the screenwriter.    All of the above notwithstanding, what the viewers are most likely to remember a year later is the film's imaginative cinematography.  Mexico is filmed in warm yellows and browns, reflecting the land's heat and poverty.  A cool blue, like blue suits reflected off of marble columns, is used for the seats of power in government.  And bright primary, like from an expensive decorating magazine, are used for the settings of the wealthy.  Even before the characters speak, Soderbergh's color scheme alone has already told us much about them.  TRAFFIC runs too long at 2:27.  It is rated R for pervasive drug content, strong language, violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers. ",Traffic,R,2001,3.5
886,"    It's obvious why perennial good-guy Denzel Washington was intriguedby the malevolent role of veteran L.A.P.D. Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris, whoheads an elite, undercover narcotics squad. He's a dedicated rogue cop who'sglib that ""you gotta have a little dirt on you for anyone to trust you."" His""street justice"" ethics and morality are outside the norm but he has his ownambiguous integrity. So when Jake Hoyt, an idealistic rookie, played by EthanHawke, wants to join his unit, Harris gives him 24 hours to prove himselfsaying, ""You've got today and today only to show me what you're madeof....You've got to decide if you're a sheep or a wolf."" Their day begins withdrugs and alcohol, part of ""getting to know the streets,"" and includesextortion, execution, and a $4 million seizure, which quickly decreases to $3million as the corrupt cops take their cut. ""It's ugly but it's necessary,""rationalizes Harris. ""Play the game, grow wise and then you can change things.""Both Washington and Hawke deliver, supported by Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, SnoopDogg, Macy Gray and Dr. Dre. But David Ayer's implausible, clich_-filledscreenplay veers off in several directions with too many far-fetchedcoincidences. Certainly a subplot involving the Russian Mafia is irrelevant and,right now, after the World Trade Center, the timing seems inappropriate forgratuitous police corruption and brutality. Director Antoine Fuqua brings acinematic restlessness, street smarts and a touch of slick senationalism to thispolice thriller which all-too-soon becomes pedestrian, even sadistic, with anunsatisfying conclusion. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Training Day""is a gritty, foul-mouthed 6, questioning whether law enforcement comes at theexpense of justice and public safety. ",Training Day,R,2001,3
887,"""Trapped,"" a particularly grisly kidnapping thriller directed by LuisMandoki (2001's ""Angel Eyes""), is being released at the wrong timeunder the wrong circumstances. With numerous child abduction casessweeping the country as of late, Columbia Pictures has wrongfullydecided to downplay the marketing of the picture, barring the actorsfrom promoting it and sending it out into theaters without advancescreenings for reviews. What the studio has done, then, is shot itsown film in the foot, more or less ensuring its failure to find an audience.  That said, ""Trapped"" is undoubtedly superior to the majority of theatricalreleases that come out without early press screenings. A studio hidinga movie almost always means one thing--it is a veritable dud (see""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" for a recent example)--but ""Trapped""is taut, well-made on a technical level, and memorably performed.It also happens to be thoroughly unpleasant. For all of the expertisefound in front of and behind the camera, it cannot shield the somewhatcheap manipulation it holds by providing entertainment in the formof a harmless child being kidnapped and having her life constantly threatened. Anesthesiologist Will Jennings (Stuart Townsend) and wife Karen (CharlizeTheron) are a wealthy young couple who share a spacious lakeside homein the state of Washington with six-year-old daughter Abby (DakotaFanning). No sooner has Will set off for a conference in a nearbytown is Abby ruthlessly snatched away from Karen by Marvin (PruittTaylor Vince). The main perpetrator, Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon), takesKaren hostage, informing her that Abby will be returned if his $250,000ransom is met in 24 hours. Meanwhile, Joe's wife and partner, Cheryl(Courtney Love), confronts Will of the news about his daughter. Whatthese veteran kidnappers do not expect, however, is that Karen andWill are strong-willed individuals themselves who refuse to play the ""helpless victims."" ""Trapped"" gets off to a too-rapid start that hampers all of its earlymoments. The viewer is hardly given more than a brief glimpse of itslead heroes, Karen and Will, before they are thrust into the high-stakes,life-threatening plot. By cutting to the chase without a moment ofhesitation proves problematic because, through the course of the film,you must find a way to care and sympathize for the characters on yourown. In truth, very little depth is ever presented to Karen and Will,aside from the basic roles they take in their lives and their cunningabilities to outwit the villains. As the desperate-beyond-words KarenJennings, Charlize Theron (2001's ""Sweet November"") runs the emotionalgamut from angry to seductive to horrified and gives the part herall. But Stuart Townsend, as husband Will, is not nearly as arrestinghere as he was in 2002's ""Queen of the Damned."" As reliably predictable and typical as the plot developments in ""Trapped""are, credit screenwriter Greg Iles (who also wrote the novel ""24 Hours""from which it is based upon) for giving the kidnappers a mildly believablepurpose and a clear consciousness behind their icy facades. Likewise,Kevin Bacon (2000's ""Hollow Man"") and, especially, Courtney Love (1999's""Man on the Moon""), are utterly captivating as criminals Joe and Cheryl.Bacon, who can effortlessly float between the most virtuous and inhumaneof roles, is wickedly good as he attempts to both threaten and seduceKaren. For Love, this is the meatiest performances she has given since1996's ""The People vs. Larry Flynt,"" portraying Cheryl as a womanwhose forceful first impression gives way to a notably more insecureperson who can't help but regret many of the decisions she has made in her past. ""Trapped"" spins its wheels for the first hour, emotionally unsettling,but a clear rehash of 1996's Mel Gibson/Rene Russo picture, ""Ransom.""The ways in which Karen and Will inevitably turn the tables on theircaptors are old hat by now--for Will, beating Cheryl down by revealingthe scared person she really is, and for Karen, using her sexual desirabilityto wrap Joe around her finger. The surprisingly elaborate climax,on the other hand, boasts a set of thrilling action set-pieces (oneinvolving a falling helicopter, another concerning a mass trafficaccident), and an undoubted showmanship that is quite impressive.Still, to what end does director Luis Mandoki's overblown action work serve? There is a curious off-putting quality to ""Trapped"" that gnaws atyou, even as you are intrigued by its performances, its style (thegloomy, atmospheric cinematography by Frederick Elmes and the latePiotr Sobicinski), and, yes, its staircase to almost unbearable intensity.The premise is a dead-serious one, but the subject matter is not treatedseriously. Nearly every twist and turn is carefully, but too obviously,orchestrated to provide neat, ""movie""-style explanations. There isan element of needless exploitation that ""Trapped"" ultimately nevertranscends, particularly as director Mandoki reveals his single-mindedintention to provide nothing more substantial than ""mindless entertainment."" ",Trapped,R,2002,2.5
888," First, let me confess that I have never read much Kafka other thancollecting some of his classic quotes (see appendix).  Based on what Ido know, THE TRIAL appears to be quintessential Kafka.  THE TRIAL starts with the arrest of what we would call a SeniorVice President of a large bank, but it is set in Prague before the turnof the century so he is call a chief clerk (pronounced ""clark"" in trueBritish fashion) of the bank.  The clerk is played excellently by KyleMacLachlan.  Although arrested, he is free to go and is never told thecharges.  The clerk is arrogant and tells everyone how ridiculous this allis.  But in a world of non-Euclidean geometry, everything that seemsright isn't.  Slowly the clerk begins to realizes the trouble he is in.When he goes to the court he sees long lines of people who are accused.No one actually goes on trial.  Everyone waits.  Finally, he gets the court painter to explain to him that he hasonly three chances: actual acquittal, ostensible acquittal, andperpetual postponement.  The first has never happened, the second hasthe side effect that you can always be brought up again for the samecharge, and the last means you must spend all of your waking hoursmaking sure that you case never advances.  From there, his plight getsworse.  Other than Kafka's story and MacLachlan's acting, the high pointis the screen play by Harold Pinter.  Pinter has a style most typifiedby the movie Betrayal, of a highly verbal almost Shakespearean stylethat has the actors taking every word very seriously with constantripostes between each other.  The direction, settings, and especially the dramatic brasssymphonic music are all good.  I give the movie ** 1/2, and recommendit.  Now, as promised, here are my 3 favorite Kafka quotes:  I have the true feeling of myself only when I am unbearablyunhappy.    -Franz Kafka  You are free and that is why you are lost.   *nbsp;-Franz Kafka  People become obsessed with the patterns they create.  In a Kafkastory the salesman wakes up one morning and finds he has beentransformed into a huge ugly bug.  What does he do? Does he contemplatethis awful change in himself? Nope.  He worries about how he's going toturn his clumsy new body over and get out of bed, how he's going to belate to the office, and what his boss will think.    -Richard O'Mara ","Trial, The",PG-13,1994,2.5
889,"      THE TRIGGER EFFECT is a Hitchcockian thriller about everyone beingreduced to their most basic instincts, the bottom of their Maslowtriangle.  Through a massive and long lasting power outage peoplerevert to animal behavior.  Much like TESTAMENT, this show presents aconvincing tale of what could happen.  After the ten state power outagethis month, the show is especially topical.       THE TRIGGER EFFECT is written and directed by first time directorDavid Koepps.  His writing credits include MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, THEPAPER, and JURRASIC PARK so he is skilled with the art of tension.Here the show is a massive web of tension.       The film opens with two coyotes eating their kill.  This isfollowed by a fast cut to a nearby power plant.  Soon we cut again to ascene at a movie theater.  As in SLACKER, the scene moves from person Ato B and then B to C, etc.  Each time there is an incident that almosthappens and doesn't, but the writer serves notice that you can expectthese characters back again.       Matthew (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elisabeth Shue) return homeafter getting cussed at in the theater.  They are pretty shook up, butsoon forget it as Annie starts turning Matthew on.  Just when they areabout to make love, baby Sarah cries out loudly.  This great littlescene ends as they immediately start a game of rock-paper-scissors tosee who will have to go sit with Sarah.       Soon the power goes out.  It is a hot and sticky night so this isa terrible inconvenience.  They look outside, and the whole city isdark.       When they wake up, the power is still off, and their baby's earinfection has gotten much worse.  She must get medicine, but the phonesand the radio are out too.       Now the terror starts.  The pharmacist will not give Matthew themedicine because the doctor is unreachable.  Put yourself in Matthew'sshoes.  Imagine the horror of your baby getting sicker and sicker, andyet the drugs she needs are so close you can almost reach over thecounter and touch them.  It is at this point that the bounds of normalcivilized behavior begin to get violated.  This ordinary man gettingcaught in circumstances beyond his control is a classic Hitchcocktheme.       Their high school friend Joe (Dermot Mulroney) comes by, and theybegin to discuss what caused the outage and how bad the situation is.He gives out a lot of theories, many funny including ""The Martians havelanded.  They want our women.""  Eventually he gets serious and says hehas heard reports of massive looting and killing.   He and Matthew goand buy a gun to protect themselves.       After a while this all becomes a lark, and they drive into town tosee what is happening.  I have friends that drove into Manhattan fromNew Jersey during a massive power outage in the late 70s so I know thisis a normal reaction for some.       The second night finds the three of them together in thecandlelight of Matthew and Annie's house.  After too much wine, aromantic triangle begins to develop.  The script is excellentthroughout.  A great mixture of tremendous tension followed by a littlehumor.  After one fight, Anne tells them, ""Boys, if you can't playnice, we're aren't going to have any more of these little sleepovers.""At one point Matthew asks a cop, ""Is it bad out there?""  But the copjust replies, ""Out where?""       The rest of the show has them coping with an ever more hostileenvironment.  People revert back more and more to their animalancestry.  Every few minutes, the tension ratchets up some more.       This is not a show where suspension of disbelief is necessary.  Aspresented, it is all plausible and is made even more so by someexcellent pieces of acting by the cast.  Shue (from LEAVING LAS VEGASand ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING) and MacLachlan give fascinatingperformances.  People in ordinary circumstances sometimes are forced todo things they would never consider otherwise.       Small parts of the script really hit home.  None of the plasticworks.  Only cash is accepted.  In the power outage this month we werein a toy store trying to buy something with my credit card when it wasmade inoperable without power.  Moreover, without power no one couldfigure out the price nor would I have had exact change anyway.       The low and pervasive music by James Newton Howard serves as aChinese water torture on the audience.  Editor Jill Savitt knows justwhen to cut so that the audience stays on the edge of their seats.Many small scenes are excellent.  One of my favorites is a bigconfrontation with guns that gets resolved amicably in a surprisingway.       THE TRIGGER EFFECT runs 2:02.  It is rated R.  There is no sex ornudity, and generally the language is pretty mild.  There is someviolence, but nothing gory.  I think the film would be fine for mostkids ten and up, regardless of the rating.  I recommend this thrillerto you and award it ***. ","Trigger Effect, The",R,1996,2
890,"Whether it be the fault of the screenplay or miscast actors, the admirablylofty intentions of ""Troy"" to be a large-scale historical epic gotlost somewhere along its journey to the screen. The $150-million budgetis, for the most part, widely apparent on the screen. From scenesin which a thousand ships set sale across the ocean to the technicallyimpressive, engulfing battle sequences between seemingly hundred ofthousands of warriors, there is no doubt that this is a handsomelymounted motion picture. What ""Troy"" has in visual spectacle, however,it lacks in depth and emotion. All of the pretty shots in the worldcan't make up for the film's completely hollow core. Upon a peace offering made between at-odds Greek cities Sparta andTroy, Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) falls in love with Paris of Troy(Orlando Bloom) and escapes back to Troy with he and his elder brother,Hector (Eric Bana), leaving her mismatched husband, Menelaus (BrendanGleeson), in the dust. This single action of Helen, said to be themost beautiful woman in the world, and Paris, leads to an uprisingin Sparta. With the help of brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) and warriorhero Achilles (Br ad Pitt) willing to do his bidding, Menelaus sendshis thousands of troops to Troy to destroy the city once and for all and reclaim Helen. Those familiar with Homer's famous ancient poem, ""The Illiad"" (whichthis film is loosely based upon), will have no trouble following theplot trajectory of ""Troy."" The story is pretty simple, a cut-and-dryaffair that pits the Spartans against Troy in a battle waged not onlybecause of Helen, but for what amounts to victory bragging rights.Where director Wolfgang Petersen (2000's ""The Perfect Storm"") and,in turn, the viewer gets confused is on which side they should be rooting for. On Troy's side, we have Helen, who simply wanted to leave an unhappycircumstance in order to be with Paris, and the other characters met,including Paris and Hector's father, King Priam (Peter O'Toole), andHector's beloved wife, Andromache (Saffron Burrows), are also treatedwith a sympathetic hand. However, fighting for Sparta is Achilles,beheld as one of the greatest warriors who ever lived. That he isplayed by toplining matinee idol Brad Pitt (2001's ""Ocean's Eleven"")and is also viewed objectively is where things get sticky, especiallyconsidering his muscles and ripped body get more play time than hedoes. The lack of a decided viewpoint from screenwriter David Benioff(2002's ""25th Hour"") nags at the viewer, leaving them indifferentto all the carnage on the screen. It doesn't help that ""Troy,"" at least for its first act, plays likea candidate for ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" None of the threeleads»Brad Pitt, Eric Bana (2003's ""Hulk""), and Orlando Bloom (2003's""Pirates of t he Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"")»are plausiblein their roles, appearing at all times as if they are amateurs froma low-rent dinner theater simply playing dress up. Not only do theyhave difficulty in embodying their parts, but they are all too aestheticallyperfect, with their hair coifed and flowing and their muscles bulgingamidst metal armor, to pass themselves off as people who might havelived in approximately 1250 B.C. There are times, indeed, when ""Troy""seems more concerned with showing off its male cast member's nakedtorsos and bare backsides than actually telling a historically andemotionally resonating story. This is one instance where Brad Pitt'sgorgeous looks betray him. The movie becomes more involving in the second half, if only becausethe battle scenes are pleasing to look at and astonishing in theirscope. There is also a wonderful scene»easily the most poignant inthe film»where King Priam comes to enemy Achilles to p lead for thebody of his son back. Veteran actor Peter O'Toole, who has not beenrecently given nearly enough dramatic work to do, easily deliversthe best performance, bringing distinct levels of honor, regret, andpathos to King Priam when all the characters surrounding him don'tseem to have three dimensions. The climax, in which Sparta fools itsopponents and finds a way to get past the walls of Troy, is arrestingand primal in a way that the other fighting sequences miss the boaton. The majority of ""Troy"" is simply plodding. By the end of ""Troy,"" audiences are likely to react with indifference.What is on view diverts the viewer's attention, for the most part,but there is nobody to latch onto and care about, nor does what eitherside is fighting for seem worth it. Sparta merely seems to want toprove they are stronger than Troy, while Troy retaliates out of dutyand for the concern of Helen. But why? Helen, as played by newcomerDiane Kruger, is a blank slate, a boring, pretty face without a personalityor soul. ""Troy"" yearns to be an epic for the ages, something alongthe lines of 2000's ""Gladiator,"" but it is more reminiscent of a cheesyHarlequin romance that just so happens to have lots of big battles and expensive effects.",Troy,R,2004,2.5
891,"From the moment he signed his name on the dotted line, _The_Truman_Show_has been touted as Jim Carrey's big dramatic breakthrough (never mind thathe won numerous critical kudos for his work in the Emmy-nominated TV movie_Doing_Time_on_Maple_Drive_).  Carrey indeed does a fine job in PeterWeir's clever fantasy, but to focus all attention on his refreshingchange-of-pace turn is to discount the superior accomplishment of thosebehind the scenes--and to give Carrey a bit _too_much_ credit.  Carrey's Truman Burbank has a nice house, white picket fence and all, inthe idyllic oceanside community of Seahaven; a loyal wife, Meryl (LauraLinney); an even more loyal best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich); and acushy desk job.  If it sounds like a pretty picture from the TV screen,that's because it is.  Unbeknownst to Truman, the entire life he has livedis mere programming for a 24-hour television network.  Seahaven is onelarge soundstage, where all events are scripted and all the inhabitants areactors--that is, except for Truman, who was adopted as an infant by theOmnicam Corporation, and has had every step of his life traced and moldedby _The_Truman_Show_'s creator, Christof (Ed Harris).  In addition to having an inventive plot hook, Andrew Niccol's screenplayis expertly structured.  In its first minute, the basic outline of thecomplex premise is made perfectly clear through a faux television creditroll and soundbites from Meryl, Marlon (or, rather, the actors who playthem), and Christof.  For about the next hour, Niccol and Weir thrust theaudience directly into Truman's world, allowing them to experience forthemselves the surreal, synthetic way of ""life"" in Seahaven before goinginto a more detailed backstory that fills in the few holes.  In theprocess, the viewer is given a much more vivid and entertaining picture ofTruman's situation.  Truman is not as dumb as Christof or other crew members think, and hebegins to catch on to the grand charade that is his life when no one willlet him leave town.  The resulting conflict, within himself and witheveryone and everything around him, provides Carrey ample opportunity tostretch while staying within comfortable acting bounds.  He gets to cry(and convincingly at that) onscreen and play a fairly earnest character asa whole, but he does make concessions to his core comedic audience.  WhenTruman's suspicions grow, the more unhinged he gets, setting the stage forsome funny rubberfaced antics (no butt-talking, though--thankfully).  However, his performance is not the Oscar-baiting tour-de-force that anumber of sources would lead you to believe.  Carrey's shortcoming is mostclearly brought to light in one key subplot.  Although he likes Meryl, thelove of his life is Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), a fetching young woman whomhe barely knew in college.  Like the rest, Sylvia was an actress playing apart, but when she broke script and actually fell for him, she was hastilyremoved from the Seahaven set and the _Truman_ cast.  Truman was told thatshe and her ""father"" moved to Fiji, and it's his longing for her that makeshim want to leave town.  This thread is supposed to be _Truman_'s emotionalhook, but it doesn't quite work for a couple of reasons.  The character ofSylvia, who goes on to be the leader of the ""Free Truman"" movement, issketchily written, as are the reasons behind her deep feelings for Truman;and, as evidenced in _Liar_Liar_, Carrey just isn't that convincing when itcomes to sentiment.  Granted, _Truman_ is nowhere near as sappy as thatfilm (not to mention the sap felt out of place there), but, while he is alikable presence, Carrey doesn't have much of a natural emotional rapportwith the audience or, for that matter, his co-stars.  As such, one mayempathize with Truman's desire to break free, but not necessarily feel forthe romantic plight that motivates that desire.  Hence, the bravura work on display in _The_Truman_Show_ is that of Niccoland Weir, who have crafted a subtly layered, perceptive, and pointedlytruthful commentary on the media and its and our own voyeuristictendencies.

892,"      THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS is a light hearted and delightfulretelling of the CYRANO DE BERGERAC story.  It is a fun movie with nota lot of substance, but with plenty of style and wit.  Although notquite as good Steve Martin's version called ROXANNE, it neverthelesshas a script by Audrey Wells that is superb - full of intelligenthumor.  Although it is certainly no laugh riot, there are many jokes,small and large, to keep your attention and fix a smile on your face.Not only does the script possess creative humor, it fashions compellingcharacters for whom the audience really cares.  A lightweight showcertainly, but a sweet one.       Dr. Abby Barnes (Janeane Garofolo) is a radio talk showveterinarian whose show is called ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs.""  Oneday a photographer called Brian (Ben Chaplin) calls in with a problemhe is having with a wonderful big dog named Hank (Hank the Dog).  Hankis upset because he has to be on roller skates for the picture.  Brianfalls for Abby's voice, but Abby lacks self-confidence with her looksso she lies about whom she is.  Actually she is a short but a littlechunky brunette with a lovely and attractive smile.  Nevertheless, shetells Brain that she is her tall, thin, blonde, and gorgeous neighborNoelle Slusarsky (Uma Thurman).       The next day on the phone, Abby asks Brian, ""How'd it go?""  withHank.  He says, ""he snored, but we stood it.""  She inquires, ""How'd youdo it?"", and he explains, ""He slept on my face so I couldn't hear him.""       Noelle doesn't understand Abby's lack of sexual activity, asking,""You gotta have a boyfriend, don't you?  Otherwise it's just you, acat, and 40 candles on your birthday cake.""  Abby envies Noelle'sbeauty, telling her, ""You burp and guys think its adorable.  You pukeand they line up to hold your hair back.""  Noelle on the other hand,does not like her life as a model, explaining, ""I don't eat anything soI can look good on the outside, but on the inside, there's nothing.""       During most of the movie we have almost five foot Abby hanging outwith almost six foot Noelle and creating some hilarious visuals.  Theonly major dirty word in the show is a single use of the F-word byNoelle in a great line that almost had me double over in laughter.Both of the actresses are good, but this is Garofolo's show.  She isterrific - strong, witty, vulnerable, and extremely humorous.  Herfunny line at the end of the movie is the best part of the show.       Thurman does a good job of making Noelle into an airhead withoutresorting to caricature.  After Brian gives her a book, Noelle isshocked saying, ""nobody has ever given me a book before that doesn'thave pictures in it.""       Chaplin has a limited role as the sweet and boyishly handsomeboyfriend.  He does this well, but the stars are the two female leads,and he is there strictly to complement them.  Once Abby puts him to thetest by wanting to know, ""If you are trapped in Biosphere 3, whom wouldyou want to bring: Time's Woman of the Year or Playboy's Bunny of theYear?""  Okay guys, what would you have answered?       I do not know exactly what constitutes a ""chick flick,"" but thelarge audience on opening night was over three quarters women with moreall female couples than mixed sex couples so perhaps this is a chickflick.  As a male however, I was just as impressed by the show as wasmy wife.       I like the way, the art of long and intelligent telephoneconversation is a central part of the film.  The film really teachesyou that beauty is more than skin deep.  Actually, I thought thereshould have been more of a contrast between Abby's looks and Noelle's.Abby's clothes are suitably clunky, but Noelle's frocks are too plainand her make-up too washed out.  In contrast, Abby had great make-up.I would pick Abby every time as would I suspect will most intelligentmen watching the show.       THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS & DOGS runs a fast 1:37 thanks to goodediting and pacing by editor Stephen Semel and director MichaelLehmann.  It is correctly rated PG-13.  There are only a few bad words,no violence, no nudity, and the sex is limited to the telephone.  Isuspect the film would be fine for most kids over 10.  I recommend theshow to you and give it ***. ","Truth About Cats & Dogs, The",PG-13,1996,2.5
893," Writer-director Gavin O'Connor's ""Tumbleweeds"" bears more than a passing resemblance to another current film, ""Anywhere But Here,"" starring Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Higher-profile and with bigger stars, the latter Hollywood version, for once, is actually superior to its indie counterpart, particularly in its more intimate screenplay. That isn't to say ""Tumbleweeds"" is a failure, however, as it boasts remarkably natural performances from the two leading ladies. It is these two actresses, and a handful of memorable supporting work, that buoy the film above mediocrity as, ultimately, the story itself is overly familiar and occasionally by-the-numbers, especially in its portrayal of domestic abuse.  At the opening, 40-year-old Mary Jo Walker (Janet McTeer) is being assaulted once again by her nasty-tempered husband. He's her fourth hubby (she has problems saying, ""no,"" to marriage proposals), but she also is not the kind of woman who will allow being mistreated. Soon after, she and her preadolescent daughter Ava (Kimberly J. Brown) have hit the road, like they always do when Mary Jo has man troubles, headed in no particular direction. They have never seen the beach, so they end up moving to San Diego, CA, where Mary Jo gets a job as an office secretary and Ava becomes fast friends at school with fellow classmates Zoe (Ashley Buccille) and Adam (Cody McMains). After a chance meeting with Jack Ranson (Gavin O'Connor), a truck driver who previously had helped fix their car, Mary Jo, once again, believes that Jack is ""the"" one, and before long, Mary Jo and Ava have moved in with him. Ava clearly doesn't like Jack; she can see right through his thin facade, and fears that if the relationship between her mother and him grows rocky, she will find herself uprooted to another town somewhere else.  As a mother-daughter tale, ""Tumbleweeds"" is meticulous and believable. The relationship between Mary Jo and Ava is so very unaffected because the screenplay, by O'Connor and Angela Shelton, knows exactly what goes on between a close parent and child. The dialogue exchanges between the two are also right on the money, as is the casting of the two central roles.  Janet McTeer, an English stage actress, is exceptional, not only pulling off a southern accent with nary a flaw in sight, but also transforming Mary Jo into a strong-willed woman whose best friend is her daughter, and gives her all the love and care a child should have. That isn't to say Mary Jo is perfect; she grows scared and dispirited if she doesn't have a husband or boyfriend at all times, and, inevitably, also seems to pick the wrong men. Mary Jo fools herself into believing a man stands for security and can fill up the missing hole in her personal character, but all it really does is cause her constant hardships. When things don't seem to be going well, Mary Jo simply packs up (and sometimes even leaves her belongings) and sets off for another town, never looking back.  Kimberly J. Brown, as Ava, has the more difficult role because she is the one who acts as the voice of reason for her mother. Ava is dedicated and loyal to Mary Jo, rarely ever complaining about her severely dysfunctional life of settling down and moving out, but she is also growing into a teenager, and realizes that running away isn't the answer for everything. Brown, a newcomer to feature films, is not at all a child actor who mugs in front of the camera, or attempts to steal a scene away from others. She doesn't need to, because she often does this without even trying. Brown compliments Ava as a girl on the edge of her teenage years, still in the learning process of boyfriends and kissing. Ava can sometimes act spoiled or bratty, but that only comes with the territory of being a child, and otherwise, is a likable character who we can't help but follow with a close eye through the story.  Lending fine support are two impressive supporting turns by Laurel Holloman, as Mary Jo's friend and coworker Laurie, and Jay O. Sanders, as Dan Miller, a kind widower who may be the perfect match for Mary Jo, if only she could see it. In the subplot involving Dan, the turnout isn't exactly as expected, but seems nothing if not truthful to the characters.  When Jack Ranson, played by writer-director Gavin O'Connor, enters the picture as Mary Jo's new blossoming boyfriend, the film instantly becomes more conventional and predictable. We, as the audience, know that Jack isn't quite as charming as he may appear to be at first glance, and it is inescapable that bliss will only last so long, and Mary Jo will want to get out of San Diego as quickly as possible. There then will be a confrontation where Ava will attempt to get her mother to understand they don't have to run away any longer, that she is her own person and her life shouldn't have to revolve around that of men.   The way ""Tumbleweeds"" ends is understated and, looking back, very little is solved. Without giving anything away, it is unavoidable to wonder whether Mary Jo really will follow through with her new path in life or not, and Ava's blossoming sexuality is cause for concern. Ava may be the one that sees the mistakes her mother makes, but you have to question whether she might end up just like her when she gets a little older. ""Tumbleweeds"" is a delicate drama, short on plot but rich in memorable characters. It may have its fair share of shortcomings, but the stunning work by McTeer and Brown is cause for celebration, all by itself. ",Tumbleweeds,PG-13,1999,2.5
894,"Small-time drug dealer Diamond (Pras from the rap group The Fugees) hasaspirations.  He  wants to trade in his life of guns and drugs for a musiccontract.  ""I want to be legitimate,"" he says earnestly to his music managerand fellow coke-dealer, Gage, played by real-life hip-hopper Ja Rule.  ""Iwant to earn some respect."" An admitted perfectionist when it comes to creating his sound, Diamond has amuch more flexible attitude when it comes to ethics.  Using his shiny guns,he is happy to waste anyone gets in his way.  But even he has limits.  Themorality test that separates the men from the boys or, in case of TURN ITUP, the vicious killers from the really vicious killers, involves aninnocent, Spanish-speaking, pregnant woman who witnesses Diamond and Gagemurdering a bunch of other dealers.  In a minor moral moment, Diamondinsists that Gage let her go.  One wonders what was it that tipped thescales in her favor.  Would the pregnancy alone have been enough?  Probablynot, since Diamond argues with Gage that not only is she pregnant but, sinceshe doesn't speak English, she couldn't turn them in. Even if the script by the director, Robert Adetuyi doesn't work as amorality tale, it does form the basis for some interesting set pieces todemonstrate Adetuyi's skills in staging scenes.  Handsomely lit and shot bycinematographer Hubert Taczanowski, the movie is a real treat for the eyes.Your ears, however, may complain that there's little for them.  When theactors aren't speaking, they strut upon the stage with impressive verve.But when they start reading their lines, you realize how vacuous the scriptis.  Even ignoring its propensity for non-stop profanity, there is little toadmire about it.  With miniscule plot and character development, the scriptleaves the visuals to carry the movie.  And that's asking for some prettyheavy lifting. What do we learn of the characters? Well, Diamond is a freedom-loving man who refuses even to give hisgirlfriend his cell phone number, equating that to the umbilical cord thatonce bound men to their mothers.  Gage has a succinct statement of humandesires.  He says that all we want is ""money, drugs and hos.""  Gage isaghast when a big record producer named Mr. White -- yes, he is -- wants tohear a demo tape before hiring Diamond.  The audacity! This much can be said.  After enduring many ugly bad movies, I, for one,appreciate having a bad movie that it is at least handsomely filmed andcompetently directed.   TURN IT UP runs 1:23.  It is rated R for strong violence, language and somedrug content and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.",Turn It Up,R,2000,1.5
895,"      From the director (Jan De Bont) of last year's best action movie,SPEED, we have TWISTER about teams of risk taking meteorologistschasing tornadoes.  Surprisingly, TWISTER is one boring movie pepperedwith some nifty effects.  It was so bad that had it not been forwanting to see all the special effects, I would have been ready to walkout.  Since the characters are not believable, you do not care if theycome into harm's way, and hence the special effects, althoughtechnically impressive, are never frightening.  As Melissa (Jami Gertz)says in the show about another subject, ""Funny thing is.  I'm not thatupset.""  I felt that way about the tornadoes in the film.       TWISTER is actually three movies for the cost of one.  First,there is the love triangle between Bill Harding (Bill Paxton), hisabout to be divorced wife Jo (Helen Hunt), and his new fiance Melissa.Second, we have the race against the evil meteorologist team lead byJonas (Cary Elwes).  Finally, there are the special tornado effectsdemonstrations by Industrial Light and Magic.       The film starts with a big tornado in June 1969.  This is time weleft our home in the tornado country shown in the film to go to gradschool at Berkeley in earthquake country.  The film makes you thinkthat a lot of people living in the tornado belt have tornado shelters.This is just not true.  I saw one in my entire life, and that was atsomeone's house who was afraid the Commies were going to drop the bigone on him.  Also not considered in the film are the issue of warnings.We got them all of the time.  So what.  What were we going to do?Also, if you are warned all of the time, you soon learn to eitherignore it or just worry a lot.  All of this notwithstanding, I was ableto suspend disbelief, but the film is so bad it didn't help.       Soon the movie switches to the present.  A team of ragtagmeteorologists lead by Jo is trying to place a measuring device called,what else, a Dorothy, in the middle of a tornado.  They drive a bunchof beat-up vehicles that look like they will fall apart at any moment.Their pompous rival, Jonas, has stolen all of their ideas, and withcorporate sponsorship, the latest in technology, and a big fleet ofsinister jet black vehicles, is ready to smash Jo's group to get hismeasuring device up first.  The subplot has Jo's soon to be ex-husbandand ex-partner Bill coming along one more time for the ride.  Billbrings along his new fiance Melissa.       Jo tells us that the ""biggest series of storms in twelve years iscoming"".  The original script by Michael Crichton is ridiculous.  Heshould stick to books.  Jonas tells Bill, ""Today we're going to makehistory, so stick around.  The days of dirt sniffing are over.""  Besidethe trite lines, the movie telegraphs every punch for some reason.Aren't they supposed to be trying to scare us?  Consider just oneexample.  For some reason the tornado chasers decide to stop at adrive-in movie to get a cup of coffee while the drive-in is playing thehorror classic THE SHINING.  What do you think will happen?  The setupis so contrived.       Look, the special effects are just that, special in this movie.They are technically brilliant, but without a good script andcharacters that come alive, after a while I found the effectsrepetitious and boring.  Technically brilliant certainly, but stuck ina lifeless movie.       Other than the technically impressive special effects, I likedseeing Hunt and Paxton.  Hunt is so smart, tough, and sensual all atonce.  Paxton is a great minor actor I have enjoyed for a long time.As much as I was glad to see them again, I never found their charactersin the movie believable.  The show is funny in parts as when a largecow keeps flying by them as in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Finally, kudos forthe nice computer graphics.  Realistic without being overdone.       TWISTER runs 1:45.  It is rated PG-13.  There is no sex, nonudity, almost no bad language and no violence other than the naturalviolence caused by tornadoes.  The shots of the tornadoes trivializesthe human suffering and dwells mostly with flying objects and propertydamage.  The film would be fine for any kid over say 8.  There is noshow; there are only special effects, and these are not enough for meto recommend this disappointing film.  To be fair, I should point outthat my wife liked the film.  The large audience where I saw it waspretty subdued, so I do not know how much most people will like it.  Igive the film * 1/2, but only for the special effects. ",Twister,PG-13,1996,2.5
896,"Writer/director Raymond De Felitta's TWO FAMILY HOUSE, set on Staten Islandin 1956, is a delightful movie that works on two levels.  On one, it is anamalgamation of the best of the 1950's sitcoms from ""The Honeymooners"" to""The Life of Riley.""  On the other, it is a richly evocative drama thateasily wins your heart.  Full of honest moments, even if always told with acomedic flair, the film feels like a blend of a true story and a fairy tale. Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli) has a dream of being a famous singer.  Oncehe almost realized it when Arthur Godfrey asked him to come in for anaudition.  Buddy didn't, but Julius LaRosa did, and Buddy has forever sinceregretted it.  He is a blue-collar worker who makes his living as amachinist, but he has had a series of failed, small-business ventures.Finally, he sees a way to make his dreams come true. He buys a dilapidated two-family house in which he plans to live in upstairswhile singing in a yet-to-be-constructed bar downstairs.  This means that heand his wife, Estelle (Kathrine Narducci, ""The Sopranos""), can stop livingwith her parents as they have been for the past 10 years.  (""The Perry ComoShow,"" which transfixes the in-laws, has been providing Buddy and Estellethe golden, one time per week when they can have sex.)  Estelle isn't wildabout the bar idea and even tries to spend them into bankruptcy at one pointso that Buddy will be forced to give it up.  She doesn't think much of Buddyor his pals, referring to them as ""a bunch of knuckleheads."" The initial complication to Buddy's big idea comes in the form of twotenants, an obnoxious lush, Jim O'Neary (Kevin Conway), and his verypregnant wife, Mary (Kelly MacDonald, TRAINSPOTTING), who refuse to vacatethe premises.  The arrival of their surprisingly half-black son breaks thislogjam, causing Jim to flee, never to be seen again.  This also makes Maryinto a social pariah, accorded status below that of a streetwalker. Buddy, taking pity on Mary, arranges for her to be a ""kept woman"" in asecret apartment.  They form a strong but strange bond in which she insistson calling him Mr. Visalo and prefers that he refer to her as Mrs. O'Neary.He cooks for her and confides in her, but their close relationship neverappears to go much beyond a few shared kisses.  She tries to help him cometo grips with his feelings, telling him that he shouldn't feel bad when hecries.  ""You're a broad,"" he replies in his typical, 50s macho vernacular.""You're supposed to cry.""   The film is narrated by her son as an adult, giving it an extra dose ofrealism.  One of the typical tales concerns Buddy and Estelle's ""legendaryfight"" about their entire 11 years of marriage that went on late into thenight. The film's lush score by Stephen Endelman matches perfectly the bright andhappy primary colors of Michael Mayers's cinematography.  The vintageautomobiles are so overly perfect that they are like a running joke.  Everycar is spotless and looks like it just left the dealer's showroom.  StatenIsland in the 50s must have been free of birds and rain. ""I've got talent! I could be somebody!""  Buddy screams at Estelle in linesreminiscent of Marlon Brando's famous ones.  Buddy is an everyman character,whose big dreams may never come true, but realizing his smaller ones mayprove just as satisfying. TWO FAMILY HOUSE runs 1:44.

897," ""Two Girls and a Guy,"" directed by James Toback (1987's ""The Pick-Up Artist""), is a three-character drama that is set entirely in the New York apartment of a struggling actor (Robert Downey Jr.), who comes home from a long trip to find that both of his girlfriends, Carla (Heather Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner), are there and have discovered that they both have been being played by him for the last ten months.  It is very difficult to make films like ""Two Girls and Guy,"" in which there only a few characters and all they do is talk. It can be done (1995's ""Before Sunrise""), but more often than not it comes off as being more appropriate as a play than an actual motion picture (1995's ""Oleanna""). The successfulness of such a film usually depends on the quality of the dialogue and performances, which is unfortunate since ""Two Girls and a Guy"" rarely has intelligent and provocative dialogue, and the performances are far from impressive.  One of the main problems with ""Two Girls and a Guy"" is that it is constantly confused by what type of genre it wants to fall in. Mostly it is a comedy, which is somewhat of a predicament considering the fact that the subject matter is very serious. And then in the end, nothing is really resolved, and the picture makes a sharp u-turn towards melodrama, which isn't touching, but just seems out of place.  Another flaw is in its characters, which are the type of people you are glad you don't know in real life, since they are both unpleasant and downright annoying. Like ""Oleanna,"" which equally grated on your nerves, it seemed like all of the dialogue was shouted at each other to the point of nausea, and I walked away from the movie with a literal headache. After seeing this film, I made a rule that in order to like a movie, it shouldn't be physically painful to watch.  ""Two Girls and a Guy"" is overdone in almost all senses of the word, and it is very messy. By not liking any of the characters, I didn't care about their problems or the outcome of them. I just wanted them to leave me alone. ",Two Girls and a Guy,R,1998,1.5
898,"""Two Weeks Notice"" is not only a conspiracy against theapostrophe: it is a formidable plot against the genre of witty,original and entertaining romantic comedy.  Formulaic as mostothers of the category in that the two people in love are keptpsychologically, if not physically apart until their inevitable unionat the conclusion, ""Two Weeks Notice"" is insipid enough that itdepends on Sandra Bullock's signature pratfalls to arouse(embarrassed) audience laughter.  Filmed in New York City, witha considerable number of shots in my own borough of Brooklyn,Marc Lawrence's film gives the Big Apple a rancid taste.     Given that the script is by Marc Lawrence, we'd not expect toomuch of this feature.  After all Mr. Lawrence's ""Miss Congeniality""was thoroughly predictable, though Michael Caine did what hecould to save the film from its disappointing script; and ""Forces ofNature"" was likewise a threadbare story despite the presence ofMs. Bullock and the excellent Ben Affleck.     Not even Hugh Grant can afford the film some class since, afterall (if I might borrow from critic David Thomson's article about theforty-year-old Londoner in ""The New Biographical Dictionary ofFilm""), ""That Hugh Grant gets away with it attests to the specialAmerican sentimentality for soft toffee in Brits...his successfulromantic comedies all give up the ghost before they're over, as ifsuccumbing to the itchy mannerisms that pass for acting inGrant.""     Directed with a sledgehammer hand by Marc Lawrence, whosescript includes one embarrassing toilet scene that could havebeen copied from the various adolescent comedies of late and afew pratfalls by Ms. Bullock, ""Two Weeks Notice"" is yourstandard anti-rich, anti-corporation story. Hugh Grant inhabits therole of George Wade, who together with his brother runs asuccessful corporate law practice that caters to real estatedevelopers.  When he hires the quirky, liberal Harvard Lawgraduate Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock), sparks flow in oppositedirections.  Both repress their mutual attraction while at the sametime  they argue politics throughout their relationship.  She isopposed to the tearing down of a community center in ConeyIsland to make way for a condo development while he believesthat the continued existence of the little building will cut intocorporate profits.       Who do you think will win?  Will Wade persuade Legal-Aid-ishKelson that developers have a right to tear down communitycenters in the interest of profits?  Will Lucy persuade George thatprofits must take a back-seat to the needs of the small people?  Ifyou don't know the answer to this, see the movie.  You'll enjoy.  Ifyou do know the answer and still pay your bucks to see Wadekeeping up his reputation as a playboy with the female lawyers onhis staff, such as the upwardly mobile June Carter (Alicia Kitt)while Kelson looks in horror at the amoral doings of the middle-aged man-about-town, this could also be your kind of movie.

899,"      Writer and director Victor Nunez's last film was the widelypraised but rarely seen RUBY IN PARADISE (1993).  His latest picture,ULEE'S GOLD, which stars Peter Fonda in an exquisite performance, seemsdestined to suffer the same fate.  An incredible, but understatedcharacter study, it has no special effects and the biggest surprise isthe way the story shuns all the popular movie cliches.       Quiet and withdrawn Vietnam veteran Ulee Jackson (Fonda) has thehonorable profession of beekeeper.  (""The bees and I have anunderstanding.  I take care of them, and they take care of me."")  PeterFonda, looking, sounding, and acting like his father Henry, gives thebest performance of his career -- an astounding piece of acting.  Acomplex character who slowly reveals his feelings, but always seems tohave even more bottled up inside.  From Ulee's troubled eyes down tothe methodical way he takes off his glasses, this character burns withsome inner rage.       Jaded viewers reading words like ""troubled Vietnam vet"" and ""rage""will probably have already finished the script in their minds, but theywill be wrong.  This is not a typical film.  Set in a working classarea of Florida, the fictional story has an authenticity that mostmovies only dream of.       Ulee takes care of his two grandkids, teenage Casey and 9-year-oldPenny, played by Jessica Biel and Vanessa Zima, since their fatherJimmy (Tom Wood) is in prison for robbery.  Ulee, who always refuseshelp from outsiders, does his best to raise the girls.  RebelliousCasey is almost more than he can handle.  ""You'll pay for the rest ofyour life for being a jackass,"" he warns her as she stomps out of thehouse.  ""Yeah, well, it's better than dying of boredom,"" she screamsback at him as she gets into her boyfriend's car.       Prominently featured in the film is the art of beekeeping.  Uleefinds solace in the serenity of the bees and satisfaction from the backbreaking work.  Whereas many shows lose it in the small details, Nunezknows how to get everything right.  When Ulee comes in after a hard daylifting the boxes, he takes a nap on the hardwood floor of the diningroom.  As he awakens, Virgil Mirano's careful camerawork shoots hisview looking up seeing the tablecloth and the light above and thusincreases the audience's empathy by showing exactly what Ulee's life islike.       Charles Engstrom's music manages to be melancholy without everbeing maudlin.  As a soft piano tune plays, you become one with thebees and the troubled hero.       One day, Ulee gets a call from Jimmy's two ex-partners in crime,Eddie Flowers (Steven Flynn) and Ferris Dooley (Dewey Weber).  Theyhave Jimmy's wife, Helen (Christine Dunford).  A druggie, she is in badshape, and they want Ulee to come and take her away.  And, they havesomething they need to tell Ulee.  What little narrative drive thischaracter study has will derive from that conversation, but do not bedistracted.  The show's bounteous rewards come from the character studyof Ulee.  The marvelous supporting cast serve mainly to help Uleereveal himself to us.       Ulee has the good fortune to have recently rented out his nearbycottage to a nurse he calls Miss Hope (Patricia Richardson), but sheasks him to call her Connie.  He tells her of his beloved wife who diedsix years ago.  ""Me, I'm divorced twice,"" she tells him.  ""No kidsfortunately.  I guess, fortunately.""  As with everything in thisrealistic story, their relationship moves in sometimes surprising waysand the dialog seems more natural than scripted.       The gripping story, which manages to be both intense and peaceful,eventually comes to a carefully orchestrated and satisfactoryconclusion.  Well, partially.  These characters, like good neighbors,are not the sort you like to lose. ",Ulee's Gold,R,1997,3

Jackson - inan unkempt Afro - who poses not only a bizarre explanation but alsotheorizes a purpose for the rest of Willis's life. ""I believe comicbooks are our last link to a form of history,"" he notes. Could,perhaps, Willis be a modern-day superhero? Willis's wide-eyed 12year-old son (Spencer Treat Clark, trying hard to be Haley JoelOsment) is easily convinced but not his estranged wife (a surprisinglyhaggard-looking Robin Wright Penn) who claims, ""I don't want violencein my life."" As for Willis, he's just not sure of anything except thathe's sad and that his world is crumbling around him - like the slow,stalemated story which has plot loopholes large enough to drive a citybus through. During the dark, creepy, climactic chase, where doesWillis, the wet, caped crusader, get dumped on a dreary, damp, rainynight? Underwater - and we've already been told that water is like hisKryptonite. ""Do you know what the scariest thing is?"" Jacksonconcludes during what passes for a twist ending. ""To not know yourplace in the world. Now we know who you are and we know who I am."" Onthe Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Unbreakable"" is an uncertain3. Ostensibly about heroes and villains, basically, it's unadulteratedpoppycock. Unfathomable is more like it. ",Unbreakable,PG-13,2000,2.5
901,"Under the Tuscan Sun"" evokes the power of an exquisite landscape whosevisual poeticism speaks louder than words every couldand for goodreason. Loosely based on the best-selling travelogue memoir of thesame name by Frances Mayes, the film has been jazzed up with a morecohesive narrative and conventional characters but its meatiest strengthremains the often unforgettable images. Some of them are predictablyof the Italian scenery, but others involve the incendiary framingof characters and inanimate objects. In fact, ""Under the Tuscan Sun""is so very beautiful and idyllic it's a shame its plotting doesn'thold such close scrutiny.   Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) is a 35-year-old San Francisco writerand book critic whose life is put into a tailspin when she discoversher husband has been having an affair. In an effort to help her getover the painful divorce, best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) gives hera ticket for a bus trip through Italysomething Frances cannot refuse.What Frances does not expect is that, on an impulse, she will endup purchasing a Tuscan home and not returning to the U.S. As she workson fixing the property up, Frances takes a spiritual journey thatleaves her reconsidering love, in the form of the suave Marcello (RaoulBova), and forming valuable relationships she otherwise would never have had.   Written and directed by Audrey Wells, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" hasa low-wattage plot that, in lesser hands, might have turned into acheesy Lifetime movie where Judith Light melodramatically picks herlife back up after she finds her lover cheating on her. While thispremise is intact, the film elegantly takes the high road, avoidingmaudlin emotions and developments at almost every turn in favor ofsomething more simple and naturalistic. In developing a book thathad very little of a basic storyline, however, Wells has trouble ingiving the proceedings a definitive backbone that demands viewer interest.After all, the centerpiece of the action involves little more thana house being repaired.   Thank goodness, then, for the perfectly tuned performances and cinematographyby Geoffrey Simpson (2000's ""Center Stage""). The Tuscan countrysideis breathtakingly rendered, its flower fields and silky valleys bathedin a heavenly golden sunlight. Other shots are not only ambitious,but lyrical, recalling the stupendous work of Federico Fellini. Onemoment, directly reminiscent of 1960's ""La Dolce Vita,"" places aging,free-spirited actress Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) in a fountain, tramplingaround in the water and invigorated by the freedom to do so. It isan exquisite scene in every respect. Simpler but no less memorableimages include a water faucet on the wall that never seems to work,and a single tear that falls from Patti's eye as she lays in bed and unloads her soul.   Fresh off her Oscar nomination for 2002's ""Unfaithful,"" Diane Laneunderstands Frances and seriously digs underneath this woman's skin,grit and all. When Frances' world suddenly changes, she has no ideahow to accept it and move on. At the same time, she is horrified ofher seemingly irrational decision to move to Tuscany. Lane bringsequal parts fear, warmth, desperation, and joy to a plum part andmakes it completely her own. Of note in supporting parts are the underratedSandra Oh (2002's ""Big Fat Liar""), brilliant in 1998's ""Last Night""and getting some sterling moments here, who gives her Patti a sureheadednessoffset by an unexpected vulnerability; and Lindsay Duncan (1999's""An Ideal Husband""), an unforced scene-stealer as the warmheartedKatherine, a wealthy actress who has more wisdom to offer Francesthan could ever meet the eye.   At its base, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is admirable for avoiding treaclyplot points and, save for a run-in with an out-of-control thunderstorm,shoots for realism within its every situation. Likewise, the actingis superlative. The film has the ability to be purely beautiful, butit approaches this feat only in spurts rather than consistently. Withouta constant forward motion in its plotting, the film lacks urgency.""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a first-class travelogue of sights and scenes;its whole, ultimately, is less than the sum of its parts. ",Under The Tuscan Sun,PG-13,2003,2.5

903,"A high-spirited, clever satire on present-day race relations and aspoof of the '70s Blaxploitation genre, ""Undercover Brother,"" directedby Spike's brother, Malcolm D. Lee (1999's ""The Best Man""), comesas an early-summer surprise. Moving at a clip pace and with a rib-ticklingjoke always around the corner, this franchise-ready comedy could verywell become the next ""Austin Powers."" Anton Jackson (Eddie Griffin) is a smooth-movin', Cadillac-showin',afro-sportin' black man right out of the '70s decade who crosses pathsone day with B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., an organization run by The Chief(Chi McBride), dedicated to racial equality, and always at odds withThe (White) Man and his evil henchman, Mr. Feathers (Chris Kattan).The Chief likes Anton's moves enough to offer him a position as UndercoverBrother at the organization, which also includes sassy Sistah Girl(Aunjanue Ellis), Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams), and ConspiracyBrother (Dave Chappelle), and sole white intern Lance (Neil Patrick Harris). Undercover Brother's first assignment goes as follows: In his pursuitfor white dominance, The Man has managed to brainwash a respectedblack Presidential candidate (Billy Dee Williams) into forgoing hispolitical career in favor of opening a fried chicken fast food restaurant.As Undercover Brother sets out to get to the bottom of this conspiracy,his mission is distracted with the appearance of Penelope Snow, a.k.a.White She-Devil (Denise Richards), hired by The Man and describedas ""black man's kryptonite"" to turn Undercover Brother into a mayonnaise-loving,khakis-wearing fool. Bearing an undeniable resemblance to ""Austin Powers,"" ""UndercoverBrother"" is a funnier and, overall, more successfully loopy romp.Based on an Internet cartoon, the title character is sprung to lifeby the giddily enjoyable Eddie Griffin (2002's ""The New Guy""). LikeMike Myers before him, Griffin's Undercover Brother is outlandish,to be sure, but also a downright lovable movie hero. Through a nonstopsea of hit-and-miss jokes (the jokes that hit are downright hysterical,while the jokes that miss fall completely flat), Eddie Griffin carriesthe entire movie on his shoulders, and he does it with energized aplomb. But what makes ""Undercover Brother"" more than just a forgettable comedyis its sharp-witted, non-preachy comment on black and white relationsand racial stereotypes, which the movie gleefully skewers. Writtenby John Ridley and Michael McClullers, the physical comedy is well-executedand the dialogue is often quote-worthy. The sheer audacity of thecentral premise--that a black politician gives up his career to starta fried chicken chain--avoids offending because white people are joyfullyspoofed just as much, if not more. Less original is the climax, whichheavily borrows from the 2000 screen adaptation of ""Charlie's Angels,""right down to a seaside mansion exploding, followed by a helicopter action sequence. In addition to Griffin, the cast has a grand time hamming things up.As Undercover Brother's feuding female companions, Aunjanue Ellis(2000's ""Men of Honor""), as Sistah Girl, and Denise Richards (2001's""Valentine""), as White She-Devil, turn out to be splendid comedicperformers in their own right. This is particularly surprising ofthe radiant Richards, whose acting talents have been questionablein the past. One of the picture's funniest set-pieces is a ruthlesscatfight between Ellis and Richards, in which they gradually get moreand more clothes ripped off of them before stumbling into a showertogether. As Mr. Feathers, a closeted lover of black culture, ChrisKattan (2001's ""Corky Romano"") is his usual standout self. Finally,Neil Patrick Harris (2000's ""The Next Best Thing""), as the only whiteman in the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., is a veritable hoot, stealing scenes left and right. It's rare that movie spoofs work well, and something along the linesof ""Undercover Brother"" could have just as easily failed miserably.Somehow, through Malcolm D. Lee's direction, the actors' positivecomic timing, and a screenplay that is admittedly very clever, everythinghas come together wonderfully. You may not think too deeply about""Undercover Brother"" once it's over, but you won't be able to denyhow much you laughed out loud.",Undercover Brother,PG-13,2002,2.5
904," If you're a reader of contemporary fiction, watching a film byDavid Gordon Green might remind you of just about any of thenovels of John Grisham, except that in ""Undertow,"" which Green made after carrying away a Best First Film award fromthe New York Film Critics' Circle with ""George Washington,""nobody bothers suing anyone. Gaining justice by one's ownhand is so much quicker and more redemptive.   Fratricide andpatricide both serve as the picture's melodramatic devices,though much of ""Undertow"" is naturalistic, as cinematographerTim Orr gives us a sharp sense of place in the rural south whereouthouses and a deficit of running water are de rigeuer even inthis 21st century.  Green tackles both a coming-of-age subgenre and,  thoughdiscussions about the Greek myth of Charon's ferrying people toHades, prepares us for a violent scene that could have comeout of the early pages of Genesis.  Young Jamie Bell is the primary focus of this venture in the roleof 16-year-old Chris, who lives in the woods with his dad, John(Dermot Mulroney), and is so discontent with the hard life of apig farmer that he commits petty annoyances.  In one suchinstance he breaks the window of his would-be girl friend, thusalienating the girl's father_from whom the barefoot lad runs soswiftly that he punctures his foot on a plank with a rusty nail andjust keeps on running, board, nail and all.  Chris's 10-year-oldbrother Tim (newcomer Devon Alan) is a sickly lad allegedlyafflicted with an ulcer, which the dull-minded kid treats by eatingpaint.  Throwing up becomes a major pastime for the boy.    When daddy John's brother Deel (Josh Lucas) shows up atwhat passes for John's home after serving some time in jail, hesignals soon enough that he's really after some rare Mexicancoins that John has hidden, prompting Deel to think of fratricidalrevenge_particularly since John also stole Deel's girl from himand made her his wife.  ""Undertow,"" then, is a blend of standard melodrama latched onto a naturalistic plot, the two styles living side by side not withcomplete comfort.  For the most part, ""Undertow"" is a chasemovie without car crashes, as we watch the 16-year-old and the10-year-old run frantically from Deel, who is about to do theboys no good considering that they witnessed the commissionof a crime.  As in any road movie, the principal characters runinto an assortment of characters, the childless black couple inparticular, who take the two in and giving them good food inreturn for work while passing on the story of their ownmisfortunes.  A good deal of the film consists of film-schooltricks with the camera, such as freeze-frame, shifting to black-and-white, and featuring one particular shot shown as anegative_not all of these choices being necessarily obvious. Director Green calls his pic a ""balls-to-the-wall"" thriller, but whilethe suspense builds up thanks in part to a reliably eeriesoundtrack from Philip Glass, the more interesting parts are alsothe least violent as we ponder some of the ways we ourselvesgot into trouble as youngsters and how we dealt with theconsequences. ",Undertow,R,2004,2.5
905,"As you watch the young stud played by Olivier Martinezchange Lane a few times during this slow-moving but earthydrama, you might think: aside from Lady Chatterley, Bovary, andHester Prynne, which gender do we usually think of when wethink of the moral crime of adultery?  I think of men, don't you? And yet, isn't it true that for every man who commits adultery, awoman has to be involved or am I being naive?  I suppose ifthe woman is unattached, so to speak, she is guilty at most ofhousebreaking.  In Adrian Lyne's new movie ""Unfaithful,"" theblame is squarely on the middle-aged wife, Connie Summer(Diane Lane), who not only has every material good she needsbut a handsome caring husband, Edward (Richard Gere) and anobedient and not overly cutesy eight-year-old son, Charlie (ErikPer Sullivan).  Edward not only provides her the time and spaceto get facials, to go to auctions, and pretty much wander abouttown by train or car, but appears to have done nothing towarrant her fatal attraction to the twenty-eight year oldManhattan resident, whose French accent, two-day-old beard,cool, chaotic Soho pad and long black hair probably rope  in thegals by the dozens.     Adrian Lyne is probably the best non-Gallic director for thisfare, having clocked in with such movies as ""9-1/2 Weeks""(considered too racy for Americans even as late as 1986 andwas cut prior to release) and ""Fatal Attraction,"" which prettymuch trashes a woman with an obsession for a guy.  Nor isClaude Chabrol a bad choice for role-model, as ""Unfaithful"" isitself loosely based on the French master's ""La femme infidele,""or ""Unfaithful Woman,"" about a steadfast husband (MichelBouquet) who would kill to save his marriage to his wife(Stephane Audran) and who upon discovering his wife'sdalliance is obsessed not only with seeking out the lover butwith sitting on the man's bed and drinking the man's liquor.  InLa femme infidele, the husband sleeps when his beautiful wifeoffers herself to him and therefore, in the opinion of some,deserves what he gets.  However in ""Unfaithful,"" Edward mayhave lost some of the passion he brought into his marriage toConnie eleven years earlier, but one could hardly picture himrefusing to respond to his wife's overtures.     The conceit of the story is that many woman, whether they admit it or not, would be subjects for seduction if theyspontaneously ran into guys who excite them.  Passion makesrisk-takers of us all.  When Connie and young Paul Martel(Olivier Martinez) meet cute on a bright and windy day inManhattan's chic Soho neighborhood, Paul invites the prettywoman to his spacious loft.  Intrigued as well by  the haphazardorder of hundreds of books without a proper home, an elevatorthat works when it feels like, and the memory, perhaps, of herown freer days when she lived in Manhattan rather than in heroverly tidy Westchester home, she succumbs to temptation. Foolishly she meets Paul not only in his apartment but in coffeehouses where she could very well meet people she or Paulknew. The tension mounts in a Hitchcockian vein, but not beforedirector Lyme treats us to scripters Alvin Sargent and WilliamBroyles, Jr.'s humorous meeting between Connie and two oldfriends, Tracy (Kate Burton) and Sally (Margaret Colin), in atrendy coffee house.     While Richard Gere goes through his role reliably, asexpected, the big surprise is Diane Lane who shows morebreadth here than she had exhibited in movies like ""A Walk onthe Moon,"" ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""The Glass House.""  Sheexhibits more of her perfect body than ever before though to behonest, the nudity hits us only in tantalizing segments.  Thescene that best shows what a great actress can do occurs onthe Metro-North as Ms. Lane's character is returning home froma tryst with Paul.  Reflecting on her first interval from middle-class morality, her face shows alternately joy and fear, freedomand guilt.  The wordless minutes that follow a sudden break withroutine evoke more about her characters than any words cando.     While Diane Lane's exceptional acting is reason enough tosee the film, the story itself breaks no new ground and like""Changing Lanes,"" winds up with a ludicrous, if open conclusion. This is probably targeted toward a middle-aged and olderaudience, mature enough to realize the enormous danger intowhich a woman puts herself and family when she allows herhormones to rule her reason. ",Unfaithful,R,2002,2.5
906," When critics are banned from a movie in advance of itsopening, you know there's a problem - in this case, more thanone. Back in 1992, ""Universal Soldier"" introduced hunky Jean-ClaudeVan Damme as Luc Deveraux, a Unisol, the recycled corpse of a soldierkilled in Vietnam whose military motto is ""Dying to Serve.""  At thestory's end, Luc was just beginning to perceive human feelings andcomprehend emotions. In this sequel, he's developed into a ""normal""human being - a bit stronger with bigger muscles and certainly abetter fighter. Now, Luc's a widower with a pre-teen daughter (KarisPaige Bryant). He serves as a technical expert on a new governmentproject preparing a stronger breed of soldier that is moresophisticated, agile, and intelligent. All goes well until thesoldiers' supercomputer, in the human form of Michael Jai White,develops a maniacal mind of its own. Then it's the Self-EvolvingThought Helix (acronym SETH) against Luc, whose only allies are HeidiSchanz, a tough-as-nails TV reporter, and Kiana Tom (ESPN fitnessguru) as his training buddy. So what happens when the Muscles fromBrussels faces off against an entire army of Unisols programmed tokill, kill, kill? Guess. Pow! Bam! Jab! Zap! Some of the plotabsurdities include a pit stop at a sleazy strip club, the only placewhere they can find an Internet connection to access a secretcode. Directed by Mic Rodgers, a former stunt coordinator,Jean-Claude's acting technique has not improved noticeably, nor hashis enunciation.

907,"      UNSTRUNG HEROES is the second theatrical movie that Diane Keatonhas directed.  Her long association with the great director Woody Allenshows in the movie as does her work as a black and white photographer,but UNSTRUNG HEROES has the Keaton's unique cinematographic stamp onit.  Unfortunately I did not like it for reasons I will get into later,but at least she was not afraid to take risks and have characters thatwere constantly on the fringe.       UNSTRUNG HEROES is the story of Steven Lidz (Nathan Watt) and hiscrazy family.  Some of his family is seriously mentally ill whereasothers are merely quirky.  On a zaniness scale, the movie is off thechart.  Steven's dad, Sid (John Turturro), is a scientist and inventora la Doctor Emmett Brown in BACK TO THE FUTURE.  He invents one bizarrehomemade device after another without any visible interest incommercializing any of them.       In fact the major problem of the show is that it is not founded inreality.  Craziness works best when it comes from a plausible base.  Iam a big fan of oddball characters in movies from HAROLD AND MAUDE toPULP FICTION, but they work because the characters were believable.Writers Elizabeth Barton and Richard LaGravenese craft characters whoseonly interest comes in the unbelievably ridiculous things they do.Moreover, although some lines are funny, most fall flat.  They give Sidsuch unfunny lines as ""Everything can be broken down to numbers.Science will be earth's salvation.""       Steven's mother Selma (Andie MacDowell) is dying, but Sid tries tohide it from the Steven and his sister Sandy (Kendra Krull).  WhenSteven finds out, he escapes the pain of seeing his mother die and goesto live with his mentally ill uncles, Uncle Danny (Michael Richards)and Uncle Arthur (Maury Chaykin).  His uncles live in an apartment withold newspapers stacked to the ceiling so they can barely get around.Their closets are filled with balls of all sizes which they bounce offof each other's heads during meals.  Uncle Arthur believes that Nazisare spying on him all of the time.  He says that the slogan ""I like Ikeis a secret gentile code for I hate kikes."" He runs into rooms shuttingall of the windows because people in gray coats are chasing him.  Thetwo uncles grated on my nerves so much that I want to scream every timethey were on the screen, which regrettably is a lot.  The uncles tellSteven such wisdom as ""There are only eight trustworthy people in theentire world.  There were twelve, but four were assassinated.""       For me the saving grace of the movie was the impressive acting bytwelve year old Nathan Watt.  His ability to look so forlorn and todeliver deep feelings without speaking was the only outstanding part ofthe movie.  He was so good that I would not be surprised to see him getsome supporting actor award nominations.  Too bad he was in such a messof a movie.       There is one other memorable aspect of Unstrung Heroes - thecinematography by Phedon Papamichael.  The movie is set in the early60s, and the colors made you believe that they shot it with the oldover saturated film of that era.  I found the sets by Garreth Stoverdepressing, but they were imaginative especially the outlandishfurnishing of the Uncles' apartment.       John Turturro is one of those actors who suffers from terminaloveracting unless the director keeps him in constant check.  Here hegoes overboard as usual.  Andie MacDowell is an inconsistent actress.Sometimes, as in SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE, GROUNDHOG DAY, and FOURWEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, she is terrific.  In other movies, she stays onautopilot.  Here she was essentially forgettable.       UNSTRUNG HEROES runs only 1:33, but I still wish Lisa Churgin hadedited out the Uncles in their entirety.  The movie is correctly ratedPG.  It would not harm anyone, but I can not imagine anyone under 10having any interest in the movie.  I found UNSTRUNG HEROES to be a bigdisappointment and a movie that grated on my nerves way too often so Ican not recommend it.  I award it * for Nathan Watt's performance. ",Unstrung Heroes,PG,1995,1
908,"      Director Jon Avnet's UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL is a movie, a laBROADCAST NEWS, about news anchors that want to be rising stars.  Itstarts off as a romantic comedy and evolves into a romantic drama.  Asa comedy, it is superb with a bright script by Joan Didion and JohnGregory Dunne.  As a romance, it partially works but with stars thisbeautiful and charismatic, I would rate the romantic angle as a majordisappointment.  Based on the trailers for the movie which makes thedrama look contrived and silly, I was surprised at how chillinglyeffective the dramatic last quarter of the film is.       As the show starts, a famous Tally Atwater (Michelle Pfeiffer) isdelivering a speech reminding her fellow newscasters that, ""What we inthe news business can never forget is that we are only as good as thestories we tell.""  From there it flashes back to her story and how shetalked her way into the news business with a promo tape where she says""I am Sally, and I going to be a star.""       The only station news director that would hire her is WarrenJustice (Robert Redford) of WMIA in Miami.  After making her do thenewsroom equivalent of months of cleaning the latrines, he finally letsher have a crack in front of the camera doing the weather.  He changesher name dynamically to Tally during the broadcast since he decidesTally is a better choice than Sally.  Tally is a disaster doing theweather, but Warren sees greatness in her since ""she eats the lens,"" sohe gives her a job as a reporter.       I should point out that although the banter between the two ofthem is funny, in reality he would be facing a multimillion dollarsexual harassment lawsuit for what he says to her.  Actually, therelationship kept reminding me of Holly Hunter and William Hurt inBROADCAST NEWS, but everything in BROADCAST NEWS was better which isnot surprising since I rated BROADCAST NEWS as the best movie of theentire decade of the 1980s.       The news anchor at WMIA, Rob Sullivan (Scott Bryce), thinks he isGod's gift to women.  He calls himself Uncle Rob to them, and Tallyloathes him.  She even sprays her private space with perfume when heleaves.  Rob explains his news philosophy as, ""some of the people inthis business get jaded because it's the same awful stories, and it isthe same awful stories.  It just happens to different people.""       Both of the leads are quite good at their parts and have great funmaking the movie.  Pfeiffer gets to belt out her rendition of ""To reachthe unreachable star"" on the fifty yard line of an empty stadium whileRedford listens high up in the stands.  Other than it would be fun todo, there seems little purpose in including the scene in the final cut.       The movie is pure formula from the beginning to the highlymanipulative and telegraphed way in advance ending.  After she becomesa reporter, she rises to coanchor the news with ""Uncle Rob"".  She hateshim, and in one of the funnier sequences, they have an on the airverbal war.  This happens while they are smiling ear-to-ear with thecredits rolling and the newsroom mikes muted.  Later talking about Rob,she tells Warren that, ""he's so stupid!"", to which Warren retorts,""he's an anchorman.""       Tally wants to be a comer so she enlists the help of superagentBucky Terranova (Joe Mantegna).  Bucky tells her, ""Your voice is fullof money.""  He moves her to Philadelphia which is a bigger mediamarket, but she has to compete with Marcia McGrath (Stockard Channing)for the anchor slot, and Marcia thinks she is an old pro and anupper-class intellectual while Tally is just a young kid from thesticks who doesn't have a clue.  Marcia tells Tally, ""You get to be 42;you know what it takes to jump off the high board.""  Later Marshaadmits that, gasp, she is actually 44.       There is a subplot of how Warren has gotten such a bad reputationthat no one will hire him.  I found this part of the script more of adiversion and only mildly interesting at that.  Eventually, Pfeiffertells him that living with him is not good enough and that she wants toget married.  She explains, ""I want you around in the morning.""  Helooks bewildered and replies, ""You already have me around in themorning.  How, I have no idea.""  In the perfect retort line, she says,""I want you legally to be required to be there.""  She does thisbeautifully with her chin resting on her hands, and this is the onlytime I found her love for him convincing.       Although you probably saw it in the trailers, I will not revealthe drama that wraps up the film.  Suffice it to say that it shows howa remote television control booth can be a hotbed of excitement.Redford is at his best in these scenes.       The ending of the show contains a tearjerker that probably testedwell, but is so easy to predict and so formulaic that I hated it.There is one great scene toward the end of the show when, after hours,she tries out the network newsdesk for the first time.  She fondles themarble desk and gives an expression of total rapture.  Indeed, she hascome to the promised land.       One footnote.  Alanna Nash's biography of Jessica Savitch titled""Golden Girl"" is listed as the ""inspiration"" for the movie.  I readthat they were originally going to make the book into a movie but aftera dozen rewrites, they kept Savitch's blond hair, but nothing else fromthe book.       UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL runs a little long at 2:03.  It is ratedPG-13 for a little bad language and a little violence.  There is no sexor nudity.  Actually I would have preferred a little more romanticaction from the stars.  Certainly their love making which consists oflittle more than a few lame kisses is not convincing.  I think themovie as constructed would be fine for any kid over say 8, but I thinkthey might need to be a little older to be interested.  I recommendthis funny show to you, and I give it ***. ",Up Close and Personal,PG-13,1996,3

Ray, a snooty hypochondriac forced to take care of herselfbecause of parental neg lect from her music executive mother (HeatherLocklear), at first is cautious of letting Molly get close to her.But since Molly is an adult who has never truly grown up, and Rayis a child who has been forced to grow up way too fast, they forma close friendship that allows both parties to see what they havebeen missing out of life. ""Uptown Girls"" is a fantasy set in the real world, a fact that viewerswill need to remember if they plan on buying all of its leaps in plausibilityand overall sugarcoated emotions. Directed by Boaz Yakin (2000's ""Rememberthe Titans""), the film shouldn't work, and doesn't for close to itsfirst half-hour, but it eventually finds its footing and seeminglygrows more thoughtful and true to human nature with each passing minute. The opening act is not promising as it introduces pampered heroineMolly Gunn, a young woman characterized as too naive for her own good.Tak ing home her latest crush, a handsome aspiring singer named Neal,they spend a wonderful night together bonding and talking. The nextmorning, she is on the phone with her friend, Ingrid (Marley Shelton),pleading for her to help kick him out of her apartment. In the nextscene, when he decides to leave, she is crushed and begs him to stay.Molly's abrupt change in feelings about Neal is never explained, andsuggests that she has some sort of multiple personality disorder,a notion that is never brought up again. The proceedings go uphill with the introduction of Molly's job asRay's nanny. As sparklingly and just a little frighteningly playedby Dakota Fanning (2001's ""I Am Sam""), Ray is a force to be reckonedwith, one of the most adult children ever captured in a feature film.As Molly breaks down the germ-obsessed Ray's closed-in barriers andgets her to open up, it becomes clear that Ray is nothing if not as cared and lonely little girl who has been treated as a burden allher life. 9-year-old Fanning has the comic timing and emotional complexityof an actor three times her young age. In short, her every momentis alive in ways the rest of the film never quite attains. This is not to slight Brittany Murphy (2003's ""Just Married""), anoffbeat, one-of-a-kind talent who has finally been given her firstmotion picture to headline solo. It is from the point of view of Murphy'sMolly Gunn that the story is told from, and the actress excels atgiving her flighty character the depth and heart needed to make hermore than a caricature. Despite their 14-year age different, bothMolly and Ray are virtually parentless lost souls who have been shelteredfrom the world around them, something that allows them to believablybecome best friends. Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning make for awinning combination, and their character s' sometimes dark journeysdo not always take the most obvious route to the inevitable happy ending. The centerpiece of ""Uptown Girls""that of Molly and Ray's friendshipisso good that the movie gets bogged down every time the supportingcharacters enter the scene. The romance between Molly and Neal holdsno heat or chemistry, two vital aspects that would have made Molly'sheartbreak more palpable when she learns who Neal really is. Likewise,a subplot between Molly and Ingrid is nothing but irritating fillerbecause Ingrid has been written (from a screenplay by Julia Dahl,Mo Ogrodnik, Lisa Davidowitz and Allison Jacobs) for no reason asoverly uptight. Marley Shelton (2001's ""Valentine""), a capable enoughperformer, is never given the chance to let loose or become sympatheticas Ingrid. As for Ray's mother, she is hardly even there, which maybe half the point. Heather Locklear shows a promis e with her characterthat never comes to fruition because her subplot with daughter Ray is so underwritten. ""Uptown Girls"" is flawed and jagged around the edges, but at its baseare two wonderful performances from Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning,and two characters who are true originals. The final scene, whichwould not be believable in an ordinary picture but is a perfect capperto the film's fantasy origins, is absolutely charming because it staystrue to Molly and Ray, giving them the upbeat denouement they deservewithout tying everything together in a too-neat package. ""Uptown Girls""is Murphy and Fanning's show all the way, and they sell it.",Uptown Girls,PG-13,2003,1.5
910,"There could be worse„far worse„ways for the big, special effects-ladensummer movie season to begin than ""Van Helsing."" Like 1999's mediocre""The Mumm y"" and 2001's just as bad ""The Mummy Returns."" What do allthree films have in common? Writer-director Stephen Sommers, an excessivelymainstream moviemaker who never met a CGI shot or badly-timed bitof comic relief he didn't like. ""Van Helsing"" falls victim to thesesame hindrances, but this time it sort of works in spite of its bombastic,overblown nature. Whereas ""The Mummy"" pictures were boring and tediousin the most wearisome of popcorn flick ways, ""Van Helsing"" is likea rollercoaster ride that doesn't want to stop, and thank goodness.It's a 125-minute, third act-style climax, a fantasy-action pic sofast-paced and visually dazzling that it eventually wears you intosubmission. Yes, it's junk, and the screenplay is an unbelievablemess, and the one-liners and pratfalls are inappropriate and desperatelyunfunny, but it remains a solid entertainment while it lasts. With the character of the Mummy ha ving worn out his welcome, directorSommers turns his attention to the other classic Universal monsters,piling them one after the other into a boiling pot and stirring vigorously.The title character, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), reimagined from BramStoker's ""Dracula"" as a younger, more suave hero, is a brim-hattedvampire hunter questioning the reason behind what has become his life'swork. A sufferer of memory loss, he is assured that if he travelsto the dank European country of Transylvania to kill Dracula (RichardRoxburgh), vampiric son of Satan, his past will be revealed. Oncethere, Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the lastsurviving memory of her family's lineage who hasn't fallen victimto Dracula and his three vicious vampire brides (Elena Anaya, SilviaColloca, Josie Maran). With the villagers living in constant fear,Van Helsing teams up with Anna to find a way to not only kill Dracula,but also the Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley),w ho turns out to not be the dangerous creature they expected. Combining all of the main classic movie monsters into one big-budgetvisual-effects extravaganza is filled with boundless possibilities,but Stephen Sommers' screenplay pays no attention to whether sucha premise makes sense or not. He doesn't care much about the characters,either, and the rare moments where he attempts to give them expositionand development are laughably amateurish (Anna's wistful, out-of-the-bluecomment about never having seen the ocean is so random it inspiresunintended giggles). Fortunately, dialogue is sparse in a motion picturethat only cares about one thing„cutting to the chase. ""Van Helsing""breathlessly jumps from one gigantic action set-piece to the next,from beginning to end, and nary a shot goes by that isn't jam-packedwith awe-inspiring computer-generated backdrops and less impressive,but still entertaining computer-generated creatures. There are times,in fact, where it seem s one is watching an animated film that justso happens to have some live-action actors mixed in. The opening sequence, a gloriously rich and stylish black-and-whiteode to the classic 1930's Universal monster pictures that documentsthe creation of Frankenstein's monster and Dr. Frankenstein's fierydeath at the hands of the frightened townspeople, is deceptive. Sostunningly beautiful and atmospheric is this eye-catching prologuethat it comes as a disappointment when the frames become colorizedand the film transforms into just another conventional blockbusterwannabe where plot, characters, and plausibility take a back seatto the magic of modern computer technology. Plausibility, in fact, is nonexistent. Human characters clearly withoutsuperhero powers jump through windows, swing across ravines, and suffergiant falls, only to land on their feet and continue battle withouteven the faintest of injuries. In a too-obvious bid for the sacredPG-13 rating, the naked, winged vampire brides lack nipples on theirbreasts and are androgynous down below, and when they turn back intonormal-looking women, clothes magically appear on them. Who knew vampireshad the power to make clothes disappear and reappear at whim? Andhow convenient for the werewolves to tear off all their human clothesfollowing a transformation, only to still have on underwear when theyturn back into men. It may be nitpicking, but such criticisms arevalid when a film's content is so cheaply jeopardized in favor of an MPAA rating. As the brooding, butt-kicking Van Helsing, Hugh Jackman exudes noneof the charisma he showed as Wolverine in 2000's ""X-Men"" and 2003's""X2."" As Anna, Kate Beckinsale (2003's ""Underworld"") is better, capablyhandling a tricky European accent„and one that sound ed hideous inthe trailers, no less„while fitting the bill as Van Helsing's toughfemale companion and possible love interest. Her's is the only performancethat really works, save for the creepy vampire brides whose menacingcackle indelibly reminds of the possessed women in Sam Raimi's ""TheEvil Dead."" Richard Roxburgh (2003's ""The League of ExtraordinaryGentlemen"") is embarrassingly bad as Count Dracula, and threatensto sink his every scene with over-the-top histrionics. With so much stacked against it, there is no good reason why ""VanHelsing"" should work as well as it ultimately does. Still, the filmis a masterpiece of mood and visual inspiration, decked to the nine'swith awesome gothic art direction and production design, and stunningsettings that spring to life, prove just how advanced today's CGIeffects have become. The action sequences, which take up most of thefilm, are exuberantly shot and ed ited, none more so than the attackof the vampire brides on the horse-and-carriage as it made its waythrough the gloomy, foreboding woods. And the relentless, poundingmusic score by Alan Silvestri (2003's ""Identity"") keeps the energyhigh when it could have easily become exhausting. Make no bones about it, ""Van Helsing"" is as far-fetched as moviescome, but then, what else could be expected from a film that featuresDracula, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Wolfman, evilmidget minions, thousands of attacking baby vampires, and three fangedbabes who fly around the sky. If you walk into ""Van Helsing"" readyto scrutinize its plot particulars, savor its dialogue, and get involvedin three-dimensional characters, writer-director Stephen Sommers makesit clear from the beginning that you are barking up the wrong tree.Instead, ""Van Helsing"" is a likable piece of sensory overload, disposableeye candy that entertains while it plays itself out but isn't worthmuch once it's over. The film's sole ingenious line of dialogue comesat the end, so clever it is almost as if it fell into the screenplayby accident. ""What do you say about your blood coursing through mybody?"" one of the vampire brides asks Anna. Anna's reply, after impalingher with a stake: ""I say if you're gonna kill them, kill them. Don'tjust stand there and talk about it.""",Van Helsing,PG-13,2004,2
911,"Is the world ready for a horribly disfigured Tom Cruise?  Well, if GwynethPaltrow's fans accepted her in a 300-pound fat suit in SHALLOW HAL, thenCruise with a terribly mangled face shouldn't be that much of a problem.VANILLA SKY's convoluted script and meandering direction, both by CameronCrowe (JERRY MAGUIRE and ALMOST FAMOUS), are where the troubles lie.  Amurky thriller, the movie is based on the Spanish film OPEN YOUR EYES, whichwe are constantly reminded of by Sofia Serrano (Pen_lope Cruz), whosefavorite phrase is ""open your eyes.""  Cruz starred in the original film aswell. In a story in which dreams and reality are constantly intermixed, fabulouslywealthy David Aames (Tom Cruise) wakes to a New York City day in which thewhole town has decided to sleep in.  It's nine o'clock in the morning, andno one's there, not even in perpetually populated Times Square.  This timeit's easy to guess that it's a dream, most other times aren't.  (Imagine thedifficulties of filming this scene in which there isn't anyone stirring, noteven a mouse.  It must have been a Herculean logistical effort.) David, who's fighting a raging battle against the ""Seven Dwarfs,"" his boardof directors, inherited all of his money from his media baron father.  Hisfather's best selling book starts out: ""The answer to ninety-nine out of onehundred questions in the world is 'money.'"" David's trophy girlfriend, who really isn't a girlfriend at all but a greatsex buddy, is a beautiful blonde named Julie, who is played in an Oscarworthy supporting role by Cameron Diaz.  Although David thinks theirstrictly sexual relationship is hunky-dory, Julie wants something more.   Another delightful supporting performance is given by the ever reliableJason Lee as David's best bud, Brian Shelby.  His sharp wit is best seen ina near death event that they survive without a scratch.  ""We were almostdead there, and you know what happened?  Your life flashed in front of me,""Brian tells David. One day, into David's life comes Sofia, whom Julie ridicules by calling hera ""moth"" and who David believes is the ""last guileless girl in New York.""Pen_lope Cruz proves again, as she did in CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN and ahalf dozen other recent films, that she is a wonderfully sweet woman with agreat smile who just can't act. After this setup, the labyrinthine plot goes on and on.  It's the sort ofmovie that, if you watch it on video, will probably have you leaving to dohousework while asking your spouse to give you a call when something finallyhappens. The great science fiction ending, which pulls a wildly improbableexplanation almost out of thin air, and Diaz's terrific performance almostmake the movie worth it's long running time.  Someone should buy Crowe apair of scissors.  I'd love to see a much shorter director's cut. VANILLA SKY runs 2:20.

912,"Nature Boy,"" one of the great hit songs of the 1940's featuredat the beginning of Joseph Losey's movie ""The Boy With GreenHair,"" has this trite but true moral: ""The greatest thing/ You'll everlearn/ Is just to love/ And be loved in return."" This sentiment,seconded by the filthy rich Lord Steyne, forms a leading conceitin the lavish costume drama ""Vanity Fair"" directed by Mira Nair(""Monsoon Wedding,"" ""Salaam Bombay""). Within its generousone hundred thirty-five minutes, ""Vanity Fair,"" adapted byMatthew Fault, Mark Skeet, and Julian Fellowes from WilliamMakepeace Thackery's 19th century novel of the same name,evokes the theme of social climbing as well as that of love. Wecan see how easily the novel and, by extension, this successfuladaptation, is a classic: its themes are universal since, after all,aside from the anomalous 1960's and early seventies in America,social climbing has been our favorite sport. While ourConstitution forbids titles of nobility and while we in the U.S. treatany mention of social strata as ""class warfare,"" the poor strive towin the lottery and the middle class to amass great quantities oftoys, while the doyens of New Money dabble in the game ofrising to our own copy of European nobility called Society.The film, like the Thackeray novel, is anchored by BeckySharp, here played with considerable depth by ReeseWitherspoon. In the process of climbing the social ladder from apenniless orphan to governess and then, by marriage to thedashing soldier Rawdon Crawley (James Purefoy) and patronagefrom the wealthy but lovelorn Steyne, she mixes howevertentatively with the great lords and ladies of London, Hampshireand points between. The story opens near the turn of the 19th century on Rebeccapainter and now deceased French mother who, when orphaned,is educated by Miss Pinkerton's Academy. Though Becky learnsFrench and social graces, she feels an emotional gap due to thelack of kindness of any of her teachers and longs for a better lifethan her birthright would ordinarily allow. As a governess inHampshire to the children of the eccentric Sir Pitt Crawley (BobHoskins), she impresses rich aunt Matilda (Eileen Atkins), whoinvites her to move with her to London, once again meeting herchildhood friend Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai). When Beckymarries handsome heir Rawdon Crawley, she and her newhusband are cast out by Matilda. Having served in the waragainst Napoleon, Rawdon returns to a home without money. However Becky has long benefitted from the patronage of LordSteyne (Gabriel Byrne), a gentleman who, charmed by Beckyfrom the time the latter was an eight-year-old girl, continues tofunnel money her way to the consternation of Becky's husband.Thackeray subtitled ""Vanity Fair"" ""A Novel Without a Hero."" By virtue of Reese Witherspoon's fine performance as the film'sanchor, we see that virtually no one in her circle is without flaws. However likable Becky may be to her admirers such as herhusband, Matilda (before the marriage), and the MarquessSteyne, she combines intelligence and beauty with self-centeredness and grasping. What Ms. Witherspoon fails toconvey adequately, however, is one major point made by thenovel: that Becky stands apart from the society she embracesbecause she sees the humor and ridiculousness of the men andwomen of a middle-class England where pride, wealth andambition are the leading virtues.   The world that director Nair depicts is not quite the same asthat shown by Roger Michell in his 1995 adaptation of the JaneAusten novel of the same time period ""Persuasion,"" wherein ayoung woman has never recovered from her break with adashing sailor. That understated film evokes a society withrelations so repressed that the mere touch by a man of awoman's hand could cause quivers of joy and confusion in thehearts of both. By contrast, Nair's movie depicts an amplenumber of attempted seductions and hints of affairs: in fact, inone situation, Becky, trying to ward off an aggressive advance byher benefactor, Steyne, is caught in the act of embrace byBecky's husband. Understated could hardly be the term to describe this film, shotby Declan Quinn principally in the south of England most notablythe city of Bath, and in India. Under the bright sun, India, colorfulto a fault in free-flowing costumes and exotic music, supplies agraphic contrast to the drab country on the other side of theworld, portraying a culture so different and relaxed whencompared with the mother country that we do not wonder atBecky's ultimate ambition to join yet another man in his voyage tothe Southern Asian country. Mira Nair does add a contemporary touch that Thackeray couldnot have considered, leading us to wonder whether we couldjudge Witherspoon's Becky to be a feminist. Surely she is notthe withering flower that describes her best friend, AmeliaSedley) who, for reasons unknown was able to attract a husbandin George Osborne (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers)--who desires her somuch that he is willing to sacrifice a potential inheritance from hiswealthy father (Jim Broadbent). At Witherspoon portrays her,Becky is ambitious enough, willing to work for her keep, doing aterrific job as governess-teacher to children but unable to makethe kind of life of which she dreams or the equality she seekswith the lords and ladies of her country. She makes us in theaudience realize that there's a thin line between unscrupulousgrasping and praiseworthy ambition and, indeed, she may havemarried Rawdon Crawley for money and position but when thechips are down, she tearfully and convincingly conveys her lovefor the brave and dashing soldier.   Because the thick novel, with dozens of characters, is whittleddown for cinematic portrayal, there's much we can't see, forexample, Miss Pinkerton, the snobbish mistress of the academyfor girls at which Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp meet, dislikesBecky intensely. Miss Swartz, the rich wooly-haired student atMiss Pinkerton's School, pays double tuition because of herimmense wealth, but we see her only briefly when the Crawleyfamily tries to marry off Rawdon to her. And where is JohnSedley, Amelia's father, a middle-class English merchant ofgrasping, selfish ways who is forced to move from RussellSquare to a cottage kept by Clapps, a former servant of theSedleys? Hopefully the film will encourage a new audience for the 19thcentury novel, filled with the sort of social climbing that informedthe 1980's in America. This ""Vanity Fair"" does a handsome jobin portraying people who are not good, who are not meant to begood, but who may realize that goodness often goes hand inhand with stupidity and that cleverness is often knavery. ",Vanity Fair,PG-13,2004,3
913,"     VANYA ON 42ND STREET comes from a unique idea.  Andre Gregory (fromMy Dinner With Andre fame) has for years been gathering actor andactress friends of his to do the Anton Chekhov play UNCLE VANYA for funat an off-Broadway theater.  They invite a dozen of their friends towatch it and they do the play, sans costumes, just for the sheerenjoyment of acting.       Louis Malle heard of this and decided to film and direct one ofthese gatherings.  The play was updated (read modernized) by the greatcontemporary playwright, David Mamet.  You may remember Mamet from manyof his well written movies--my favorites being HOUSE OF GAMES (1987)and THINGS CHANGE (1988).  His staccato style of terse, biting, andthought provoking dialog is unrivaled.  (Okay, it is sort of likeHarold Pinter, but Pinter is so depressing).       The show starts with the people coming slowly in off of 42ndStreet to the old Shubert Theater which is mainly in ruins now.  AndreGregory has a small speaking role as the leader of the audience of adozen friends.  Out of no where the play begins.  It is as if they hadcome to your old house and were putting on a play just for you in yourliving room.       In the play Uncle Vanya is played with great gusto by WallaceShawn (the other person in MY DINNER WITH ANDRE).  He is a Russianliving at the family's country estate with his niece (Brooke Smith) whois madly in love with the country doctor (Larry Pine) who visits almostevery day.  Sad to say the love is not mutual.  Also on the estate isthe niece's Father--a professor and his new wife, Yelena (beautifullyplayed by Jullianne Moore as a classic flirt).  There are several otheractors and actresses with important parts in the play.  All did awonderful job, but for me it was Shawn and Moore that really stood outas giving terrific performances.       In the play, Vanya is very sad because he has worked hard all ofhis life, and he thinks that at the age of 47 he is now too old to beof interest to women.  (47--imagine that!) He is head over heels inlove with the professor's wife--his sister having died before the playstarts and the professor having married Yelena.  Yelena flirtsintensively with Vanya.  Watch the camera angles which intensifiestheir close face-to-face flirting.  It turns out however that Yelenaindeed does not find Vanya at all attractive--just as he feared.       Yelena, on the other hand, confides in a great woman-to-woman talkfest with her stepsister that she thought she loved the professor whenshe married him but now realizes that she did not love him then andcertainly does not love him now, and yet, she can not leave him.  Sheconfesses that she is terribly unhappy with her life.       The play is one great scene after another.  I do not remember theoriginal UNCLE VANYA so I can not say for sure how much Mamet modifiedit, but I suspect a fair amount.  Whatever.  I found the dialog fairlyperfect as presented in this movie. ",Vanya on 42nd Street,PG,1994,3.5
914,"  I must confess that I am vertically challenged, meaning thatwhen I peer down a deep crevasse, my palms get sweaty and my knees goweak. So, despite its inherent implausibility, this suspensefulexcursion into mountain-climbing had my heart pounding - but it wasmore my acrophobia than the cliffhanger by writers Robert King andTerry Hayes and director Martin Campbell (""The Mask ofZorro""). Lifting liberally from ""K2,"" ""Wages of Fear"" and the IMAXfilm ""Everest,"" the story begins with high drama on a cliff in Moab,Utah, where Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) and sister Annie (RobinTunney) survive a rock-climbing accident that costs the life of theirfather (Stuart Wilson). Flash forward several years: Peter has tradedhis carabiners for cameras, photographing snow leopards in theHimalayas for National Geographic, while Annie, now a hotshotmountaineer, has joined with another expert (Nicholas Lea) to leadElliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton), a millionaire entrepreneur - thinkRichard Branson, to the summit of the world's second highest peak, acommercial stunt perfectly timed coincide with a fly-over of a planefrom his new airline. But when they're trapped in a cavern by anavalanche with just 36 hours to live, Peter assembles his own motleyteam, led by a Jeremiah Johnson-like recluse (Scott Glenn), to lugcanisters of nitroglycerin up to blast through and rescue them.  The outdoor scenes are quite realistic and cinematically spectacular,but the stereotypical characterizations are mundane and mediocre. On theGranger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Vertical Limit"" is a dizzying 6.

915," ""Very Bad Things,"" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year, a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that I couldn't help but be won over by the material.  The film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in Los Angeles for a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The groom-to-be is Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau), who is about to be married to the controlling, wedding-obsessed Laura (Cameron Diaz). The other friends are real estate agent Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), quiet Charles (Leland Orser), and brothers, Michael (Jeremy Piven) and family man Adam (Daniel Stern). After a wild night of gambling, boozing, and drugs, a stripper (Carla Scott) who was paid for by Robert comes into their hotel room, but after a freak accident, to everyone's terror, she is killed. As Robert puts it: ""There are two options: go to the police and go to prison, or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her."" After a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body, Robert is forced to kill him as well. ""Okay, there is only one option now. You can forget about calling the police,"" he says. By the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer, most of them are overcome with guilt, which sets off an even more elaborate series of event, that includes much, much more murder, double-crosses, and the inevitable wedding from hell.  ""Very Bad Things,"" which is actor Peter Berg's feature film directing debut, is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that, ""There's Something About Mary,"" wanted to be. It pulls out all the stops to create something fresh, original, and hilarious, even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence, gore, and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end.   The screenplay, also written by Berg, is, to put it mildly, very funny and courageous. During the second act of the film, some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death, which was beginning to undermine the humor, but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed. The dialogue is edgy and inventive, and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable. There's more fun, I think, in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts.  Cameron Diaz gives her best performance to date here, and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful Laura, who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends. Diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that I really do think she deserves a supporting actress Oscar nomination come next January. By the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger, and reciting lines like, ""stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs,"" I couldn't help but crack up at how ""balls-to-the-wall"" this film had become. Jeanne Tripplehorn creates another character original, as Daniel Stern's wife, who late in the picture, we discover, is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with.   It is at this level that, ""Very Bad Things,"" was so entertaining and surprising. Just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen, there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky. The last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top. Although I enjoyed the film immensely, let me make this clear: ""Very Bad Things,"" is not a movie for everyone. It is more tasteless than anything I have ever seen, it is more violent and bloody than a R-rated film usually is, and it is offensive. Luckily, these are elements that I would prefer in a comedy, since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred, politically incorrect comedy. The fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and ""safe"" wide-releases coming out lately, still gives me hope for the Hollywood film industry. ",Very Bad Things,R,1998,2.5

Rumor has it that she was paid $10-million by Miramaxto star, which is a valid enough explanation, but how was the lame,sitcom-level screenplay by Eric Wald even greenlit in the first place?Every aspect of ""View From the Top"" hints--no, make that screams--ofdesperation, right down to the wall-to-wall, cover-heavy '80s soundtrackthat doesn't even feature the original recordings. Ever since Donna Jensen (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a young child, she hasvowed to break out of her unhappy trailer-park existence in SilverSprings, Nevada, and make something of herself.

With attractive trips to Paris and New Yorkat her fingertips, Donna must now decide what will make her happier:a profession she has dreamed of having, or a continuing relationshipwith wonderful, kind law student Ted (Mark Ruffalo). Miramax Films, which notoriously makes either Oscar bait picturesor really bad ones (there is rarely anything in between), have delayed""View From the Top"" for over a year, claiming the events of 9/11 asthe reason for its postponement. Don't believe them. The real reasonbecomes clear as crystal within the first half-hour. Poorly writtencharacters clumsily show up and disappear before any connection canbe made with them. The dim-witted story, which wouldn't have passedmuster in a 1960s movie, trudges along lugubriously, with its onlysporadic humor coming from the involvement of a few naturally funnyactors. No sense of time period is apparent, either, as the costumesare from the '60s, the music is from the '80s, and everything else seems to be modern. It is a testament to Gwyneth Paltrow's always bright talents thatshe can make even her performance here plausible and not too embarrassing.It's the film she is stuck in that should make her want to erase thisproject from her r‰sum‰. As the loony, cross-eyed John Whitney, MikeMyers (2002's ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"") garners most of the laughsto be found in an otherwise barren wasteland of material. As Donna'smentor, Sally Weston, it is a nice change of pace to see Candice Bergenin a likable part after her one-dimensional villainess roles in 2000's""Miss Congeniality"" and 2002's ""Sweet Home Alabama;"" too bad her sensitiveturn isn't at the service of a film more worthwhile. Finally, as twoof Donna's friends and co-workers, Christina Applegate is Christine,an inferior bad-girl version of her character in 2002's ""The SweetestThing,"" and Kelly Preston (1999's ""For Love of the Game"") is Sherry,who jarringly exits the picture after the first thirty minutes tonever be seen or heard from again. The predictable and unconvincing dilemma Donna is faced with--whetherto choose a lonely life doing something she enjoys, or sacrifice someof her professional dreams to be with her loving boyfriend, Ted--ismade inconsequential by the complete lack of charisma between Paltrowand Mark Ruffalo (2001's ""The Last Castle""). It doesn't help thatTed is only marginally developed as a person, and the romance is athoroughly bland and forgettable one. The film's funniest moment comes near the beginning, as inexperiencedflier Donna freaks out upon takeoff and screams amid the passengers,""we're gonna crash!"" Because of the current climate we live in, thisdecidedly un-PC joke is sharp and courageous in a way that the restof the lazy humor isn't.

917,"Whenever film-goers see something like ""Wonderland,"" whichutilizes the style of Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream""while aiming for bigger stakes than the dangers of dietpills they've got to wonder just how much pleasure illegal drugscan give.  After all, if the evidence is that drugs ruin people'scareers, drives them into bankruptcy and worse (includingviolent crime), what makes people start?  Yes, peer pressure, ofcourse.  For many, a party's not a party without a line.  Oneperson whose business went belly-up (so to speak) was pornking John Holmes, know as Johnny Wadd, a well-endowed guywith a 14-inch fireman that led him one day, perhaps in abathtub, to shout ""Eureka!  I know my calling!""  Holmes becameknown by the late seventies as the porn king, claiming to haveslept with 14,000 women to advance his mission in the hard-core porn movies racket.  Hard job, but somebody's got to do it.      As fascinating as Holmes's story must be, James Cox, directorand co-scripter of ""Wonderland,"" begins his story AFTERHolmes's porn career ends (can't win 'em all), situating thefinancially hard-up man with a group of unsavory characterswhile married to his estranged wife, Sharon (Lisa Kudrow) andhanging out with an adorable teen, Dawn Schiller (KateBosworth)  who falls in love with him at the age of fifteen. ""Wonderland"" is an intense, dramatized version of the true storyof multiple murders which took place in the summer of 1981atop Wonderland Avenue in the Laurel Canyon district of LosAngeles.  The story is violent at times as the killings arereenacted, but what hits the audience even more than the sceneof revenge murder is Cox's frenetic style.  As though afraid thattoo many moments of quiet talk and development of thecharacters could cause viewers emotionally to switch channels,he employs Darren Aronofsky's rapid shots, at times using anewspaper as a frame and bringing the pictures on the frontpages to life.       The murders, for which nobody really paid with jail time, wouldhave attracted little interest if Johnny Wadd were not so directlyinvolved.  But just what role did the ex-porn king have?  We'regiven a series of Rashomon-type insights, in one instanceinvolving the story given by biker David Lind (Dylan McDermott)which puts Johnny is one place, and one by Holmes himselfwhich situates him elsewhere.  What happened, essentially, isthat the gang from Wonderland Avenue robs millionairegangster Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian who performs his role in aHugh-Hefner-life robe and who treats his mansion as though areplica of Hefner's). Carting away $1.2 million in cash, drugsand gems, presumably operating with Holmes's insideinformation that Nash's safe is under his bed, the Wonderlandgangsters are so high on their success that you'd wonder whythey need the drugs at all.     For every action there's a reaction.  When Eddie Nash's gang,left alive by the robbers, go out for revenge, they get what theydesire, illustrated on the screen with a jolt of Tarantino-likeviolence.       Aside from the frenetic style which on the whole is a wisechoice by director Cox given the choice of developing hisnarrative in a more straightforward way the picture is blessedby remarkably intense acting, particularly by Josh Lucas asdruggie Ron Launius, who acts so ""on"" that we wonder whetherhe has ever had a moment to meditate, and we get aparticularly energetic display of vulnerability and passion fromVal Kilmer, with a full, curly head of hair, a thick beard, and twolovely women (his 13,998th and 13,999th?)in tow ",WOnderland,R,2003,2.5
918,"      ""We need a theme, a song, some visuals,"" presidential spin doctorConrad Brean explains, pitching his big project to Hollywood movieproducer Stanley Motss.  ""It's a pageant.  It's like the Oscars.That's why we need you.""       It's eleven days before the election and with the breakingrevelation that the president had molested a Firefly girl in the WhiteHouse, Conrad needs something to keep that story from making the frontpages.  Fast thinking Conrad knows just what they need, a small,cost-effective war, which he euphemistically refers to as a pageant.When asked with whom, he keeps responding, ""I'm working on it.""Finally, he comes up with the relatively obscure Albania as the perfectvillain.  Not wanting to actually fight there, he has Stanley produce awar image on a stage set.  The American public will never be the wiser,and the president will be elected with patriotic fervor rather bootedout as morally bankrupt.       Normally dramatic film director Barry Levinson, whose body of workincludes DINER, RAIN MAN, and SLEEPERS, delivers another hit in WAG THEDOG, but this time it is a black comedy.  The exceedingly bright andbiting script by Hilary Henkin and the great David Mamet will remindyou of one current event after another.  Even in the most ridiculousparts of the story, one's reaction is likely to be a double-take: an""of course not,"" followed by a ""well, maybe ...""       In a film with a modest $15 million dollar budget, the stars stillshine brightly.  Dustin Hoffman, having the time of his life anddeserving an Oscar nomination, plays producer Stanley Motss.  Stanleyviews his little war as his best piece of work ever.  He hires a famoussong writer, played by Willie Nelson, to produce a mass chorus songthat sounds similar to ""We Are The World"" but is called ""We Have TheRight To Fight For Democracy.""       As Conrad Brean, Robert De Niro has a wry smile for every hardshipin the campaign.  He's seen it all and can confuse the media fasterthan he can say that we are not sending B-3 bombers to Albania.  Leakthe story about the non-existent plane and then deny it, deny it, denyit.  Now, that will certainly flummox the press and get the sexualmisconduct story buried on page 12.       In my favorite performance in the movie, Anne Heche plays toppresidential aide Winifred Ames.  Normally in command, Winifred doesnot know what to make of Conrad, who takes control of everything.  Oneminute she tries to be tough, but the next she is looking wide-eyed atConrad's latest outlandish idea.  She always goes along, of course,that is until William H. Macy appears in a small part as a CIA agent.When trapped, she's willing to blame everyone and plead for mercy.       The best sequence in the movie concerns the construction of thewar video to show on CNN and the other news networks.  First they hirethe right young actress, played by a distraught looking Kirsten Dunst,to run away from her bomb ravaged village in Albania.  Filled on astage against a blue background, they carefully choose the right hamletfor the backdrop, pick the right flames and sounds and, in the piece deresistance, figure out the right pet for her to be clutching.  Theanimal was to have been filmed live, but something came up so Stanleygives her a large bag of Tostitos to hold instead.  They'll scan in acat in post-production.  The president, who is never seen, calls on thecell phone to insist that they use a white cat.  This infuriatesStanley, who hates it when his backers get in the way of his creativedecisions.       Many other good actors show up as well in the film with WoodyHarrelson having an eye-opening small part, which cannot be describedwithout giving too much away.       The main problem with the movie is that it is so hilarious thatyou may have to see it twice to hear all the funny lines.  The audienceat our screening could barely control themselves.       The opening credits answer the question you have about why themovie is called WAG THE DOG: ""Why does a dog wag its tail?  Because thedog is smarter than the tail.  If the tail were smarter, it would wagthe dog.""  And this marvelously funny film wags the audience until theyleave the theater limp from one belly laugh after another.       WAG THE DOG runs a fast 1:35.  It is rated R for mature themes andsome profanity and would be fine for teenagers. ",Wag the Dog,R,1997,3
919,"         WAITING TO EXHALE follows the relationship struggles of four black women, showing a bleak world where men are pigs. No, I don't take offense at the depiction. I know I'm not a pig, even though I do eat like one. And for those of you who are wondering if a white boy like me could ever begin to appreciate a movie about black women, I must remind you I was a black woman in a past life. And I spent my entire senior year in high school immersed in their culture and queen, Aretha the #551 bus driver.          The characters in this movie were waiting to exhale. I was waiting for the movie get good. They got their wish, but I never did. WAITING TO EXHALE is an uneven movie with some good scenes and some bad scenes, some that work well and others that don't. The cast is likeable,though, and the performances are exemplary, especially from Angela ""Tina Turner"" Basset. Pop star Whitney Houston has even matured acting-wise from THE BODYGUARD, though her theme song this time, ""Exhale (Shoop, Shoop)"" is no ""I Will Always Love You.""          Savannah (Houston) enjoys casual sex with various people, but is in love with a married man who promises time after time that he's going to leave his wife, but never quite gets around to it. Meanwhile, Angela Basset's husband has already left her for a white woman, so she does what any woman would do in that situation--she gathers all her husband's belongings up, takes them out to his car and lights it on fire, in what is undoubtedly the most powerful scene in the movie.          Meanwhile, Robin is in Savannah's predicament and also has a crackhead boyfriend, while Gloria, the heavyset woman, is contemplating a renewed relationship with the on-again/off-again father of her teenage son. All of them are looking for love in all the wrong places with all the wrong people, but rest assured the movie does end for the most part happily, with uncredited performances from Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines livening things up.          I couldn't say how much of this movie accurately portrays the contemporary dating scene, because I've never been part of the contemporary dating scene, but there is a lot of sex involved (in the movie, not with me), not the nude kind, but the fully-clothed bump-and-grind stuff. WAITING TO EXHALE has a lot of good elements, but a lot of mediocre or bad ones bringing it down. The four leads are all good and the depictions of their strong friendship are touching, but the story could have been told with some tigher editing and a few less voiceovers from the characters in corny prose lifted directly from the novel this movie was based on... There, I'm done. I can exhale now. ",Waiting To Exhale,R,1995,2.5
920,"      ""You know the old saying that if you don't like the weather, justwait five minutes and it will change?"" says Blaine, Missouri's proudand ever confident mayor Glenn Welsch (Larry Miller).  ""I honestlybelieve that with hard work we can get it down to 3 to 4 minutes.""Glenn has a lot to be proud of.  Blaine, ""the stool capital of theworld,"" will have its sesquicentennial celebration shortly.       Easily one of the best documentary putdowns ever was THIS ISSPINAL TAP from 1984.  I remember the show for Christopher Guest's lineabout his amplifier.  You see, their rock band was louder, and a prioribetter, than any other because their volume knob went to 11 rather thanmerely 10.       Now Christopher Guest is back with another documentary parody,WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, which is just as good as his last.  As before, hehas a leading role and cowrote the witty and intelligent script.  Thistime his cowriter is Eugene Levy.  Guest directs the film as well,which illustrates his talents better than any other part he has in thepicture.  His comedic sense of timing combined with the hilariousscript had me laughing so hard I thought I would burst.  The film is inthree acts with a delightful epilogue.  The only criticism I have ofthe picture is that the second act drags some in comparison with theothers.       Guest plays the lead as Corky St. Claire.  Corky, who has abackground in off-off-off-Broadway productions, has brought his talentsto backwoods Blaine.  Although his last production in Blaine, a stagedversion of the movie BACKDRAFT, had some unfortunate technicaldifficulties that forced the fire department to be called in, he hascreated a special musical for the town's big event.  He calls it ""Red,White, and Blaine,"" and casts a not-so-stellar local ensemble.       After an audition session where people do everything includingreading lines from RAGING BULL, Corky chooses his players.  The actorsin his musical are every bit as bad as the actors in the movie aremarvelous.       The first two members of the cast are Ron and Sheila Albertson(Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara).  They are a husband and wifesinging team and Blaine's travel agents.  (""Some people find it ironicthat although we run a travel agency, we've never been outside ofBlaine,"" confesses Ron.)  Their mannerisms are so excessively cute thatthe whole show could have been built around their characters.  Anytimeeither of them spoke, I started to giggle.  Julie Carnahan's costumesfor them feature iridescent running suits.       The third cast member is Dr. Allan Pearl (co-writer Eugene Levy),the local dentist who believes his destiny is as a stand-up comic.  Theactors in the movie approach the comedy so earnestly that I keptfinding myself beginning to take the fictional documentary as factual.The more serious they became, the funnier was the humor.  And no onewas more sincere than Dr. Pearl.       Dr. Pearl's wife (Linda Kash), who is not in the play, explainsthe life of their family.  ""We don't associate with the creativetypes,"" she tells us.  ""We have a Scrabble club.  We associate withpeople with babies.""  His wife looks upon the good doctor as her sage.""He has tried to help me change my instincts or at least ignore them,""she proudly reveals.       Rounding out the play's cast is Dairy Queen waitress Libby MaeBrown, played with perky style by Parker Posey, auto mechanic JohnnySavage (Matt Keeslar), and the town's strange old buzzard, CliffordWooley (Lewis Arquette).       The ridiculous musical with its tacky sets is reminiscent of the""Springtime for Hitler"" musical in THE PRODUCERS, which remains as oneof the funniest films ever made.  The longest and best act of the movieis the third, which is devoted to the musical.       In a movie this good it is hard to pick out a favorite part, butfor me it has to be the one where Corky shows us his movie memorabiliacollection.  His favorite, and mine, are his MY DINNER WITH ANDREaction figures.  Certainly, Andre and Wally are the most improbablecandidates for action figures imaginable.       Although I was sitting in a press screening with just four otherpeople in the theater, I felt like clapping when the film ended.  It isthat good.  A more delightful and good humored show I have not seen ina long time. ",Waiting for Guffman,R,1996,3
921,"Let me make this clear from the onset: THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.  Reportedly, just prior to the premiere of ""Waking Life"" at the 2001Sundance Film Festival, writer/director Richard Linklater (""The NewtonBoys,"" ""Slacker"") faced his audience and said, ""How many of you outthere are on drugs?"" When a number of hands were raised, he added,""Good. This is for you. The rest of you, just bear with me.""  ""Waking Life"" is 97 minutes long. For the duration of the film, variousactors discuss philosophical issues. The images of said performers,initially shot on digital film, were then turned into of ""animation"" byartists working over the rotoscoped images. The end result is akin towatching a group of cartoon characters having a feature-length latenight coffeehouse chat.  As I said, this film is not for everybody.  Visually, the results are lovely, looking like a cross between acontemporary independent comic book and some vintage hippie doodling.Features glide about, eyes briefly float over faces, etc. etc. Butdespite the flourishes, the ""cartoons"" display remarkable detailedfacial expressions and body language. Every line is in constant motion,as if filmed on a boat or an amusement park ride. The combination ofrealistic expression with surreal imagery is arresting. I would love tosee a film with a plot done in this fashion.  And then there are the actors and their words. The main character (nonames are ever given) is played by Wiley Wiggins (""Dazed and Confused"").Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, along with Speed Levitch and directorSteven Soderbergh also contribute.  Wiggins discusses his slips into dream-states with several strangers.Could he be in a constant dream-state? Could the film be a reflection ofthat? Conversational subjects include reincarnation, identity, free willand quantum mechanics, existentialism, telepathically sharedexperiences, science and God, free will and what goes on in the six to12 minutes of brain activity before it actually goes terminal.  ""Waking Life"" is an interactive movie. A great part of its value comesfrom how you react to it. For some, the conversations will be likefingernails across a blackboard. For others, the discussions will be asinvolving as the visuals are lilting. As someone currently havingextreme difficulty sleeping, I got caught up in the notion of life beinga series of shifts between one level of consciousness to another.  Take it as an experiment or a challenge. Or just pretty pictures with alot of chatter. Or don't take it at all.  As I said, this film is not for everybody. ",Waking Life,R,2001,2
922," Every now and then, a movie reviewer discovers an absolute gem- and this is a sparkler! In the remote Irish village of Tulaigh Morh(pronounced Tullymore), population 52, someone holds a winning lotteryticket worth almost seven million pounds (more than $11 million) - butwho can it be? That's the question that obsesses Jackie O'Shea (IanBannon), his wife Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) and their friend, MichaelO'Sullivan (David Kelly). Determined to discover and befriend thelucky winner in order to share some of the prize money, they enticeand ingratiate themselves to their 49 neighbors, including amalodorous pig farmer (James Nesbitt), his poetic lady love (SusanLynch), and nasty Lizzy Quinn (Eileen Dromey).  When they thinkthey've canvassed everyone, they discover one man is missing: NedDevine (Jimmy Keogh). And a search quickly determines he, indeed, isthe winner - only, the sweet, old geezer has dropped dead from theshock of his good fortune. ""They say money changes a man and there'sno greater change than moving a man from life to death,"" theymuse. So, what's a sod to do? Jackie and Michael slyly decide on a weetad of fraud and a crazed bit of blarney, determining that one of themshould impersonate Ned Devine and claim the winnings, which will thenbe equally divided among the villagers if everyone will go along withthe crazy charade. Writer/director Kirk Jones cleverly creates quirky,charming, genuinely touching characters who embark on a wonderfullyexuberant adventure. And some scenes - like the men's naked bicycleride and re-arranging the corpse's facial expression - are trulylaugh-out-loud funny. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""WakingNed Devine"" is a whimsical, mischievous 8. Enjoy the fun and you'llfeel like a winner! ",Waking Ned Devine,PG,1998,3
923,"      Given how much I loved and was enchanted by LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, Iwent to see A WALK IN THE CLOUDS with much excitement.  The same director(Alfonso Arau) and the same cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki) did bothpictures so my expectations were not unrealistic.  Both pictures have a lookand a beauty that is almost unsurpassed, but more on that later.       A WALK IN THE CLOUDS tells the story of serviceman, Paul Sutton (KeanuReeves), returning at the end of World War II.  His wife rejects him, and heleaves home.  He then comes to the aid of Victoria Aragon (AitanaSanchez-Gijon) who is newly pregnant and has never been married.  Paulagrees to pretend to be her husband for only a night.  Most of the moviethen consists of the proud, old, and extremely rich Mexican-American familyof vintners trying to find out if they are really married or not.  TheAragons live in great spender in the Napa Valley where the movie wasactually filmed.  The ethnic heritage and their great wealth made me thinkof the Gallo family albeit the Gallos are Italian-Americans.       The father, Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), takes care to remindPaul frequently that he is ""a nobody"" and that ""my daughter can trace herroots back 400 years to the best families in Mexico"".  Her grandfather, DonPedro (Anthony Quinn), is much kinder to Paul and tells him ""welcome to ourhappy family"" after the father has insulted him again.  This continuingfamily banter followed by brief scenes between Paul and Victoria is what themovie is all about.       Okay, let's cut to the chase.  This movie was a huge disappointment forme.  Keanu Reeves for all of his terrific looks can do only one thing well,action films.  He was super in SPEED, and that is about it.  He was patheticin MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and in LITTLE BUDDHA.  Her again, he proves heneeds more acting lessons and less modeling ones.       The biggest problem in the movie is that there is no chemistry betweenthe two stars.  Their lines by the writer (Robert Mark Kamen) of all theKarade Kid movies fall flat.  It is as if they are speaking to separatewalls rather than to each other.  Unlike LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, there isno magic here.  I tried as hard as I could to like this movie, but otherthan the scenic beauty, it is like a meringue.  There is nothing there whenyou bite into it.  Alberto sums up the problem with the movie when he says""There is something wrong here.  The whole thing is wrong."" Finally, theending is ridiculous and worthy of someone who blessed the world with therealism and the wisdom of the Karade Kid movies.       Although it was hard to tell given the lines she was given, I believethat Aitana Sanchez-Gijon has a lot of potential.  She is certainly one ofthe most beautiful new actresses I have seen lately.  She has a compellinglook to her in every scene.  The one of her dancing in the grapes isincredible.  You become obsessed with leaving your seat in the theater andjumping in.       Going to this movie is not a waste.  This movie deserves at least anAcademy Award nomination for cinematography and another for set design(David Gropman).  The look of the yellow and greens of the leaves, thegolden amber of sunsets on everything, and the constant backlighting of allof the characters are all worthy of Monet.  I could go on and on about howgorgeous this picture is.  Perhaps the best scene is the one of the people""flying"" in the field at night with alabaster colored wings to keep thefrost off of the grapes.  You have to see this scene to grasp its serenityand beauty.  The infrequent black and white flashbacks and flashforwardsprovide an effective contrast.  Visually, not some, but every scene is amasterpiece.  The music (Leo Brower) is quite dramatic and fits the mood ofthe show and the images very well.       A WALK IN THE CLOUDS runs too long at 1:45 thanks to poor pacing and alack of stronger editing by Don Zimmerman.  The movie is rated PG-13 sinceit is an adult drama I guess.  It is a mild PG-13 since there is noprofanity that I can remember, no violence, no nudity, and no sex.  Any kidolder than 9 should be able to see this show with no problems.  On the otherhand, I recommend this show only to people studying cinematographictechniques.  For others, you are liable to leave the show bored anddisappointed, and I recommend you pass on it.  I give the movie * 1/2 onlyfor the Academy Award quality cinematography. ","Walk in the Clouds, A",PG-13,1995,1.5
924,"We live in a cynical world, plain and simple. With so much violenceand tragedy read about in the newspapers each passing day, ""A Walkto Remember,"" based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks and directed byAdam Shankman (2001's ""The Wedding Planner""), is such an innocentand well-meaning motion picture that to criticize it strictly on thosegrounds would be to miss the point. A cogent romance about the redemptivepower of love, the film makes no excuses for its saccharine tone asit lays its cards on the table right from the beginning. When a stupid stunt leaves his friend hurt, Landon Carter (Shane West)is busted for an infraction and alcohol use. A 17-year-old seniorin the small town of Beaufort, North Carolina, Landon is a part ofthe cool group at his high school. As part of his punishment, he isforced to join the cast of the spring play, also starring longtimeclassmate Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore). The daughter of the town'sminister (Peter Coyote), Jamie is a plain jane who gets picked onfor her pure goodness, but is smart enough to not let the tauntingget in the way of her goals. Opposites attract as Landon becomes smittenby the idealistic Jamie, going against the feelings of his narrow-mindedfriends to start a relationship with her. They naturally fall in lovewith each other, but Jamie is hiding a fateful secret from Landonthat she is afraid to tell him. By the time the final thirty minutes roll around, ""A Walk to Remember""takes a turn for melodrama in the same way that 1970's ""Love Story,""2000's ""Here on Earth,"" 2000's ""Autumn in New York,"" and 2001's ""SweetNovember"" did. This twist may leave preteen fans of pop-singer-turned-actressMandy Moore (2001's ""The Princess Diaries"") reeling with shock andtears, but anyone with even a cursory knowledge of film should beable to predict what's coming long before it actually is uncovered. The climax lays the sap on thick, with scene after scene filled withtears, hurt, tragic love, anger, and a droning instrumental scoreby Mervyn Warren. Some of it is truly touching, no matter how muchyou fight it, but other moments are too weepy for their own good.With that said, ""A Walk to Remember"" ends up working in the long runbecause the first hour is so unabashedly charming, as Jamie and Landon'srelationship is set up and then believably developed.  The best scene in the picture--one that left a huge, dorky smile onmy face--has to do with Landon setting out to fulfill some of thegoals Jamie has made for herself on her ""to-do"" list. The way in whichLandon allows Jamie to be in two places at once (one of her goalson the list), played to the song ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" by Toploader,is so joyful and romantic that it had seemingly everyone in the audienceaudibly swooning, and I had a half-notion to join them. Shane West (2000's ""Whatever It Takes"") and Mandy Moore, getting ridof her blonde tresses for a brunette color, make a lovely onscreencouple, and what's more, they both have enough acting talent to pulloff some of the rockier moments in the sometimes-sticky screenplayby Karen Janszen (1997's ""The Matchmaker""). Moore luckily does notfollow down the same haphazard road as singer Mariah Carey did with2001's infamous ""Glitter,"" as she has all of the screen presence thatCarey needed, but lacked. More promising is to consider what a 180-degreeturn this role is for Moore after her mean-spirited character in ""The Princess Diaries."" As Landon's single mother and Jamie's preacher father, Daryl Hannah(1999's ""My Favorite Martian"") and Peter Coyote (2000's ""Erin Brockovich"")provide solid support, although Hannah's brown wig couldn't look morefake if she tried. There is one scene where you can even blatantlysee Hannah's blonde hair sticking out from under the dark rug. ""A Walk to Remember"" is far from perfect, but its heart is in theright place. Jamie is one of the most positive role models to comearound in a film in some time, and Mandy Moore plausibly pulls hercharacter off without much strain. Whether one gets lost in the romanceand the drama or spitefully rejects its sheer earnestness, nobody,I think, could possibly say there isn't a definite audience for harmless,unobjectionable teen fare like ""A Walk to Remember.""

925,"      WALKING AND TALKING is another one of those talkfest shows.  Withthe right script these can be among the most enjoyable and rewarding ofany cinematic experience.  From MY DINNER WITH ANDRE to DINER to BEFORESUNRISE, this is a genre of which I have always been especially fond.Thanks to an energetic cast this movie tries hard and almost delivers.Sad to say that the directing and writing by Nicole Holofcener is notof the same caliber.  This is not a bad show just a disappointing one.It is one that keeps your attention and never drags.       WALKING AND TALKING starts with two preteen girls reading ""The Joyof Sex"" together in bed.  They are enthralled with it, but after thisbrief scene we cut to them grown up and still friends.  They are justas much interested in sex, but only one of them has been lucky in love,and the other is jealous.       Amelia (Catherine Keener who starred LIVING IN OBLIVION) and Laura(Anne Heche who played Juliet in THE JUROR) are two attractive youngwomen.  Laura is living with her fiance Frank (Todd Field who playedBeltzer in TWISTER).  They all live in New York City.  Amelia works inthe newspaper classified section, Laura is an apprentice therapist, andFrank designs costume jewelry including ""men's leisure rings.""       Amelia was once almost lucky in love.  Her ex-boyfriend, Andrew(Liev Schreiber from DENISE CALLS UP), and she are still friends, butneither can figure out why they broke up.  Their conversations tryingto figure it out are among the best in the show.  There is also arunning gag about his having phone sex with this woman in SanFrancisco.  Amelia does not approve, especially when he tries to borrowmoney from her to pay his enormous phone bill.       Into Amelia's life comes an ugly guy, Bill (Kevin Corrigan), whoworks at her local video store, and who is heavily into the horrormovie production business.  Laura and Frank jokingly encourage herfriendship with Bill since he is so ugly, she will not have to worryabout any commitments.  A good one-night stand for her.       The show is so completely natural that it borders onamateurishness at times.  The actors are all good, and it is anensemble cast, but, on the whole, the show promises more than itdelivers.  The script is just not intelligent enough, and there are nomemorable lines.  I like the characters and the acting, but there isjust not quite enough there.       WALKING AND TALKING runs 1:30.  It is rated R.  There is more badlanguage than there needs to be, and there is a single brief drugscene.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence.  Even the skinny-dippingscene is done with their underwear on.  The show would be fine for anyteenager.  It is a marginal call, but there is not enough substance forme to be able to recommend it.  I give it **. ",Walking and Talking,R,1996,2
926,"Whenever a superior civilisation, state or life formencounter its inferior counterpart, the latter is almostalways subdued or eradicated by brutal force. At least, thatwas the case with the state of international politics inlate 19th Century when H.G. Wells tried to speculate aboutsuch practices on inter-planetary level. The result was THEWAR OF THE WORLDS, one of the first classical sci-fi novelsthat, like THE TIME MACHINE by the same authors, establishedthe sub-genre of First Contact stories. Images created bythat novel later proved almost prophetic, in theunimaginable and utter destruction of two world wars. Thetechnology of the destruction was man- made, but for thevictims, faced with certain destruction by unstoppable andtechnically superior machines, it didn't make anydifference. The proof for that came in the form of famousradio-adaptation by Orson Welles, when the ensuing panicpre-ceded later horrors of London Blitz, Dresden andHiroshima. The same feeling of fear and helplessness infront of the superior technology also resonated well withthe anxieties of people in the atomic era, who used to livein the shadow of Cold War. Such atmosphere brought thirdincarnation of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, this time in the formof a 1953 science fiction movie, directed by Byron Haskinand produced by George Pal, one of the legends of thatparticular genre.  The film begins with the narration by Cedric Hardwicke thatdescribes Mars as the planet of superior, yet dyingcivilisation, desperate for rich resources of Earth.Martians are studying Earth and preparing for the invasion.First Martian probe lands in small Californian town of LindaRosa. Group of scientists from a nearby observatory, led byClayton Forrester (played by Gene Barry), comes toinvestigate, but the object is too hot and, before it coolsoff, Forrester takes much more interest in Sylvia Van Buren(played by Ann Robinson), daughter of the local priest. Inthe mean time, the crew of Martian probe awakens and thethree local policemen guarding the site are the first to bepulverised with deadly Martian beams. Seeing Martians ashostile, authorities bring the military, but the bestequipment of this world is powerless against the invadersfrom another world. Soon, the world is full of similarMartian crafts that start their unstoppable reign ofdestruction. While the governments of the world are workingdesperately to stop the invasion and apparent annihilationof the humanity, Forrester and Sylvia are trying to escapeMartians that are now roaming the ground, outside theirvessels. After they reach relative safety of Los Angeles,Forrester and his colleagues are trying to devise a weaponthat would prove to be effective against Martians. But wheneven the atom bomb proves useless against Martians, all hopeseems to be gone.  THE WAR OF THE WORLDS was one of the most successful sciencefiction films of its time. Its popularity came partlybecause the script seemed very much in line with the anxietyof the times, as well as with the traumatic memories of WW2.But the main reason was probably in the special effects,that were state-of-the-art for its times, and that couldeven be impressive today. The popularity of this film latertransformed into cult status among the genre aficionados,and many successful and important science fiction films ofthe later age were heavily influenced with it. The examplemost often referenced is Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THETHIRD KIND, although mostly in a visual sense, because thosetwo films are extremely different in their depictions ofFirst Contact and human reaction to the unknown.  When THE WAR OF THE WORLDS gets compared with another filmthat was heavily influenced by it, Devlin and Emmerich'sINDEPENDENCE DAY, it becomes clearly obvious why the formeris regarded as important classic and latter as nothing morethan forgettable ""thrillride of the summer"". Its directorHaskin was hardly a top Hollywood director, but the group oftalented artists provided a whole series of memorable,spectacular and even today very effective scenes, especiallythose involving destruction of the cities and panic in thestreets. The script itself, written by Barre Lyndon, wasn'tso successful. Many times story meanders along unecessarysubplots, especially those involving obligatory romancebetween the macho scientist and damsel in distress. Theending, although based on the original novel, seems somewhattoo melodramatic and deus ex machina. And I don't think thatH.G. Wells, known for his atheistic beliefs, would be tooenthusiastic about its heavy religious overtones. But,despite those flaws, and despite the fact that it was firmlyin the B movies category, THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a classicthat should be seen by anyone who really likes genre ofscience fiction in the cinema. ",War Of The Worlds,G,1953,3
927,"""How obscene that your mother should give her life so thatyou could have her space on earth.""  Imagine the hurt ayoung woman must feel to hear words like that from the fathershe once adored.  As though this utterance were not enoughof a cross to bear, this vulnerable individual hears an outburstfrom the lover for whom she waited one year, who proclaimsthat since he has all the charm and she nothing but money,he should be entitled to a share of her wealth after marriage. What gives ""Washington Square"" its particularly invitingquality is that throughout the film the audience does not trulyknow whether the young, handsome and captivating suitor ofa shy, innocent person is after her for her money or whetherhe truly loves her.  What's more, Henry James, who wrote hisnovel about a family high in New York social circles, wants usto have mixed feelings about the cynical and verbally abusivefather.  Does he want to protect his only daughter from thepitches of fortune hunters, or is just plain ornery about a girlwhose delivery resulted in the childbirth death of his wife?  It'sno wonder that this readable classic was the subject of amajor film forty-eight years ago, entitled ""The Heiress"" andstarring Ralph Richardson, Montgomery Clift and Olivia deHavilland; and of a recent stage version at New York'sRoundabout Theater with Philip Bosco and Cherry Jones inthe leading roles. Given a moderately feminist twist by Agnieszka Holland in abeautifully photographed new movie, ""Washington Square""features Jennifer Jason Leigh in the role of Catherine Sloper,an awkward girl who becomes her own woman and gains acomeuppance against the two men whose mixed feelingstoward her caused so much distress.  Adapted from the HenryJames novel by screenwriter Carol Doyle and photographedin Baltimore by Jerzy Zielinski, this ""Washington Square"" maydisappoint those who prefer the theatrical revenge conclusionof the Roundabout Theater's production but will please thosewho like their movies to remain close to the literary designs ofthe novelists.  ""Washington Square"" shows its waresrealistically with only a brief outpouring of histrionics, andconveys a tidy look at a portion of New York society a centuryand a half ago. In dealing with the life of Ms. Sloper before she meets hereager suitor, director Holland selects a few seminal episodesin her early life to impart the young girl's awkwardness. Particularly moving, almost painful to watch, is a song recitalshe is about to give to an audience of father, aunts, unclesand cousins, only to freeze with stagefright and urinatecopiously on the living room floor.  Despite theembarrassment and shame she seems to cause the fathershe tries heartbreakingly to please, her dad, Dr. Austin Sloper(Albert Finney), makes clear that she has no social graces,limited looks, and an inability to capture the attentions of aneligible bachelor.  Encouraged by a slightly dotty and lovingAunt Lavinia (Maggie Smith) who lives with the family,Catherine accepts the attentions of a handsome, magneticsuitor, Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin), a penniless memberof society who at first appears to have ardent feelings for her. When Dr. Sloper--who calls Morris an idler who is out formoney--threatens to disinherit Catherine unless she breaks offthe relationship, even taking her on a one-year trip to Europeto allow Catherine's feelings to cool, the lines are effectivelydrawn. While Ms. Holland does furnish the flavor of New Yorksociety by giving us glimpses into the parties, by carefullyshowing us the far-reaching and lavishly furnished home at 21Washington Square, by offering a look at the many servants,she avoids the lush and stilted theatricality of Merchant-Ivoryproductions while displaying a movie far more toned downthan her own ""Total Eclipse"" (about the relationship betweenPaul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud).  Her calm approachprovides a note of authenticity and realism to the goings-onwhile retaining dramatic punch through a single, showdownscene between Catherine and her suitor, Morris Townsend. While Cherry Jones, who shone in the cast of theRoundabout Theater production some years back, might haveoffered a more genuine reading of Catherine's character,Jennifer Jason Leigh does fine, broadening her range afterappearing previously in terminally cynical roles such as that ofDorothy Parker.  Albert Finney is more in tune with thedoctor's persona than the blustery and less witty Philip Bosco,who re-created the role alongside Cherry Jones, and BenChaplin plays the part subtly enough that we are keptspeculating about his motives. ""Washington Square,"" then, is a down-to-earth piece ofmoviemaking filled with solid performances and a mildlyfeminist resolution which should please many withoutoffending audience members of a conservative bent. ",Washington Square,PG,1997,3
928," Adam Sandler summarized this and his whole string oflightweight movies (""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Billy Madison,"" ""HappyGilmore"") when he said, ""We're just having fun, and I hope everyonehas fun right along with us."" And there's something funny andendearing about Adam Sandler, even if his moronic movies are simplyvariations on each other and he always plays the nerdy, haplesshero. This time, he's a seemingly dim-witted, socially inept 31year-old from the swamps of Louisiana who works as a lowly water boy,although he loves dispensing H2O to dehydrated athletes and trulybelieves that it's life's greatest calling. His over-protectivemother, Kathy Bates, has home-schooled him in the bayou, so his onlycontact with his peers is his job, where the jocks rib himrelentlessly and his coach won't let him fight back. Then, one day, hegets a new coach, Henry Winkler, who consults ""The Idiot's Guide toCoaching."" After years of holding in his fury, Sandler's finallyallowed to release his pent-up Cajun rage, and he's suddenlytransformed into the most devastating tackle on the team. Problem is:he has to go to college at the same time - behind his mother'sback. And Kathy Bates is hilarious, cookin' snakes 'n' biscuits 'n''gators, shootin' off her mouth, and muggin' in front of the TVcameras at a game. Fairuza Balk is amusing, too, as his wacko,knife-wielding, jailbird girl-friend. Directed by Frank Coraci,written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, the comedy is primarilyvisual, and the zaniest bits are often at the edge of the main action- like the depressed, unkempt, bourbon-drinking cheerleaders on theloser football team. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""TheWaterboy"" is a silly, fumbling 3, delivering a bucketful of laughs. ","Waterboy, The",PG-13,1998,1.5
929,"      WATERWORLD or HOLLYWOOD GOES JUNK was of the most controversialfilms of 1995.  With a budget of over $175,000,000 producer KevinCostner apparently asked set designer Dennis Gassner to go to a localjunkyard and construct a set for a future world only out of cast offpieces of metal.  WATERWORLD looks like a low budget BLADE RUNNER GOESTO SEA.  How can the most expensive movie ever made look so ugly?Where did the money go?       Although not near as bad as it seems at first, this is a film withan innumerable list of problems.  The script by Peter Rader, DavidTwohy, and Joss Whedon is needlessly confusing.  Watching it is likestarting with episode seven of the ""The Forsyte Saga"" and trying todecipher what has been happening.  I had the same feeling when tryingto parse the story in the failed movie DUNE.       WATERWORLD is set in the environmentalist most popular apocalypticview of the future.  The polar ice caps have melted, and the world isall water.  The most valuable possession is dirt so that people cangrow plants, and the most hoarded commodity is oil for water-skis andboats.       Some people are beginning to mutate into humans with gills who canswim underwater for long periods of time.  The Mariner (Kevin Costner)is one such mutant.  He is a loner who is willing to kill women andchildren to ensure his survival, and yet he turns into one of the mosttender characters in the movie.       He may or may not know where dry land is, and dry land is the holygrail for everyone in WATERWORLD.  Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) has alittle girl named Enola (Tina Majorino) in her care.  Enola has atattoo on her back that is rumored to be some indecipherable map to dryland.  Circumstances have cast all of them together on his boat.       Dennis Hopper loves to overact.  As the Deacon, the leader of theevil Smokers, he plays his usual part.  He gets to mouth inanities suchas, ""if I ever see him again, I'm going to cut open his head and eathis brain.""  The script dares you to take it seriously while for allintents and purposes becoming a parody of bad science fiction movies.       The movie consists of The Mariner, Helen, and Enola looking fordry land with the Smokers in hot pursuit to kill them and to find dryland.  The movie is filled with stunt after unbelievable stunt in thebattle of the Smoker army against The Mariner.       Many of the scenes in the show make little sense, and yet for somereason the film begins to grow on you after a while.  I am not surewhy.  Perhaps you get sucked into the story.  Is there dry land left,and if so, how exactly will they find it.  Perhaps it is Tripplehorn's(BASIC INSTINCT and THE FIRM) beauty and toughness.  She can look greatin rags and even while starving to death.  Maybe it is Costner'sbeguiling little smile.  I don't know, but I stayed with it until theend.  I did not need to.  If you've seen part of it, there is littleneed to see the rest since it is basically the same.  I found theending a let down and did not care for the way the story was wrappedup.       There is one quite magical scene in the film where The Marinertakes Helen on an underwater journey and breathes for both of them.Here the sets finally have some beauty.  Were that the rest of the filmwere of equal quality.       WATERWORLD runs way too long at 2:14.  It is rated PG-13.  Thereis brief nudity, some intense violence, and some bad language.  I waskind of surprised it didn't get an R rating.  The show should be finefor teenagers and perhaps for some mature kids ten and over.  Althoughthe show grew on me, it is too ridiculous for me to recommend it.  Igive it **. ",Waterworld,PG-13,1995,2
930,"During one creative writing class in a small, leafy collegecommunity, Jack Linden (Mark Ruffalo), an instructor, reads aportion from Leo Tolstoy's ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich."" A studentprotests that the ending is downbeat, to which Linden replies thatnot all stories end happily ever after: sometimes an author justwant to give his readers a picture of death. Similarly, scripterLarry Gross, adapting two of Andre Dubus's short stories, unfoldsa painful sketch of two couples; Jack Linden, who is married toTerry (Laura Dern); and Hank Evans (Peter Krause) who ismarried to Edith (Naomi Watts). This is by no means an upbeatstory, but while ""We Don't Live Here Any More"" is not a picture ofdeath itself, it's an intimate, painful tale of a pair of marriageswhich have been dying for a while, its participants in denial aboutthe seriousness. I suppose we could rejoice that ultimately,Gross will allow the four to part, albeit not amicably, escapingfrom the bad in order to take their chances separately.Directed by John Curran, the film unfolds upon two people whohave quite a bit in common, since Hank and Jack teach the samecourses in creative writing in the same small town, the fourindividuals partying together with surface joy, trying nobly torepress what has not yet been said. Edith, who comes across asthe horniest of the quartet, thinks nothing of renting a motel roomto further her tryst with Jack, while Terry, despite the smallnessof the town, appears oblivious to the cheating ways of her man. Not that Terry is so guiltless_she has been carrying on an affairwith Jack's best friend, Hank, while Jack gives no hint in his easybanter with Hank that he is in the know any more than his joggingcompanion. The bitter arguments that appear to involve most of Jack andTerry's home life are not motivated by any knowledge of outsideaffairs, but despite the extra vitriol that comprises her side of thebitter feud, a passive-aggressive Jack is hardly without blame. Though Hank is the cuter male who displays a playful side whendiscussing his attempts to get published, his wife has eyes onlyfor Hank. You've got to wonder about a college when a writingthrows a party just because the New Yorker magazine accepts asingle poem. Director Curran is not shy about sending us graphic pictures ofthe lovemaking between Jack and Edith, the four performersacting their roles perfectly_with Naomi Watts conveying intensedesire whenever she is within an arm's distance or less from theobject of her lust. The story gets soapy toward the conclusion,but ""We Don't Live Here Any More"" makes us think, ""Hey,Edward Albee, move over: ïWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' is astory that is repeated over and over in the movies and on stageand presumably in the larger reality of life itself.",We Don't Live Here Anymore,R,2004,3
931,"When casting a light comedy, Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey wouldprobably be two of the last names that would come to mind. But in AdamShankman's THE WEDDING PLANNER these choices prove superb. A good-spirited,romantic comedy with an almost child-like innocence, the movie sweeps youoff your feet and puts you in the mood for laughter and love. The frequently inspired script is by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis -- a pairof love birds, according to the press kit, whose relationship did notsurvive the many years it took to get the script produced. THE WEDDINGPLANNER is a film that's easy to fall in love with, but, like the writers'romance, the relationship gets rocky. After a marvelously successful firsthalf, the romantic comedy runs out of humor, leaving the love story alone tocarry the second part. It turns out, however, that the film is at its mostromantic precisely when it's the funniest. Mary Fiore (Lopez) is the wedding planner. An anal-retentive whoalphabetizes her credit cards, Mary laments that ""Those who can't do, teach,and those who can't wed, plan."" But she is a planner par excellence, runningweddings with hilarious, military precision. ""Cover me. The FOB is MIA"", shebarks to her assistant, Penny (Judy Greer), over her wireless microphone.(Translation: The father of the bride is missing.) After Dr. Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey), Mary's knight in shining armorrescues her from a killer dumpster, it's love at first site. There is,however, the slightest of problems. Steve turns out to be the groom of herhigh profile new client, Fran Donolly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras). To addfurther complications, Mary's father (Alex Rocco) introduces her to MassimoLanzetta (Justin Chambers), her newly arranged husband-to-be. The last timeMary saw Massimo, he was a mud-munching little kid in Sicily. Judging fromhis accent, he just got off the boat. The chemistry between the control-freak wedding planner and the more laidback pediatrician is delightful. They create sparks on the screen eventhough their relationship is confined to a single kiss.  The movie is easily one of the mildest PG-13 films in recent memory. Save areference to a female organ and an innocent and sweetly funny sceneinvolving a male nude statue, the movie would have been at most PG.  THEWEDDING PLANNER is a comedy that warms your heart instead of grossing outyour stomach. Imagine that. It's no coincidence that some of the key sceneshappen while an old film is playing in the background. In many ways, THEWEDDING PLANNER is a charming throwback to a simpler time at the cinema. Butthe film never feels dated. It's a dynamite date movie and a good familyfilm as well. THE WEDDING PLANNER runs 1:40. It is rated PG-13 for language and somesexual humor and would be acceptable for all ages.","Wedding Planner, The",PG-13,2001,3
932," It would be easy to dismiss ""The Wedding Singer."" The film is admittedly fluff; just another throwaway comedy from a Saturday Night Live alumnus. The characters are mostly two-dimensional and the jokes are obvious and often corny. But the central romantic storyline is so sweet and good natured that it's fairly easy to overlook the film's many shortcomings. Ultimately, ""The Wedding Singer"" succeeds as light entertainment, a surprising triumph of charm over shtick.Set in 1985, the story focuses on Robby Hart (Adam Sandler,) a former rock star wannabe who earns his living singing at weddings. Robby is very good at his job, as evidenced in the opening scene, when a drunken best man (Steve Buscemi) turns a toast into a hateful tirade and Robby's adept damage control defuses the volatile situation. An incurable romantic, Robby's world comes crashing down around him when his childhood sweetheart (Angela Featherstone) leaves him standing at the altar. He collapses into a bundle of pain and self-pity, only to be drawn out by Julia (Drew Barrymore,) an innocent young co-worker engaged to a philandering stud (Matthew Glave.) Will Robby and Julia escape their wretched fates and find true love together? You do the math.>From a script by Judd Apatow, Carrie Fisher and Tim Herlihy, ""The Wedding Singer"" operates on two very elementary levels. There's the love story, of course, which is straightforward and sentimental without getting too sticky. The rest of the film is broad comedy, playing off the pop culture and manners of the mid-80s. Predictably, the film makes great sport of the entertainment and fashions of the period. Julia's fiancee wears the latest ""Miami Vice"" pastel outfits, complete with a perpetual three-day growth of beard. Other supporting characters ape the fashion stylings of Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson, while jokes about Rubik's Cubes, ""Dallas,""  A Flock Of Seagulls and Van Halen are self-consciously inserted. The gags about the 80s are sometimes funny, despite being overly obvious and smug. In a few years, we'll probably be subjected to comedies looking back on those wacky days in the 90s, featuring tattooed, multi-pierced characters in droopy trousers prattling on about Laser Tag, ""South Park,"" and the Spice Girls. The film's most tired joke involves an elderly person acting ""hip,"" in this case an old lady ""bustin' a move"" to the Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight."" Back in 1972, Ruth Gordon pioneered the ""isn't it hilarious when octogenarians use trendy slang and swear"" genre of comedy in ""Harold and Maude."" It was funny then, but only for about half of the film. 26 years later, the joke is annoying beyond belief. So why is ""The Wedding Singer"" getting a marginal recommendation? Because of Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler. Barrymore has grown from ""that cute little girl in 'E.T.'"" into a beautiful, fresh-faced young woman. A few years ago, Barrymore appeared on David Letterman's show the night he was celebrating his birthday. As her gift, she danced on his desk, at one point turning her back on the audience and briefly flashing her breasts at Dave. On numerous occasions, Letterman has talked about his fond memories of the incident, always describing Barrymore as ""charming"" and ""sweet."" It's easy to understand why he'd feel that way. Barrymore possesses such an air of innocence that actions that might seem vulgar if done be others come off as playful and disarming. As Julia, she is a delight, radiating a fresh-scrubbed goodness and generating real chemistry with Sandler. For his part, Sandler does his best film work to date, playing an actual person for the first time. Sandler, who can somehow look handsome and gooney simultaneously, is an intriguing performer, with a career built on playing a variety of whining half-wits. He's the kind of comic who is often funny, but just as often so irritating that you'd like to take a swing at him. In ""The Wedding Singer,"" Sandler reigns in his more annoying character traits for the most part, playing a veritable Boy Scout lost in the self-centered, hedonistic 80s. If he continues in this vein and avoids reverting to his idiot persona, he may actually be able to play a full-fledged adult someday.In addition to Sandler and Barrymore, ""The Wedding Singer"" boasts a terrific soundtrack, packed with great songs from the 80s. Pretend-punk Billy Idol even makes a cameo appearance, playing himself in the film's cheesy, but satisfying climax.Thanks to Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, ""The Wedding Singer"" is a modest success, offering laughs and a tender romance to boot. The film is just a trifle, but in the mid-winter cinematic wasteland, you have to grade on a curve. ","Wedding Singer, The",PG-13,1998,2
933,"Men are more violent than women by far, but since hell hath nofury like a woman scorned, watch out for the fair sex or do youthink Clytemnestra, Medea, and Lady Macbeth are merelyfictional characters and Lizzie Bordon just the title of a song? Kathryn Bigelow illustrates the fury of women convincingly,entertainingly, and with remarkable faith to an actual case of axe-murder. She weaves the historical past & fictionalized present intoa thoroughly modern yarn about the growing tension of an enragedfemale when in close quarters with the objects of her disaffection. Based on best-selling novel by Alice Shreve and adapted for thescreen by Alice Arlen, Kathryn Bigelow's smoldering tale ofhatred, envy and murderous rage shifts regularly from the year2000 to the year 1873 and back, both settings filmed in the areaof Halifax but actually occurring on Smuttynose Island off the NewHampshire coast.   The historical record indicates that Maren Hontvedt (SarahPolley) traveled from her native Norway to America with herhusband, not particularly pleased with her rocky digs and notoverly enamored of her much older spouse.  Truth to tell, she'shad a hot thing going with her brother back in Norway, a passionthat is illustrated clearly when her brother, Evan (Anders W.Berthelsen) goes to Smuttynose on a visit with his bubbly wife,Karen (Katrin Cartlidge).  Fuming that her prosperous brotherthrew her over for an urbanized woman, Maren takes a Medea-style revenge, blaming all on a poor Rasputin-looking shlub(Ciaran Hinds). The principal benefit of fiction is entertainment, of course, butclosely behind that is its capacity to teach us about the humancondition, or more specifically to allow us to relate our ownemotions to those of the characters in the novels and movies. When in the modern part of the story Jean Janes (CatherineMcCormack) takes off with her Pulitzer-prize winning poethusband Thomas (Sean Penn) to write and photograph amagazine story about a double-murder in 1873, she may haveknown the feelings erupting beneath Maren's taciturn andinnocent-looking surface, but only intellectually.  After all, howmany people can really feel the incredible rage that would leadone to murder in the heat of passion?  But when her own marriageundergoes a challenge on board the boat operated by her brother-in-law, Rich (Josh Lucas), then she knows what Maren felt with acapital K-N-O-W-S.  The cause of this anger?  Rich's girl friendAdaline Gunne (Elizabeth Hurley) flirts mischievously with Jean'shusband, lying bare-breasted on the deck of the boat sensuallychewing an ice cube and rubbing it across her body while lookingcoquettishly at Thomas who, it turns out, had once been anacquaintance of his some time ago.  Thomas is hardlyunresponsive. Since the action in 1873 takes place almost completely within arugged cabin and on a brief stretch of rocky territory just outside,and given that the goings on in the year 2000 are restricted to aboat, the claustrophobic settings furnish all the needed motivationfor the rising anger felt by Maren 130 years ago and by Jean in ourown time.  The murders that took place then are a mirror of thetragic course of events that will take place on Rich's boat in thehere-and-now.  Kathryn Bigelow's weaving of the two eras to showtheir similarities is, as the cliche goes, seamless.

934,"Sam Rockwell does an admirable job holding up the holdupteam in Anthony & Joe Russo's flip caper pic, ""Welcome toCollinwood."" Situated in the Russos' romantic Cleveland, the film,which borrows from Mario Monicelli's superior 1958 Italian parody""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" (which bombed in a laterincarnation on Broadway), is whimsical enough not to overstay its82-minute hold on our attention.   What could have been a truethrowaway comedy is sustained by lying midway betweenarthouse fare and commercial sitcom, its idiosyncratic charactersand deadpan humor giving the story more heft than you'dotherwise expect.  While producer George Clooney stays in thebackground, handing the heist principally over to Sam Rockwelland Michael Jeter, these performers are made for their roles,particularly the muscular Mr. Rockwell whose facial expressionsbear witness to his elation and misery alike. This bevy of bumbling bandits, losers all, remind one of the bankrobber who donned his ski mask, waited on the back of the line,and put his social security number on the deposit slip with a noteannouncing the stickup.  Luckily for the stability of this country,most such crooks have lower I.Q.'s than the cops and feds whochase them regularly or the local banks would have to ask NewYork's Mayor Mike for loans every week. Giving rise to some new terms that NY Times columnist WilliamSafire ought to discuss in his weekly magazine contribution onlanguage, the guys who plan to spend three or four hours patientlydrilling into a diamond-containing safe at first look for a ""Bellini"" (ajob that could allow the crooks to retire for life) and a ""Mullinski""(someone willing to take another's rap in return for money). Whena lifer cellmate of Cosimo (Luis Guzman) tells the story of asafecracking opportunity, Cosimo breaks out of jail and joins ateam including the egotistical amateur boxer Pero (SamRockwell), Cosimo's girl Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson), Riley(William H. Macy), Toto (Michael Meter) and Leon (IsaiahWashington).  All could use the money, but none is moredesperate than Riley, who needs a grand to get his wife out of jailand to feed the baby he lugs with him everywhere.  When for $500a lesson, wheelchair-bound Jerzy (George Clooney) teaches thegang how to break into a safe, the motley crew are on their way,breaking into the apartment with the stones.  Everything, buteverything goes wrong, but all is not lost since one of the gang,Basic (Andrew Davoli) falls for Leon's sister Michelle (GabrielleUnion) while Pero takes up with the flighty Carmela (JenniferEsposito). This is the sort of material that simply had to be copied timeand again.  In addition to the hit Italian movie and the doomedBroadway show, no less a director than Louis Malle tried to cashin with ""Crackers,"" but not even Donald Sutherland, Sean Pennand Wallace Shawn could evoke the laughs of the current version. Light, forgettable, cute.",Welcome To Collinwood,R,2002,3
935,"After completing a second term in office, President of the UnitedStates Monroe 'Eagle' Cole (Gene Hackman) returns to his sleepy summerhome of Mooseport, Maine to prepare his next move. With his power-hungryex-wife, Charlotte (Christine Baranski), demanding his money and materialpossessions, Monroe is ultimately egged on to run for mayor of Mooseportas a way of confirming his political worth. Following Monroe's advanceson veterinarian Sally (Maura Tierney), however, he soon acquires anunlikely opponent: Sally's nice guy plumber boyfriend, Handy Harrison (Ray Romano).  Directed by Donald Petrie (2003's ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days""),""Welcome to Mooseport"" wants to be a quirky political satire, somethingof a cross between 1999's ""Election"" and 2000's ""State and Main,""but it lacks a sharp satiric edge. In fact, its would-be satire isn'tsatire at all, but unfunny slapstick and one-liners mixed with a sitcom-levelsensibility. In other words, it's a dumbed-down small screen venturedressed in fancy feature film clothing and featuring a sparkling ensemblefar better than the material deserves.  While ""Welcome to Mooseport"" is consistently watchable, it doesn'thave that extra spark req uired to make it anything but instantlyforgettable. The comedy comes in two varieties„low-key and broad„butmost of it is disposably corny and not worth more than a nod of recognitionor a smile. The amount of laugh-out-loud moments could be countedon a two-fingered hand, and even those couple are fleeting at best.  As for the plight of Handy to win back longtime girlfriend Sally,who has grown frustrated by his failure to pop the question, it isdifficult to get behind a man as daft as him. Throughout, the vieweris led to wonder exactly why he can't understand that she wants toget married. When the epiphany belatedly arrives, Handy's reasoningfor not having the courage to ask Sally to marry him is tacky: he's scared.  The cast, at least, is game enough to make for a marginally amusingtime. For Gene Hackman, his part of Monroe Cole is an undemandingone, but he is effortless in his portrayal. Hackman was given farfunnier material in 2001's superior ""Heartbreakers,"" but he does blessMonroe with a level of sympathy. Monroe is a man who prides himselfon being a truly honest president, even when in reality he isn't entirely,and this quandary is made palpable thanks to Hackman's portrayal.In his film debut, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" star Ray Romano is withinhis comfort zone as Handy, but because he is the straight man he isgiven few chances to show off his comic persona.  As the ever-torn Sally, Maura Tierney (2002's ""Insomnia"") is charmingenough in the role of the romantic foil, while the incomparable MarciaGay Harden (2003's ""Mystic River"") refuses to be underused by bringingdepth and likability to Monroe's committed assistant, Grace. Roundingout the ensemble, Fred Savage (2002's ""The Rules of Attraction"") isBullard, Monroe's harried other assistant, and Christine Baranski(2003's ""Marci X"") is typecast as the President's ""Wicked Witch ofthe West Wing"" ex-wife, Charlotte.  For the most part, ""Welcome to Mooseport"" is so laid-back that whateverdriving energy it might have had proves insubstantial in the finalcut. The whole movie is like that. With a plodding story and a just-okayscreenplay by Tom Schulman (1998's ""Holy Man""), nothing on displayis worth the trip to the theater. Having only seen ""Welcome to Mooseport""eight hours ago (and immediately before a screening of the amazingand surprising best film of the year so far, ""The Girl Next Door""),it has already begun to drift from my memory.",Welcome To Mooseport,PG-13,2004,2
936,"      Remember being 11 years old and in junior high?  Cast your mindback to when you got your tray in the cafeteria and looked out onto themass of humanity trying to figure out with whom you could sit.Remember that feeling of potential rejection around every corner?Remember the horror of puberty?  I have never seen a film that capturesthe inner terror of that time better than WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE.       This film is being billed as ""deliriously wicked"" or ""hilariousblack comedy.""  Certainly the film is funny, but to me it is first andforemost a gripping tragedy - sad and somewhat disturbing.  I was sotouched by the excellent and realist script and the moving acting byHeather Matarazzo as the protagonist Dawn Wiener that I was near tearsthrough out the entire show and stayed right on the edge of my seat.It is extremely easy to empathizes with Dawn.  I would rate this filmin the most see category for parents, but it is so brilliant, Isincerely hope everyone sees it.       Dawn has looks, that while not ugly, are subpar.  To this shedresses herself in gaudy clothes (costumes by Melissa Toth) and wearsunattractively framed glasses.  She is ostracized by her fellowstudents who call her ""Wienerdog,"" and who torment her at their everychance.  In junior high, homophobic epithets are particularly popular.Dawn is nonplused by her treatment and asks one of her tormentors, ""Whydo you hate me?""  To which the simple reply is, ""Because you're ugly.""Think back now.  Yes, junior high is like that for some.       Dawn has other problems than junior high.  At home she has a 5year old sister, aptly named Missy (Daria Kalinina), who has the looksof a child model and who is always in her ballet costume demonstratingher great artist abilities.  Dawn is jealous of her and complains toher that ""you are so lucky.""       She has an older brother Mark (Matthew Faber) who is currently inhigh school, but is in the fast lane to a good college and from thereto be an entrepreneur who will probably be worth zillions.  When hisDad (Bill Buell) goes into the hospital, he is too busy to visitbecause he has ""a big forensic society debate.""  His mother (AngelaPietropinto) agrees that is more important seeing his father.       Both siblings view Dawn as a misfit in their family.  At thedinner table one night, Dawn says something about her sister, and hermother gets angry and pointing her finger at Dawn she demands, ""Dawn,you do not leave this table until you tell your sister that you loveher!""  I like the realistic way this dispute gets resolved in the show.       A lot of the story deals with adolescence's obsession with sex.Dawn asks her brother, ""Do you think about girls?""  He glares at herfrom his computer and responds, ""Are you kidding?  I want to get into agood school.""  Dawn has no such aspirations.  Her grades are poor andher artistic abilities are, well, limited.  Most scripts would havecoped out by compensated Dawn's mediocre looks with strong academicstrengths, but not this one.       When Dawn is not just spending her time coping, she dreams ofmaking it with the most popular kid in high school, Steve Rodgers (EricMabius).  In my favorite small scene from the show, she sits on a carswaying to Steve's singing ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" in a band that ispracticing in their garage.  This is one of the few times she is reallyhappy.       Dawn spends most of the film in search of happiness.  She musesthat perhaps it lives just over the horizon in high school.  Markbreaks this bubble by informing her, ""High school's better than juniorhigh.  They'll call you names, but not as much.""  Well, that's surereassuring.       The film is filled with strong acting by even minor characters,including Victoria Davis as Lolita, Christina Brucato as Cookie,Brendan Sexton Jr. as Brandon McCarthy, Telly Pontidis as Jed, HerbieDuarte as Lance, and Scott Coogan as Troy.  The acting by the leads iseven better.  Daria Kalinina is excellent as a supercilious brat.Angela Pietropinto is a perfect mother from hell to the daughter shewished she didn't have.  Matthew Faber has pompous obnoxiousness downpat.       The reason for the overwhelming success of the picture comes fromtwo factors.  The first is the acting by Heather Matarazzo.  In asingle performance she is able to embody all of the fears we had inthat dark era we know as childhood.  So much of her acting is perfect,right down to the way she carries herself.  She acts like her glassesare not quite strong enough, and, in addition, she must avoid beingseen, the net result is she kind of slinks around the school.  Althoughbarraged with insults, Heather breathes an inner strength into hercharacter and shows that underneath her character sees herself as aradical.  In the press kit, the director said that he feared ""thatHeather would lost interest in the movie after she discovered howtedious and dreary the film production process is and tell her mothermidway she'd rather enroll in basketball camp (her original summerplans).""       The second, and most important reason, the show works somarvelously is Todd Solondz.  He wrote, directed, and produced thefilm.  This first time film maker has come up with a show that critics,including yours truly, say will certainly be on their best films of theyear list.  The script is intelligent, funny, poignant, and wise.Although sometimes shocking, it is never manipulative.  The directorsaid of the casting that ""Although there is no sex, nudity, or violencein the movie, many parents were reluctant, if not unwilling, to allowtheir children to participate in the film.""  He said that some parentsfound the film ""unsettling"" or ""depressing"" which he ""took as acompliment as that reflected the world he was trying to portray.Unfortunately, there were many parents who found the script'delightful' and this had him concerned, particularly when he could seethe frozen smiles on their children.""       The music (Jill Wisoff) is an effective blend of old Tchaikovskyclassical pieces and modern rock ones.  The picture was filmed onlocation in Caldwell and West Caldwell, New Jersey.  We lived in alovely place in New Jersey for many years, and the sets (Susan Block)of typical middle class homes of bad carpet and clutter look realisticand familiar.       WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE flies by at just 1:27 thanks to dead onediting by Alan Oxman.  The film is rated R.  Just as the directorsaid, there is no sex, nudity or violence.  There is some bad languageincluding some uses of the F word.  The main reason for the R ratingprobably is that there is one attempted rape scene.  This can be adisturbing show because of its realism, but it begs to be seen and thehumor dulls some of the pain.  I would like to think that kids as youngas 10 will go see this film, but only with their parents.  Withoutparents, I would only let mature teenagers go.  I was blown away bythis tour de force of a movie, and it will certainly be high up on mybest of the year list.  I give the film my strongest recommendation andaward it a full ****. ",Welcome to the Dollhouse,R,1996,4
937,"    We all know that given a choice, the whole world would like tolive like Americans.  In Iraq didn't the soldiers all throw down theirweapons and the crowd deck the Marines with flowers and candy? Not quite.  In fact the current mixed response of the Iraqi peoplemakes us sit up and consider that not everyone thinks like us. Take the French for example. (Please.)  Nonetheless, there isevidence that at least the British want to be like those of us whoreside in the 50 states.  Just look at Dennie Gordon's movie,""What a Girl Wants,"" which is there to convince the target marketof 9- to 15-year old girls that underneath the skin, everyone inLondon is a Yankee itching to crawl out.  Target marketnotwithstanding, ""What a Girl Wants"" could be just the kind ofmovie that many others want given our current difficult times anddespite its utter predictability and formulaic resolution to every plotturn, Amanda Bynes (from The Amanda Show on TV) holds up the104 minutes just fine.  She's awfully cute and hasn't a dishonestbone in her body, mischievous though she may be at times.     William Douglas Home's play from which this movie has beenfreely adapted was made into a film by Vicente Minnelli starringRex Harrison and Kay Kendall in 1958, more of a drawing-roomcomedy than this less subtle version, but just as Rex and Kaymade the 45-year-old pic enjoyable enough so does Amanda withthe help of handsome Colin Firth as an articulate politician wholoses his ability to speak eloquently when in the presence of a 17-year-old daughter he had never before seen.     This Cinderella fable introduces the ebullient teen DaphneReynolds (Amanda Bynes) to the lap of luxury, inspired by a storytold by her hippie-ish mom Libby (Kelly Preston) of the upper-class boyfriend in London who apparently ditched her beforeDaphne was born.  (To keep the PG rating, Libby and her man gotinformally married in a Bedouin ceremony in Morocco though thelegality is in question.)  Curious Libby, who like every normal lovechild wants to know her biological father, goes to London, whereshowing right off that she's got spunk does not try too hard toenter her dad's estate legally but instead climbs the wall (beforemaking everyone else do the same).  Confronting dad, HenryDashwood (Colin Firth), she works her charm on him sufficientlyto allow him to think of his long-lost girlfriend and to move awayfrom the clutches of his greedy fianc and her conniving daughter,both of whom are eager to fit into his rising political career.     ""What a Girl Wants"" has its poignant moments alternating withuninspired slapstick (Daphne frequently takes a pratfall especiallywhen trying to act like a lady, ha ha) but Gordon's film has itsmoments, particularly when Lady Jocelyn (Eileen Atkins) advisesthe youngster, ""Why fit in when you were born to stand out?""  Wecan see Jocelyn's disappointment: though living in the estate shebelieves her life could have been far happier if she were just anordinary Brit downing ale in the local bar.     Does Daphne find an English boyfriend who, like Jocelyn, tellsher to stop acting snooty and to be herself?  Does Henry gettogether with Libby, neither of whom had found partners despitethe passage of 17 years?  Don't think too hard.  Just take ""What aGirl Wants"" for what it is, a pleasant enough diversion with lots ofcharm and firepower from the gifted Amanda Bynes. ",What A Girl Wants,G,2003,2.5
938," If you've always been curious about exactly what heaven and hell looklike, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME offers some intriguing suggestions. Indirector Vincent Ward's long cinematic sermon on the advantages of amoral life, the movie depicts heaven as a happy, colorful landscapepainting and hell as an eerie, gray, Holocaust graveyard overflowingwith talking heads.  The rarely subtle film shows two dead children from inside their coffinsduring the opening credits. They have died in a car accident, and theirfather will shortly die in another, leaving their mother to grieve forthem all back on earth. Although four years elapse between the two caraccidents, the movie dispenses with them quickly so that it can get tothe heavenly beyond.  The father, Chris Nielsen, is a doctor played by Robin Williams.Annabella Sciorra plays his wife and ""soul mate,"" an artist named Annie.Both are deeply scarred characters who share their troubles with us inalmost every scene. If the movie were involving, it could have been thedowner of the year. Instead, it stays at the level of visual technicalachievements with the figures in it about as real as those in artgallery paintings -- lovely to look at, but nothing to get concernedover.  Cuba Gooding, Jr., first seen only as a blur, plays Albert, Chris'sguide into heaven. Gooding, like the rest of the fine actors, is largelywasted in a movie that works only at an ethereal level. The magical filmis artistically surreal but only sporadically realistic.  The script by Ronald Bass, based on Richard Matheson's novel, could haveused a little more levity and should have given the characters somecredible depth. ""I screwed up,"" Chris says when he sees his dog inheaven. ""I'm in dog heaven."" This delightfully natural humor isregretfully absent in most of the movie.  The story's pop messages include such trite ones as, ""Good people end upin hell because they can't forgive themselves."" (Okay now, let's allforgive ourselves so we will get to pass through the pearly gatessuccessfully. Whew, that's a collective load off our shoulders.)  Once in heaven, Chris is amazed to find that he has walked into one ofhis wife's paintings. The film shows us a heaven that is a blend of  thenineteenth-century landscape paintings of Turner and Cole mixed withimpressionistic touches. Not only is it gorgeous, the paint isn't evendry yet. As though in a heavenly version of WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATEFACTORY, Chris gets to sample the paintings by running through them andsqueezing the flowers in his palms as the paint squirts out. Thesedazzling images are among the loveliest and most innovative Hollywoodhas created in years. With Michael Kamen's dramatic music and YvonneBlake's sumptuous costumes for the afterlife, the film works best whenviewed as grand opera as illustrator Maxfield Parrish might have stagedit.  In the tradition of life-after-death pictures, Chris goes back in anattempt to console his wife on earth. Rather than giving her peace,these unseen visits increase her depression. Eventually she will dietoo, but, through a kind of legal snafu, she ends up in hell. Moralrules, it seems, are filled with fine print. The body of the movie hasMax von Sydow, as a mysterious character called The Tracker, leadingChris on a journey into hell to help Chris find his beloved Annie.  A movie filled with absolutely stunning imagery, it is strangely coldand unengaging despite all its beauty. Still, the pedantic script'stedium is more than offset by the handsomeness of the production. WHATDREAMS MAY COME is a feast for the eyes even if not a particularlyfilling meal for the mind.  WHAT DREAMS MAY COME runs 1:48. It is rated PG-13 for thematic elementsinvolving death, some disturbing images, profanity including the F-wordand brief nudity. The film would be fine for teenagers. ",What Dreams May Come,PG-13,1998,2

Just ask his ex-wife (Lauren Holly) and 15year-old daughter (Ashley Johnson). So when his boss (Alan Alda)chooses a woman (Helen Hunt) as the agency's new Creative Director, ajob he thought he had in his hip pocket, he's chagrined, particularlywhen she gives everyone a pink box full of feminine products,assigning them to come up with ideas. That night, after a hilariousscene in which he's waxing his legs, wriggling into pantyhose, andtrying on a Wonderbra, he's almost electrocuted - but the shock opensup a new world. Suddenly, inexplicably, he can hear what women arethinking - and often what they're musing is what a jerk heis. Thoroughly rattled, he consults a therapist (Bette Midler), whosays when Freud died, he still wondered ""What do women want?"" ""If youknow the answer, you can rule!"" she tells him. Soon he does, coming upwith clever ideas, stolen from Helen Hunt's mind, astounding everyoneabout how sensitive and perceptive he's become. And so it goes. MelGibson is sensational: captivating when he's dancing to Sinatra'smusic and charming when he's poking fun at his own manlyimage.

There's also sex, politics and prejudice on themenu, along with philandering husbands, stressed-out wives, prodigalsons, rebellious daughters, meddling grandparents, plus estranged andjust plain strange relatives.

Under the kaleidoscopic direction of Britishfilm-maker Gurinder Chada (""Bhaji on the Beach""), who wrote thescreenplay with Paul Mayeda Berges, the excellent and extensiveensemble cast includes Alfre Woodard, Julianna Margulies, KyraSedgwick, Joan Chen, Mercedes Ruehl, and Maury Chaykin. Unlike JodieFoster's ""Home for the Holidays"" (1995) about a dysfunctional family,these frustrated pilgrims are simply coping with the all-too-realproblems within the contemporary American melting-pot of cultures -even if, at times, the flavorful syrup spills over into contrivedcliches, stereotypes and sentimentality.

There is a 20 second clip of anarchitecturally interesting courthouse.  The rest of the show is eitherboring or unbearably depressing.  The first 60 minutes of the show tookat least 3 hours.  If I had been by myself, I would have walked outafter 30 minutes tops.  I felt the movie actually get worse as it wentalong.       Let me see if it is possible to chronicle some of the things Ihated about this movie.  Depp slept through it.  [Wish I had!]  He wasclearly under heavy sedation at all times.  He reminded the audienceagain and again about how lovely his mother used to be before she gotto be a ""beached whale"" as he described her.  He would take the localkids over to see his mother from a window like a barker at a side show.What a great kid!       A lot of the movie was devoted to the boy with a body of an 18year old but the mind of a 3 year old and whether he would live to seehis next birthday.  The way it was handled ranged from fairlydepressing to very depressing.       I did not care about any of the characters and got to hoping for aswarm of locus to sweep the plains and kill them all off so we couldget a fresh set of actors.  Sad to report that no such swarm appeared.       WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE runs an exhausting 1:58 due to sloppyediting by Andrew Mondshein.  It is rated PG-13.  For an excellent jobof acting by DiCaprio I generously award the show one half of a star,give it a big thumbs down.

The latter, while it isn't particularlyfunny, may not even be the worst comedy of the week.  (THE ANIMAL screenslater this week.) In this anti-buddy comedy, Martin Lawrence plays thief Kevin Caffery, aself-described ""connoisseur of all things portable,"" and Danny DeVito playsMax Fairbanks, a shady billionaire who is currently running a big bankruptcyscam.  Max is the obnoxious sort who is currently shagging Miss September onthe sly and who calls women a stream of endearments from ""sugar cakes"" to""snuggle bunny.""  (What has happened to old reliable DeVito?  His previous 2films, DROWNING MONA and the aptly named SCREWED, were perfectly awful.) Their game of mutual payback begins when Max robs Kevin of the ring that hisgirlfriend, Amber Belhaven (Carmen Ejogo), has just given him.  Max feels noguilt since Kevin has just robbed one of Max's mansions.  Kevin, hissidekick Berger (John Leguizamo) and the rest of Kevin's friends then setout to steal more from Max, all the while trying to retrieve Amber's ring.   Typical of the story's gags is Kevin's inability to tell a lie withoutblinking.  Sam Weisman (THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS), who directs with ham handedobviousness, has Lawrence exaggerate his blinking like a stage actor whoneeds to make sure that even those audience members way back in the cheapseats can still see his gestures. In a story full of bizarre characters, none is more so than Detective AlexTardio (William Fichtner, THE PERFECT STORM).  Prissing around in shades ofwhite from his big blonde hair to his light colored alligator boots, thedetective is pulled along by his three snow white poodles.  Just in case thevisuals aren't enough to have you in stitches, the dogs turn out to have amajor flatulence problem. This juvenile comedy, with its recycled humor that seems always aimedsquarely at kids around 12 or so, does have one truly funny scene.  As Maxtestifies before a Senate committee, Kevin calls him on his cell phone andbegins to harass him.  This causes Max to unleash a stream of expletives.The television camera bleeps it all out, but the sign language translatorrelishes her big opportunity to ad lib with some obvious but nonethelesshilarious gestures.   WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN? runs 1:35.

This is a frighteningshow and not a fun one.  The script by Ronald Bass and Al Franken goesfor the jugular in many of the scenes.  A very honest portrayal ofalcoholic and her loved ones.       The movie starts with the signs of alcoholism starting to rear itsugly head, but with many good times for Meg as she gets high and doeslots of wild and crazy things.  Soon, however, Meg is in the depths ofher addition and it rules her life.  She lives to drink.  Her husbandis oblivious to most of her problems as she can hid it so well.Halfway through the movie she does get treatment and gives up drinking,and then her life gets even worse for quite a while.  She was angry anddepressed while drinking, but even more so when she stops.  Except withher recovered addicts, she is unbearable to be around.       This is a unhappy tale which focuses as much if not more on thehusband of the alcoholic than on the alcoholic herself.  When she wasdrinking, he had a role in her life as her (unsuccessful) savior.  Onceshe gives up drinking, his purpose goes as well.       This is only show I can remember where they smoked, and it madesense for them to do so.  It seems that many alcoholics trade booze forchain smoking as a lesser evil. ",When a Man Loves a Woman,R,1994,3.5
944,"Attention, Wal-Mart Shoppers! Princess Amidala's been sleepingin your store. Well, not exactly, but in this chick's flick NataliePortman plays a poor, pregnant 17 year-old named Novalee Nation whomoves into an Oklahoma Wal-Mart when her wannabe musician/boyfriend,Willie Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno), abandons her. In the discountchain-store, she finds everything she needs. She sleeps in a sleepingbag on a fake lawn, bathes in the bathroom, and keeps careful recordof everything she's used so she can pay it back some day. And when herdaughter, Americus, is born she's celebrated in the media as ""theWall-Mart Baby.""  Intrigued by her celebrity, Novalee's dysfunctionalmother (Sally Field) appears and makes off with some cash. So what'sthe girl gonna do? Like the Beatles' song - she gets a little helpfrom her friends. Like a perpetually pregnant maternity nurse (AshleyJudd), who become her best-friend, and a nurturing surrogate-mother(Stockard Channing). Novalee even finds a fella, a shy, gentlelibrarian (James Frain), and an empowering career as aphotographer. But then Willie Jack resurfaces as country singer BillyShadow, now the protege of a Nashville agent (Joan Cusack). Based onBillie Letts' 1996 best-seller, adapted for the screen by Lowell Ganz& Babaloo Mandel, and directed by Matt Williams (TV's ""Roseanne,""""Home Improvement""), this episodic story of love and the meaning offamily unfolds in a relentlessly likable, sudsy soap operastyle. While Natalie Portman is obviously a sophisticated, refined andtalented actress, she's woefully miscast as raw Southern trash, whichis the way her role is described. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to10, ""Where the Heart Is"" is a sweetly banal, schmaltzy 5, just thenumber that Novalee considers ominous. ",Where the Heart Is,PG-13,2000,2
945,"      WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is a gem of a movie.  It tells the tale ofa lonely Chicago subway toll collector named Lucy (Sandra Bullock).She dreams of speaking to a dashingly handsome guy called PeterCallahan (Peter Gallagher) who passes by her tollbooth every daywithout speaking.  She lives in a small apartment and her conversationsconsist of talking to her cat or to local nominal ladies' man andactual slimeball called Joe Jr. (Michael Rispoli).       One cold Christmas day Peter speaks to her, but her mouth turns tomush and she is unable to respond.  An unhappy series of events turnsher would be lover into a vegetable.  While Lucy is checking on him inhis comatose state in the hospital, his family (Peter Boyle, GlynisJohns, Micole Mercurio, et. al.) decides that Lucy is Peter's fiance.She is going to tell them the truth, but she falls in love with thewhole family and can not bring herself to do it.  Jack Warden playsPeter's godfather and the only one who knows Lucy's secret.       The problems really set in when Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pulman)arrives.  He suspects Lucy may be a fraud since she is a brunette andnot Peter's type.  Peter's real girlfriend, Ashley Baily Bacon (AllyWalker) is blond and is a hell-on-wheels type who, as the movieevolves, keeps calling and leaving messages on Peter's answeringmachine.       WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is a romantic comedy and although there istension and suspense about when Peter will wake up and what will hesay, it is of minor importance.  The real story is the developing lovebetween Lucy and Jack.  Pullman plays Jack as a shy and unassertivecharacter who is not quite sure of what to make of Lucy.  Bullock playsLucy as a captivating woman with a winsome smile, but one that youbelieve might work all day at a tollbooth while dreaming of her PrinceCharming.  The chemistry between Lucy and Jack develops slowly andnaturally as it would with reserved characters of that sort in reallife.  Rather than kiss they do some serious ""leaning"" as they call itin the movie.       The writing by Fred Lebow and Dan Sullivan is marvelous.  On theone hand we have a romance that comes alive.  On the other hand, wehave a comedy full of so many great lines that the audience was in aconstant state of mirth.  My favorite and the audience's was when thefamily asked Lucy to prove that she really was Peter's fiance.  Youwill have to see the movie to find out how she proved it.  The writersalso did something unusual.  They put in many scenes that were notlinked to any other part of the movie.  They were there solely toprovide some good laughs, and they all worked.  My favorite was thepaperboy on the ice.       The cast did real ensemble acting.  It was as if the cast actuallywas a family.  Even the character of Joe Jr., I thought was well done,and I generally detest characters like that in the movies.  Onecharacter I wish I had seen more of was the original girlfriend.  Hercharacter was so outlandish relative to the sweetness of the othersthat I wanted to see what she was going to do next.       The coldness of Chicago in winter was a good metaphor for theloneliness of Lucy's life.  The scene of the snow around the Callahanfamily home on the other hand looked so Norman Rockwell and soothing.Quite a contrast.  Well done sets by Garreth Stover and beautifulcinematography by Phedon Papamichael.  I found myself wondering howeverwhy they released what was clearly a Christmas movie in April. ",While You Were Sleeping,PG,1995,2.5
946," How's this for an original concept?  A bunch of young adult males spend their time hitting on women for sex and then lying among themselves later about their exploits.  Pretty tired.  The only possible twist in writer/director/producer Peter M. Cohen's WHIPPED is whether the women are as innocent and vulnerable as they seem or whether they are scamming the men just like they are being scammed.  The twist, of course, is no twist at all since anyone with any intelligence whatsoever can guess it.  All of this might be ignored if there was good acting or a bright script.  WHIPPED, however, features some of the worst acting this side of a high school play.  The movie, which badly wants to be a THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY version of DINER, has a script that is disgustingly crude but almost never funny.  Its repulsive humor includes anal-oral sex on someone who suffers from diarrhea.  The talented Farrelly brothers might find a way to make this scene work, but Cohen is in no danger of being mistaken for a third Farrelly brother.  The film's four obnoxious fellows like to hang out at their favorite diner and talk dirty -- very dirty and very loud.  Their shoot their favorite questions at each other -- ""Did you nail her?""  ""Did you stuff her?"" -- with salivating coarseness.  The movie's harsh sound makes listening to them about as enjoyable as enduring a heavy rainstorm under a cheap metal roof.  The leader of the pack and the self-described ""good catch"" is named Brad (Brian Van Holt).  He is a broker with an electronic stock ticker over his bed.  Zeke (Zorie Barber) is a martial arts type who likes to buy extra-large-sized condoms although he needs extra small.  Told that he needs to be nice to women, he replies with ""Man, that sucks!""  Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams), called ""fag boy"" by the others, is an obsessive masturbator who worries that we might think he is gay.  He carefully dispels this notion by confiding to the camera that he isn't homosexual and is just more in touch with his feminine side than his friends.  The odd-man out is the constantly blinking Eric (Judah Domke), an unhappily married guy.  He was in charge of ""jumping on the grenade"" when the four of them used to cruise bars looking for chicks.  He would jump on the ugliest one to save the other guys.  He married one of these ""grenades"" and now relegates himself to using various pieces of kitchen cutlery to spice up their sex life.  Mel, who is the proud owner of a 5-speed that's not a bicycle, meets and falls for each of the guys, except Eric.  In the first act, the men talk about her constantly but somehow never manage to mention her name so that they don't realize that they are dating the same woman.  In the second act, they find out but still keep dating her.  And in the third and final act, their situation gets resolved exactly as you would expect.  Consider what this movie teaches the teenage and young adult audience for which the movie is clearly aimed.  Sex is only something to be ""scammed"" from someone and to be snickered at.  The movie reinforces this by making the sex acts themselves happen fast and under cover.  After making sex so filthy, they certainly wouldn't want to show it to us.  The act of love is considerably cheapened by this film without any comedic payoff in return.  Our packed audience, which had just the right demographics for the picture, produced only sporadic and scattered laugher.  On a more positive note.  The film is short -- albeit not near short enough.  WHIPPED runs 1:25.  It is rated R for strong sexual content and language and would be acceptable for college students and older. ",Whipped,R,2000,1
947,"Mere days after describing ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" as ""astupid comedy made smart"" through its witty, enthusiastic hold onthe material and sterling comic timing, along comes ""White Chicks,""a broad comedy that is even more stupid but not nearly as smart. Directedby Keenen Ivory Wayans, the film is too reminiscent of 2001's ""ScaryMovie 2"" (Wayans' last feature) for comfort; yes, there are some big„evengiant„laugh-inducing moments, but they are threaded unevenly througha series of barely cohesive set-pieces posing as a narrative. Theplot and most of the characters' actions, as is, are simply incomprehensible.This is one ribald cinematic effort that could have used another extensive rewrite. In order to prove to their boss (Frankie Faison) and coworkers thatthey have what it takes in the line of duty, African-American FBIagents Marcus (Marlon Wayans) and Kevin Copeland (Shawn Wayans) goundercover„with the help of a lot of latex and make-up„as white hotelheiresses and Hamptons socialites Tiffany (Anne Dudek) and BrittanyWilson (Maitland Ward). Their goal: to investigate a kidnapping plotthat they suspect is about to go down. In the process, Marcus andKevin must convince Tiffany and Brittany's friends, Karen (Busy Philipps),Tori (Jessica Cauffiel), and Lisa (Jennifer Carpenter), of their falseidentities, while keeping the rest of the media and high society atbay. And as Kevin (out of costume) meets and falls for news reporterDenise Porter (Rochelle Aytes) even as he deceives her, the marriedMarcus (as Tiffany) must fend off the relentless advances of bodybuilderDarnell (Terry Crews). ""White Chicks"" takes the concept of 2002's much better ""Sorority Boys""„thatof men posing as women„and ups the ante by having black men playingwhite women. Such a premise is exciting at the onset because of itsinfinite comedic possibilities and, indeed, there are a handful ofwild, laugh-out-loud moments. An ongoing joke concerning Vanessa Carlton's""1000 Miles"" is milked for all its worth, while a hip-hop dance-offbetween Marcus and Kevin (as Tiffany and Brittany) and their stuck-uprivals, Heather (Jaime King) and Megan Vandergeld (Brittany Daniel),is humorously inspired. In addition, a date that Marcus is forcedto go out on with Darnell is memorably outrageous, and in a good way.Otherwise, director Keenen Ivory Wayans relies heavily on the part-bizarre/part-hilariousvisual of this cross-dressing pair to garner the majority of laughs.He succeeds some of the time because Marlon and Shawn Wayans (pairedup again after 2000's ""Scary Movie"" and 2001' ""Scary Movie 2"") aresuch uninhibited performers and their transformation into white womenis realistically pulled off through some amazing make-up work. Thesight of them is funny in and of itself, at first, but when the noveltyof that wears off there is little left to work with. The screenplay, credited to a ridiculous six writers (including thethree Wayans'), is akin to a terrible car wreck, mangled by clumsycharacterizations and poor plotting. Until Marcus and Kevin go undercoveras Tiffany and Brittany, the pace is stagnant and the laughs are nonexistent.The ensemble, which includes no less than sixteen major players, isoverstuffed, with no one (not even Marcus and Kevin) given enoughtime to develop into clearly defined individuals. This glaring problemis cause for embarrassment when the tone turns serious in the third-actand wants us to actually care about these people and the fate of certainrelationships. As the music score swells, orchestrated by Teddy Castellucci(2004's ""50 First Dates"") with such maudlin strings that the scenesunintentionally come off as dramatic parodies, the film becomes alaughing-stock for all the wrong reasons. And as for the ""plot"" (aterm to be used lightly with this movie), anyone who can follow thewhole kidnapping scenario and the motives behind it deserve awardsas they leave the theater. In terms of performance and laughs, ""White Chicks"" is adequate. Allof the actors do what is required of them in one-dimensional rolesthat do them no favors in return, while there is enough to ticklethe viewer's funny bone so that the experience isn't a painful one.Still, with about five different sequences hinging on fart jokes aloneand no sense to be made of the plot specifics, it is safe to say thelazy writing doesn't even begin to approach what might have been withsuch a creative premise. Unlike the current ""Dodgeball,"" which wasambitious enough to be a sharp satire besides a broad physical comedy,""White Chicks"" has a witless one-track mind. Director Keenen IvoryWayans and actor brothers Shawn and Marlon were so enamored with theidea behind their film that they neglected to create anything worthwhile around it. ",White Chicks,PG-13,2004,2
948,"Alternative history is a concept rarely used in movies, and not only because it requires larger budgets and more inventive screenwriting in order to realistically create alternate words. It is rarely used because many people simply can't grasp it. One of such instances happened in Croatia when WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, 1995 science fiction drama written and directed by Desmond Nakano, came into local video stores. The distributor advertised the film as being set in ""near future"".  The plot of the film is actually set in present day, but that present day is in alternative America where the position of races is reversed. Blacks are affluent majority, while whites are impoverished minority, forced to live in inner-city ghettos in vicious cycle of violence, poverty and always confronted with prejudice. Louis Pinnock (played by John Travolta) is white factory worker who tries to do the right thing and provide good life for his family. In order to earn some extra cash he volunteers to deliver package to the house of Thaddeus Thomas (played by Harry Belafonte), black CEO. There he accidentally glimpses Thomas' wife Megan (played by Margaret Avery) coming under shower and gets mistaken for a voyeur. This misunderstanding has disastrous consequences for Pinnock - he loses job, gets beaten by black cops and his family gets evicted. In despair, Pinnock decides to kidnap Thomas and demand justice.  Desmond Nakano is Japanese American and as such he was probably more qualified to comment on the state of black-white relations in 1990s America. Those relations became big issue after Los Angeles riots and O.J. Simpson affair. Nakano's observations are quite interesting, especially in the first part of the film when we watch usual racial stereotypes in reverse - whites seen as potential rapists, criminals; media dominated by black faces as embodiment of beauty; black cops harassing white leaving in inner-cities etc. However, the novelty quickly wears off and it soon becomes apparent that Nakano's view of present-day America is too simplistic - affluent blacks are today much more common sight than they used to be some forty years ago and anyone who watches JERRY SPRINGER SHOW knows that poverty doesn't recognise racial boundaries. In the second part the film degenerates into cliches when Thaddeus and Louis start to befriend each other and have to dodge police bullets. Travolta and Belafonte, however, play their roles superbly and improve the general impression of this film. WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, although it could have been much better, serves its purpose by allowing the audience to see some banal facts of life from thought-provoking perspective. ",White Man's Burden,R,1995,2.5
949,"One of the key conceits that ""White Oleander,"" like 1999's underrated""Anywhere But Here"" before it, gets exactly right is the inextricablebond between parent and child. As a child, you are raised to becomea certain kind of person with similar values to your parents or guardians,and in some cases it is easy to forget your own individuality.  Teenager Astrid Magnussen (Alison Lohman) is a young woman who fallsvictim to this very curse. When her intense, free-thinking artistmom, Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), is convicted of murdering a cheatingboyfriend (Billy Connolly), Astrid finds herself at the mercy of theadoption agency, where she experiences three different foster families.Her first stay is with trailer trash born-again Christian Starr (RobinWright Penn), who grows jealous of Astrid when she begins spendingtime with Starr's live-in boyfriend (Cole Hauser). Her second stopis her happiest, and most tragic, with struggling actress Claire Richards(Renee Zellweger) taking Astrid under her wing. They quickly becomethe best of friends, until a meeting with Ingrid in prison causesdrastic changes. Finally, Astrid chooses to stay with Rena (SvetlanaEfremova), a Russian woman who earns money at flea markets and turnsher children into trash-pickers. All the while, the easily influencedAstrid finds herself t! ransformed by three wildly diverse and troubledmother figures, and a possessive blood mother who refuses to apologizefor the decisions she's made in her own life. Based on the novel by Janet Fitch (an Oprah Book of the Month winner),""White Oleander"" is not the feminist, melodramatic weeper one mightexpect. The central themes involving familial relationships are universal,and director Peter Kosminsky and screenwriter Mary Agnes Donoghuecapture them with a powerful understatement that chooses to earn itstears rather than strain for them. Janet Fitch's source material had Astrid visiting five foster families,while, in the interest of time, this cinematic adaptation cuts itto three. Moving from one set of characters to the next roughly everyhalf hour threatens to give the film an episodic feel, but this direpossibility mostly dissipates when Kosminsky and Donoghue successfullyspend enough time in each setting for the viewer to be engrossed andtouched by their appearances. In a demandingly auspicious big-screen debut, Alison Lohman (who hada bit part in 1999's ""The Thirteenth Floor"") is the one constant in""White Oleander."" Acting as the viewer's tour guide and put-upon heroinewho goes through a startling metamorphosis from trusting child towise young woman, Lohman is exceptional. Supporting her is one tremendousco-star after the next. Michelle Pfeiffer (2001's ""I Am Sam"") injectsher difficult Ingrid with a stirring determination and an uncompromisinghonesty. When Ingrid and Astrid occasionally reunite for visits, allone can do is recoil in fear at the harsh words Ingrid may speak.Pfeiffer has never, or rarely, been better. As a fellow orphan andearnest artist Astrid befriends named Peter, Patrick Fugit (2000's""Almost Famous"") tuns in strong supporting work, as does Cole Hauser(2002's ""Hart's War""), as Starr's nice-guy boyfriend who briefly becomesAstrid's sole father figure. Special notice deserves to go to Renee Zellweger (2001's ""BridgetJones's Diary""), an always-marvelous performer who here, as the kind-but-troubledClaire Richards, gives a particularly unforgettable, courageous turn.Claire is initially set up as an ideal, caring mother for Astrid,and the many layers Zellweger gradually peels to uncover a woman whois really in sheer mental pain is startling and nothing short of heartbreaking.Claire has an indelible effect on Astrid's life, and the way in whichshe does is aided immeasurably by Zellweger's involvement. The conclusion of ""White Oleander,"" like most of what has comebefore, is poignant without turning into a sapfest, and subtle whenit could have more easily been overwrought. Despite a confused notionover a ""sacrifice"" Ingrid makes for Astrid, the film is affectingand rather weighty for mainstream fare. Even when certain plot developmentsare hinted at, then unevenly passed over (no doubt a victim to thePG-13 rating when an R would have strengthened the realism of thesituations), the exemplary performances across the board never oncedisappoint. For an adaptation of a sprawling novel with a lot of territoryto cover in 109 minutes, ""White Oleander"" is a surprisingly mature and satisfying drama.",White Oleander,PG-13,2002,2.5
950,"      Now here is a concept for a movie, how about DEAD POETS' SOCIETYGOES TO SEA?  So you are not enthralled?  Well, too bad, that movie hasbeen produced, and it is called WHITE SQUALL.  This is a movie thatshould have never been made.  It is a low quality rehash of the classicteaching high school kids movie that has been made more times than Ican count.  This picture has nothing original to say, and the acting isway below par.  Imagine making a show about kids and then not puttingin a single kid (or adult for that matter) that you care about.       WHITE SQUALL is based on a true story that occurred in 1960.  Abunch of high school students elect to have their senior year aboard asailing ship called the Albatross.  The ship will travel the Caribbeanwhere the students will learn sailing as well as English and Biology.Most of all, thanks to the stern and sadistic Captain ChristopherSheldon (Jeff Bridges), they will learn self-reliance.  CaptainSheldon's wife, Alice (Caroline Goodall), is the ship's doctor and theboys' biology teacher.  The other older people on the boat are anEnglish teacher, Mr. McCrea (John Savage), and a cook, Girard Pascal(Julio Mechoso).       There must have been a dozen or so boys.  They include Chuck Gieg,whom I thought must have been Tom Cruse's brother, but actually turnedout to be played by Scott Wolf, Tod (Balthazar Getty), Frank (JeremySisto), Preston (Eric Michael Cole), and the canonical tough kid namedGil Martin (Ryan Phillipe).       The Captain alternates between berating the boys to inspiring themwith little homilies such as, ""If we don't have order, we have nothing.Where we go one, we go all.""  In a typical scene, we have a boy who hasa deadly fear of heights so the Captain forces him to climb high up themasks while they both yell at each other making the sounds of wildanimals.  We also learn that sailing is a dangerous activity.  From thebeginning people get hanged by getting caught in the ropes, they getthrown overboard in high seas, and in general death is around everycorner.  Sailing was not like this in my day.  Guess it got a saferquickly since 1960.       The derivative script by Todd Robinson is filled with cliches.The boys go into town and in a scene straight out of PORKY'S, they renta prostitute for the most inexperience boy.  They fight a lot too.When girls come aboard the ship, the boys claim no knowledge of whatthey would say to a girl.  Sure.  Another kid keeps hitting himself inthe head and crying while repeating, ""I'm a moron,"" because he ishaving trouble learning a subject.  Another shoots a dauphin justbecause.  There is not much of a story really just a series of almostunrelated and completely trivial incidents.  I will not give awayanymore other than to say they did not choose the title of the movie atrandom.       There is no chemistry among the boys or among anyone else in thecast.  There is not a single decent acting job by any of the boys.None of the characters are acted believably thanks to poor direction byRidley Scott.  I know it is a true story, but somehow I do not thinkthe kids were really this boring or the Captain this mean.  Bridges'sperformance is especially pathetic.  He never warms up to the part andseems to be spaced out in most of the scenes as if he wishes he weresomewhere else rather than in this film.  Perhaps he was suffering fromsunstroke during the filming.       The cinematography (HUGH JOHNSON) is full of dark blues and greenswith heavy use of shadows to create an overbearing feeling of impendingtragedy and doom.  Sometimes they use extreme close-ups for reasons Icould not figure out.       There is a single good part of this movie.  It starts on thelovely out of the way island of St. Vincent, and as they sail away forthe first time, you get a beautiful shot of tiny Young Island right offSt. Vincent.  Since my wife and I spent eleven wonderful ten dayThanksgiving Holidays in a row there, it brought back wonderful imagesto my brain.  Too bad we have not been there in years, but the movieserved as a one minute travelogue for me.  Now, that is it; there isnothing else worth seeing in this film. ",White Squall,PG-13,1996,0.5
951,"What do writer-directors  look for in a caper movie?  If the caper involves the theft of jewels as is the case with Chris Ver Wiel's ""Who is Cletis Tout?"", they'd look for inspiration to the king of the genre, Jules Dassin's ""Topkapi"" about would-be thieves who plan the perfect crime in an Istanbul museum. ""Topkapi"" had thrills, derring-do, and featured well-directed roles for major talent like Melina Mercouri, Peter Ustinov, Robert Morley and Maximilian Schell.  ""Cletis Tout"" has some top talent as well, but while Ver Wiel's production is diverting enough, the plot is a mixed bag lacking the chills of a boldly-conceived robbery, a strong sense of comic timing, and a convincing love story.      A tale of mistaken identity that almost lands Finch (Christian Slater) in the morgue, ""Who is Cletis Tout"" opens in the present time.  Hitman Critical Jim (Tim Allen), whose hobby when not killing people for money is watching classic films and memorizing the wittiest lines, holds Finch hostage, with instructions to the mobsters who hired him that his fee must be transferred to his bank account within 90 minutes of he lets his victim go.  Since the money is no problem, Finch has the burden of talking Jim out of the hit.  Latching on to Critical Jim's love for the cinema, he describes the plot of a intriguing potential movie based on his own experiences, which begin in 1977 when he meets the perpetrator of a botched diamond heist, Micah (Richard Dreyfuss), in a North Carolina maximum security prison.  Micah has been sent up for forgery, a skill that serves the two jail birds after their escape, as they hook up with Micah's now-grown daughter, Tess (Portia De Rossi)--who takes an immediate dislike to Finch.       For Critical Jim to buy the proposed film and thereby let Finch escape from his clutches, he insists that Finch give the audience what they want: a jewel heist, a prison break and a girl all of which he gets. One trouble with the proposal as acted out by the characters described in the room is that there is little chemistry between Tess and Finch. Her distaste for the man she has just met and who has offended her is not convincing, nor is their mutual attraction thereafter. Yet another is that the comic genius of Billy Connolly in the role of a corrupt coroner, Dr. Savian, is underutilized.  Richard Dreyfus seems uncomfortable with his alarmingly small role as the diamond thief whose days are numbered, and the two stooges who are hired as hitmen, Nimble (Louis Di Bianco) and Fife (Tony Nappo) might have been funny in the forties but are not amusing in a contemporary comedy.  The biggest embarrassment of all is RuPaul as a drag queen who seems to have entered from another movie.  Ver Wiel must have been thinking that an audience might still laugh at the stereotypical antics of such a character.  ""Who is Cletis Tout"" is not destined to be the kind of movie that a lover of the classics like Critical Jim would consider viewing.  ",Who Is Cletis Tout?,R,2002,2
952,"It is gravely doubtful that there is a single person on the planetwho wished for a sequel to 2000's marginal mob comedy sleeper ""TheWhole Nine Yards."" Nevertheless, here it is, a long four years laterand its only reason for being to cash some paychecks. Witlessly directedby Howard Deutch (who, during the '80s, was responsible for two greatJohn Hughes teen flicks, ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful""),""The Whole Ten Yards"" is deplorable filmmaking from its first frameto the last, a laugh-free comedy overcome by an unintelligible plotand needlessly unpleasant mean streak running straight through itscarcass. Worse yet, the film fails to offer up a single reason for its very existence. For those a little foggy on the plot particulars of ""The Whole NineYards,"" it is understandable; The movie, although a veritable ""Gandhi""in comparison to this continuation, was a forgettable time-wasterwhose only claim to notoriety was its offbeat pairing of Bruce Willis(2000's ""Unbreakable""), as an infamous contract killer looking tosettle down, and Matthew Perry (2002's ""Serving Sara""), as a suburbandentist horrified when Willis moves in next door to him. ""The WholeTen Yards"" isn't so much a harmless time-waster as it is a vicioustime-stealer, a worthless disgrace of a sequel whose plot forgoesnarrative cohesion in exchange for a flimsy excuse simply to reunitethe same cast of imbecilic characters. Things are picked up a few years after the predecessor, with Jimmy'The Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis) and wife Jill (Amanda Peet) experiencingmarital woes at their new Mexico home.

953,"Traditionally, the last few weeks of summer trigger the release of an avalanche of weak films from the major studios, as the powers that be desperately try to squeeze whatever money they can from moviegoers still hungry for air-conditioned diversion. While most of these leftovers lack ideas or a distinctive point of view, ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"" suffers from the opposite problem. Presenting the biography of singer Frankie Lymon, writer Tina Andrews and director Gregory Nava juggle too many ideas and points of view, resulting in a film that, while sporadically entertaining, mostly serves as a frustrating example of disjointed storytelling and missed opportunities.  The film prominently features a court battle between three women over the estate of Lymon, their late husband. Beneath that elaborate framing device lies your basic rags-to-riches-to-disaster pop music tale. Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers hit the big-time in the late '50s with the film's title song, a catchy doo-wop number which remains a staple of oldies stations. Lymon became a star and went solo, falling into a life of womanizing and drugs, leading towards the inevitable downfall.   We've seen variations of this story before (in ""The Buddy Holly Story,"" ""La Bamba"" and ""The Doors,"" to name just a few), but Lymon's situation contains relatively fresh thematic potential. The phenomenon of rock and roll was manufactured by white businessmen by stealing rhythm and blues from the people who created it. For years, they made stars of white singers covering songs originally written and performed by black artists. When black performers were finally allowed to take their place in the mainstream spotlight, it was only under the rigid control of white management.   Lymon was one of many artists marginalized due to race. Having achieved fame against the odds, he then found his star fading as the '60s British Invasion hit, making all other forms of music pass_. Once again, young white kids ruled the charts with sounds derived from black musicians. ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"" becomes quite interesting when examining this theme. Indeed, one of the film's most poignant scenes comes on the stage of the pop music show ""Hullabaloo,"" as Lymon stands in the wings, staring in astonishment as The Kinks perform before a screaming crowd, while he waits to appear as an ""oldies"" act.  Lymon's attempts to maintain a career in an entertainment world where race and rapidly changing musical tastes work against him makes compelling viewing, but the production only devotes a few minutes to that. Director Nava is so busy navigating through the film's convoluted structure that he fails to deal with the issues raised by the story. The women's court battle should have been a mere framing device, but instead it takes over the film. In the height of irony, Frankie Lymon becomes a marginal figure in his own biography.   Over the course of its 117 minutes, ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"" tries to be several different movies. It's a man-bashing, female bonding flick as the three ex-wives discuss Lymon's flaws. It's a glossy bio-pic using spinning newspapers to flash headlines as it shows Lymon's meteoric climb to stardom in a dreamy retro-world. It's a melodramatic soap opera, showing the singer's abusive behavior as drugs swallow his being. It's a sassy courtroom comedy, with judge Pamela Reed allowing ex-wives Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon to act more like guests on ""The Jerry Springer Show"" than plaintiffs in a court case.  Mostly, it's a superficial mish-mash of styles and tones that frequently entertains, but never fully satisfies. The songs are good and Larenz Tate gives an energetic performance as Lymon. There are a number of effective scenes, and it's a treat watching Little Richard play himself on the witness stand in a memorable cameo, testifying in both the legal and evangelical sense of the word. What a shame that age prevented him from playing himself throughout the film, because the actor portraying Little Richard as a young man is terrible (an actor imitating Redd Foxx and stand-ins for The Kinks are even less convincing).  Structural problems and bad impressionists aside, the fatal flaw is in the framing story itself. By focusing on the ex-wives instead of Lymon, viewers are asked to become emotionally involved with three characters squabbling over a dead man's money. As the film progresses and the women turn increasingly mercenary, sympathizing with their plight becomes extremely difficult. It's like being led outside to see a horse, then being presented with its carcass and urged to cheer for the vultures circling overhead.  At the end of the film, a picture of the real Frankie Lymon appears onscreen and I was struck by two things. First, he looked much younger than the actor who played him and second, after watching a film purportedly devoted to his memory, Frankie Lymon remained a stranger, just another rock and roll casualty, even in his own movie.  ",Why Do Fools Fall In Love,R,1998,2
954,"       WIDOWS' PEAK is a quirky little Irish comedy and mystery from thedirector (John Irvin) of Turtle Diary.  It features Mia Farrow as themysteriously angry, local Irish woman who is convinced that themysterious new English/American stranger, played by Natasha Richardsonis ""up to murder"".       The town is populated by rich widows who live on a hill nicknamedWIDOWS' PEAK.  Joan Plowright plays the matriarch of the women.  All ofthe poor folks live down in the town except for poor widow Farrow whomysteriously lives on the peak.  Adrian Dunbar is Plowright's son, andhe falls head over hills in love with the new stranger.       The movie is pure fluff.  It is rated PG.  They said one mild fourletter word I think to avoid getting the kiss of death of a G ratingwhich most theatergoers thinks means that adults must be accompanied bya child under the age of 6 to attend and must turn off their brain onentering.       Mia Farrow and Natasha Richardson are both a delight to watch.Just quirky enough but never overacting.  Lots of great Irish sceneryin the movie so if you get bored, just ignore the actors and watch thecinematography (Ashley Rowe) of the Irish countryside and town.       There is frankly not much in the movie.  The mystery is fun, butpretty lightweight.  It has a nice ending which is sort of easy toguess.  The script (Hugh Leonard) is lightweight but with a few goodlaughs. ",Widows' Peak,PG,1994,2.5
955,"THE WILD THORNBERRYS MOVIE is the latest in the popular trend of bringingkids' television cartoon series to the big screen.  Many, like HEY ARNOLD!THE MOVIE, lack visual and creative imagination, having only the popularityof the TV show to recommend it.   Kate Boutilier's mediocre script for THE WILD THORNBERRYS MOVIE lacks THERUGRATS' irreverent wit -- both are made by Nickelodeon -- but the movie'svisuals are surprisingly stunning, full of rich colors and with someimpressive images.  Although most of the movie is set in Africa, it is theportion at an English boarding school, much like the French school inMADELINE, where the details of the animation are the loveliest. The series and the movie centers on 12-year-old Eliza Thornberry (voiced byLacey Chabert), a girl with a big secret about her magical powers.  She cantalk with animals, a gift that she will keep so long as she never admits itto other humans.  She and her family are currently traveling across theAfrican savanna in an RV.  Bet you didn't know than a motor home could havethe off-road capabilities of a Hummer.  But, I guess that, if you can buypeople talking to animals, you can accept Winnebagos becoming sport utilityvehicles. Being a kids' movie, you can be sure that the plot will involve some aspectof environmentalism.  Eliza is trying to find and rescue the young cheetahthat some poachers in a helicopter stole from the cheetah's mother.  Therecycled plot doesn't have anything new to say, and it's relatively devoidof effective humor.  Even Eliza's talkative sidekick, a monkey named Darwin(voiced Tom Kane), doesn't get many laughs.  The only completely successfulcharacter is Eliza's sister, Debbie (voiced by Danielle Harris), ahilariously sarcastic teen.  Debbie resents all of the attention paid to heryounger sister just because she keeps getting into trouble.  Debbie, who islike a grownup Rugrat, steals every scene she is in.  Let's hope that nexttime Debbie becomes the star.   THE WILD THORNBERRYS MOVIE runs 1:22.  It is rated PG for ""some adventureperil"" and would be acceptable for all ages. My son Jeffrey, age 13, gave it just one *, saying that he found it boringand predictable.

956,"It is common knowledge that the month of January is a dumping groundfor motion pictures that studios have little faith in; they are usuallynot serious or good enough to be end-of-the-year releases, and notbig enough in scale to battle it out in the summer. ""Win a Date withTad Hamilton!,"" the equivalent of 2003's January romantic comedy ""JustMarried,"" only much better, proves to be an exception to this rule.Directed by Robert Luketic (2001's ""Legally Blonde""), the film isa lightweight concoction, predictable from frame one, but its energeticperformances, sweet-natured tone, and surprisingly savvy Hollywood-aimedhumor carry it painlessly through to the end. Rosalee Futch (Kate Bosworth) is a 22-year-old supermarket cashierwho spends her days hanging out with best friend coworkers Pete (TopherGrace) and Cathy (Ginnifer Goodwin) in their small West Virginia hometown.When she enters a contest to win a date with popular Hollywood actorTad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel), Rosalee realizes her chances are slimto none. But when she wins, and is suddenl y whisked away to Los Angelesto meet her idol, Rosalee's world is turned upside down. Tad, a badboy looking to find redemption and reclaim his humanity, sees Rosaleeas just the person to help him out. Suddenly, Tad has bought a farmin West Virginia and wants very much to be a part of her life. Unbeknownstto Rosalee, her true love has been in front of her the whole time,but Pete has never had the guts to tell her how he feels. Because the outcome is so easily foreseeable, much like most screenromances, what is important is not where the story ends up, but howit gets there. In the case of ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!,"" thebright cast charismatically work off of each other, making the viewer'stime spent with them zippy and always likable. They are aided by asnappy screenplay by Victor Levin, which generates satisfying laughs,a number of quotable lines of dialogue, and only a rare instance ortwo of sappy romantic hokum. A key discussion about a person's numberof different smiles, for example, is well-intentioned but admittedlya bit of an eye-roller. Fortunately, it is evened out by some genuinelyromantic moments, including a final shot that is ingenious in its conception. Where the film most notably breaks out of the generic is in its playfulsatire of both real Hollywood life and a small town's sometimes skewedideas of what a Hollywood life entails. When Rosalee's caring father(Gary Cole) yearns to win over Tad Hamilton by spouting off the currentnews stories he's read from ""Variety,"" it is very funny. And when,later, her dad is seen simply wearing a ""Project Greenlight"" t-shirt,the ongoing joke becomes even more clever and smart because it doesn'tfeel the need to call attention to itself. Dir ector Robert Luketictrusts his audience to understand the comedy in such situations asthese, rather than feeling the need to spoon-feed them down their throats. Following her work in 2002's ""Blue Crush"" and 2003's ""Wonderland,""Kate Bosworth has become a promising young actress to watch. She isadorable as leading lady Rosalee, which is about all that is reallycalled of her to be, but then goes one step further to really createan intelligent three-dimensional person. As the secretly lovestruckPete, everything that needs to be said about the character is toldthrough the look in Topher Grace's (2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"") eyes.His role is seemingly undemanding, but Grace makes us believe thathe is really in love with Rosalee . And feature film newcomer JoshDuhamel (TV's ""Las Vegas"") is exceedingly plausible as Hollywood starTad Hamilton. Kudos to screenwriter Levin for avoiding the often clichedtemptation of turning Tad into a snobbish baddie, and creating a realarc for him. In order to win over Rosalee, Tad must tell a lie, buthe finally recognizes his mistake and learns from it. The supporting players are a varied, scene-stealing bunch. GinniferGoodwin (2003's ""Mona Lisa Smile"") is utterly delightful as Rosalee'speppy best friend, Cathy, bringing both warmth and comic gold to herevery moment. Kathryn Hahn (2003's ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"")also stands out in only a few scenes as Angelica, a wistful bartenderwho harbors a not-so-secret crush on Pete. And Sean Hayes (2003's""Pieces of April"") is quirkily enjoyable as Tad's manager, deservingcredit for once again playing someone who is nothing at all like hisfamed persona as Jack McFarland on TV's ""Will & Grace."" As the first release of 2004, I could think of much worse ways tostart the year than ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"" (such as 2003'suneven ""Just Married,"" 2002's ""Impostor,"" 2001's ""Sugar & Spice,""and 2000's reprehensible ""Next Friday""). Kate Bosworth and TopherGr ace ignite light, but palpable sparks as the romantic leads, andthe movie that surrounds them is well-paced and never less than entertaining.""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"" won't be shaking the world anytimesoon, but it has enough freshness and charm to stand out in the midstof the January humdrums.",Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!,PG-13,2004,2.5
957,"Back in 1942, during W.W.II, 400 patriotic young Americans from theNavajo nation were recruited and trained by the Marines to use their nativelanguage to transmit secret military information. They were dubbed'windtalkers,' a name that evokes their spirituality and culture. Theirmission's success was vital to our victory in the Pacific and theirs was theonly code never broken by the Japanese. Since it was imperative ""to protect thecode at all costs,"" the Marines assigned to watch over the Navajos in combatfaced a provocative moral dilemma: if a Navajo was captured, his Marine escortwould have to kill him rather than have him taken prisoner.     Dour Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is war-weary, suffering serious eardrumdamage and post-traumatic stress. Yet his devotion to duty propels him back intobattling the Japanese in the Saipan invasion, where he's partnered with friendlyyet fearful Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), who transmits radio bulletins from thefront-lines to his pal Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie), who's guarded bygenial Ox Anderson (Christian Slater) - and this latter duo's woodflute-harmonica duets are poignant. Mark Ruffalo, Noah Emmerich, Brian Van Holt,Martin Henderson and Peter Stormare complete the stereotypical platoon. Thehypothetical premise is challenging but writers John Rice & Joe Batteer liftliberally from Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" plus other war movies, andtheir weak, simplistic dialogue is drenched with clich_s. Director John Woostages some harrowing, graphic combat sequences and scores with several solid,suspenseful moments that determine who will survive. On the Granger Movie Gaugeof 1 to 10, ""Windtalkers"" is a compelling 8, revealing and reveling in theingenuity and bravery of these unsung Navajo heroes. ",Windtalkers,R,2002,2.5
958," Chris Roberts's WING COMMANDER is a cinematic black hole that's liableto suck your brains out as you attempt to decipher its impenetrablestory.  First-time director Roberts, who ""directs"" the movie based onhis video game, clearly seems to be working in the wrong medium anddoesn't have much of a clue as to how to stage a motion picture.  WriterKevin Droney, who also adapted MORTAL COMBAT for the big screen, createsa movie so confusing you need a manual to be able to follow it.  You can score the movie as you watch it.  Give yourself 100 points everytime you figure anything out.  And give yourself double if you care.Don't feel bad if you find you can't make a single point as that will bea common score.  Basically we have some young warriors (Freddie Prinze Jr., MatthewLillard and Saffron Burrows) and some veterans (JÙrgen Prochnow, Tch_kyKaryo and David Suchet) who are part of a space armada.  Their motto is""if you die, you never existed.""  As they prepare for battle, the troopsspend their time arguing over the relative merits of estrogen vs.testosterone as being the most important ingredient for a fighter.  The ""special"" effects in the movie are only a small cut above the oldBuck Rogers's serials.  The fighters look like three-inch pieces of oldmetal with Bunsen burners for propellants.  You do have to give the actors credit for keeping a straight facethrough it all, no matter how inane the dialog.  (One of David Suchet'slines, for example, is ""Come on, this is sterile conjecture."")  My son, who is a fairly savvy and generally quiet moviegoer, whisperedto me about a dozen times during the movie to see if I could figure outwhat was happening.  Each time I answered him honestly, ""I have noidea.""  As I was forced to endure this stupefyingly dull film, I began todevelop various theories about it.  Perhaps, the speech was encrypted,and our theater didn't have the right decoder module.  I tried watchingthe actors' mouths move since another theory of mine was that the moviewas originally in a foreign language, and the problem was a bad Englishdubbing.  ""Emotion gets in the way,"" the Wing Commander advises her troops.  Well,the movie doesn't have to worry about emotion.  There isn't a singlecharacter in it that creates one scintilla of interest or sympathy.Don't see the movie; rent the video game instead.

They mentioned to me that theypreferred the five star system and suggested that I return to it.  Iguess if something isn't broken, it shouldn't be fixed, as the oldsaying goes, so, I will return to the five star rating system I amhumbly known for.  An now, on with the review.....  A division of society's classes has always offered the opportunity forgreat film making.  'The Wings of the Dove' is based on the novel by Henry James and isadapted for the screen by Hossein Amini and is set in the Victorian era,1910 to be exact, and tells a very subtle story of poverty's desperationstriving for notoriety and a better way of living.  The book is actuallyset closer to the turn of the century but is moved forward a few yearsto 1910, perhaps as an attempt to show the more slowly erodingtraditions of the 19th century in terms of honour and tradition to thevery different social trends the 20th century would bring.  Two British lovers, Kate and Merton (Helena Bonham Carter and LinusRoache) star in this rather cold yet meaningful study of morality andconscience.  Kate's mother is deceased and her father is a hopelessalcoholic living in the excesses of poverty.  Through the course oftheir relationship in the film, they meet a young American girl namedMillie (Alison Elliott) whom they discover is dying from a disease thatis undisclosed to the audience.  They find that she is quite wealthy.She meets Merton and later asks Kate what kind of man he is since she isaware they know each other but never counting on the plot that isdevised against her by the two of them.  Kate and Merton plot for him tomarry Millie, suspecting and almost certainly counting on the fact thatshe will leave her money to him upon her death and Kate and Merton canfinally be together enjoying a better way of life.  As the film moveson, all the characters eventually know more or less what is happening.  The picture is nurtured and given a very gentle tone courtesy ofdirector Iain Softley who allocates a great amount of detail to theoverall quality and outcome of the film.  Helena Bonham Carter has wonvirtually every major critic's award for this film and she has a goodshot at the Academy Award.  The Victorian era is paid tribute to in a very flattering manner aseverything from the costumes to the set design and the moody photographyis given great attention.  'The Wings of the Dove' runs a surprisingly short 108 minutes butbecause it is such a laid back film with ongoing dialogue that is neverboring and is the type of story that is always interesting to watch, itmay have done its service as a short but satisfying offering to themedium of film.. ",Wings Of The Dove,R,1997,2.5

Take those two notions, mix in the low level of humorof one of Adam Sandler's flat early efforts like 1995's ""Billy Madison,""and out pops ""Without a Paddle,"" a faux-sentimental comedy that notonly isn't funny, but half the time appears to have forgotten to insert the joke. Childhood pals Dan (Seth Green), Jerry (Matthew Lillard), and Tom(Dax Shepard), now 30, are shaken to their cores when the fourth memberof their old quartet, the free-spirited Billy (Anthony Starr), diesin an untimely parasailing accident. Struck by the way time has passedthem by without them having reached a number of their goals and yearningto have one last wild weekend together, Dan, Jerry, and Tom set outinto the Oregon wilderness with a scrappy treasure map in hand. Theirfun-filled canoe trip takes a quick turn for the worse when they losetheir transportation, are attacked by a bear, and are hunted downby a pair of marijuana-growing, backwoods rednecks, Elwood (EthanSuplee) and Dennis (Abraham Benrubi). Amidst it all, the three friendsdiscover that the things they treasure most have been right in front of them all along. Directed by Steven Brill (2002's ""Mr. Deeds""), ""Without a Paddle""is a lugubrious big-screen turkey that can't even hold a candle tothe other recent ""dumb"" comedies of its ilk, like ""Harold and KumarGo to White Castle"" and ""Eurotrip."" Those aforementioned efforts garneredsome hearty laughs and worked occasional smart writing into theirotherwise low-class order of gags. As written by Jay Leggett and MitchRouse, ""Without a Paddle"" is just plain stupid, pandering unsuccessfullyto audiences with one pedestrian comic bit after the other. Its physicalhumor, which ranges from throwing feces onto people's heads from treetopsto getting carried off by a bear and being expected to hibernate withit, is flimsy even by the limited standards of the genre. The one-linersaren't much better, leading the viewer to question how such lame materialmade its way out of the first draft„unless it was the first draftthat was used as the shooting script, a real possibility. Things finallysettle down near the end, but it is in the name of corny, sermonizingtalks about the value of life, all of them unconvincing and none of them inspirational. The three actors who make up the trio„Seth Green (2003's ""The ItalianJob""), Matthew Lillard (2004's ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed""),and Dax Shepard (MTV's ""Punk'd"")„are all adequate and have been goodin the past, but not even the best thespians could save such a hopelessscript from cinematic doom. Mostly, they are asked to play types.Green's Dan is short and a hypochondriac doctor, to boot. Lillard'sJerry is stuck in a boring office job when his real passion is insurfing. He also has a nagging on-and-off girlfriend (Bonnie Sommerville)so intolerably written that it boggles the mind why he would wantto get back with her, and why audiences would want him to. And Shepard'sTom is the outspoken player who lies to his friends in order to maskhis unhappiness in where he stands in his own life. As the bumbling redneck villains hot on their trail, Ethan Suplee(2004's ""The Butterfly Effect"") and Abraham Benrubi (2003's ""OpenRange"") are thoroughly unpleasant in an ongoing subplot that takesup too much screen time and goes nowhere special. They attribute theonly laugh in the whole movie, however, a gag involving '80s groupCulture Club, but it definitely isn't worth suffering through therest to get to. Finally, Burt Reynolds (2001's ""Driven"") adds a touchof class to his small role as mountain-man Del Knox, eliciting somethingin the way of actual character weight to a part that was likely meantto be little more than a stereotype. ""Without a Paddle"" attempts to be nostalgic in its portrait of threefriends reminiscing about their childhood„an '80s song here, a ""StarWars"" action figure there„but all angles of said subject have beencaptured with far more accuracy and depth in countless past cinematicwalks down memory lane. Mostly, ""Without a Paddle"" is content to reachfor puerile, tone-deaf comedy sketches and virtual stick figures posingas real people with real problems. When it reaches for schmaltz, itcrash-lands in shame; director Steven Brill doesn't prove that heknows the first thing about legitimate human emotions. To be fair,he's just as lost in the woods on how to make a comedy with laughs.""Without a Paddle"" is destined to be forgotten by the public in amatter of weeks, and it's just as well. ",Without A Paddle,PG-13,2004,2
961,"The author of this review is supposed to worship, or atleast respect Mike Nichols as one of the great Americanfilmmakers, but he can't. Although I never saw anythingparticularly wrong in Mike Nichols' films - they all hadinteresting stories, good cast etc. - I still haveimpression of watching them being equal to the watchingpaint dry. So, when even when he tried to make somethingdifferent with WOLF, his 1994 horror film, I greeted thateffort without any sort of enthusiasm.  The protagonist of this film is Will Randall (played by JackNicholson), publishing executive from New York who iscurrently experiencing plenty of disappointments in hislife. His firm is taken over by business tycoon RaymondAlden (played by Christopher Plummer) who degrades Randalland brings Stewart Swinton (played by James Spader),treacherous yuppie and Randall's former friend to his oldposition. To make things even worse, Randall's wifeCharlotte (played by Kate Nelligan) is having an affair.However, few days before this all happened, Randall wasbitten by a wolf on the isolated country road. Since thatevent he notices changes in his metabolism and life patterns- he sleeps all day and is awake all night, his senses arebetter, but the most significant change is willingness tostand up against his enemies. He becomes even more aware ofthis change when he meets Alden's daughter Laura (played byMichelle Pfeiffer) and begins an affair with her.  Some of the best roles in Jack Nicholson's career were thoseof men whose willingness to break the rules or succumb toirrational urges made them look satanic compared to ""normal""people. So, the role of book editor who is slowly turninginto werewolf was perfect for Nicholson and he plays it withgusto. Michelle Pfeiffer as his partner is also great andvisually more appealing than in many other movies. The castin this film is truly up to task, and Indian actor Om Purimakes quite an impression in the small episodic role oflycantropy expert. Nichols puts a lot of effort intoproduction design and other details, trying to make thestory about lycathropy in New York publishing circles asrealistic as possible, using the classic horror scenario asthe basis for interesting, thought-provoking drama aboutinter-office politics, midlife crisis and eternal strugglebetween civilisation and irrational urges in individualhumans.  Unfortunately, all those elements go down the drain whenNichols decides to wrap the story up with cheap horrorcliches and even cheaper murder subplots. The ending is notthe only problem of the film; Nichols, as usual, hasproblems with proper pace of the film. Slow-motion shots ofNicholson as werewolf are overlong, and Ennio Morricone'sscore is again quite irritating. So, like in many similarcases, my skepticism about Mike Nichols' film was justified.WOLF could be recommended only to those who truly enjoyNicholson's acting, even when the rest of the film isn'tquite worthy of his talent. ",Wolf,R,1994,2
962,"   Spanish star Penelope Cruz is as intoxicating as Brazilianbossa-nova rhythms in Fina Torres's wannabe ""Like Water for Chocolate""that also uses cooking as a metaphor for passionate romance. AsIsabella, she's both cursed and blessed. She's cursed with severemotion sickness that forces her to be ""in control"" of her movement -driving, dancing and being on top when she makes love. Yet she'sblessed with culinary genius, working as chef in a small seasiderestaurant owned by her mucho-macho musician husband, Toninho (MuriloBenicio). But when she catches him in bed with another woman, sheflees Bahia, seeking solace with her childhood friend, a transvestite(Harold Perrineau, Jr.) in San Francisco, where she's ""discovered"" bya TV producer (Mark Feuerstein) and becomes the sultry star of a localcooking show. Meanwhile, despondent Toninho is determined to win herback. So much for story. It's charismatic Penelope Cruz thatfascinates. Curiously, she's not a traditional beauty; her thin noseis far too long. But she's stunning, radiant and utterly compelling,particularly when she sways to Luis Bacalov's Latino score. On theother hand, Vera Blasi's flimsy plot goes beyond disbelief, needingfar too much voice-over narration. And Fina Torres' clumsy attempt atmagical realism cannot compare with Alfonso Arau (""Like Water ForChocolate""), even with Thierry Arbogast's caressingcinematography. Aside from Murilo Benicio's realization that, withouthis wife, his life is barren, there is no characterdevelopment. Harold Perrineau Jr. serves as comic relief, and MarkFeuerstein's fumbling ineptitude grows cloying quickly. On the GrangerMovie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Woman on Top"" is a frothy, sensuous 6, asephemeral and enchanting as the aromas that waft from Isabella'scuisine. ",Woman On Top,R,2000,2
963,"Here is a film which does what few Hollywood films would try to do;depict the life of an old person  in a way which seems realistic. I've seen the Grumpy Old Men movies, I've watched The Golden Girls,but they are nothing like A Woman's Tale, which tries to give us theunvarnished, and, if you may, wrinkled truth. The film was directed by Paul Cox, an Australian known for film suchas Lonely Hearts and Man of Flowers.  This movie is much like thebits of those other films (A Woman's Tale is the only one I've seenall the way through) -- it's slow, quiet and filled with warm and real moments. The woman is named Martha -- she is about 80 years old, and has cancerof the lung, due to years of smoking that she isn't willing to giveup.  She lives in an apartment by herself, paid for by her son, whodoesn't really approve of such an old person being on her own.  Anurse, hired by her son, visits and checks up on her, but it's obviousthat they are as much friends as nurse and patient.  They get alongso well, in fact, that Martha allows her to carry on an adulterousaffair with a married man in  her flat while she's out (the nurse,too, is married).  Martha herself is pretty much independent otherwise;she stays alone in her apartment at night, with only her cat and herparakeet to keep her company, and she does the usual things that otherseniors seem to do a lot, like hang out at the park with another oldfriend, and go to the usual social gatherings of other seniors (oneshot is of her and a bunch of other old people singing songs at whatappears to be the nearby old age home).  Martha is getting old, but she is not ready to give up just yet, evenwith the lung cancer that will take her life more sooner than later. In simple ways, she feels naturally justified to live her life asshe chooses, as in a funny moment when she, accompanying the nurseand her boyfriend at a restaurant, lights up, even though it's a non-smokingestablishment.  She says that she loves smoking and that it neverreally hurt her all of these years, so why should it hurt anybodyelse.  Then she points out that ""tea, it kills you; coffee kills you"" and points to the complaining manager that stress kills too.. Goodpoints all, although in this politically correct, anti-smoking age,where smokers are painted in an only less harsher light than thatof anthrax-laced letters, I doubt that too many people in authoritywould let her comments go by lightly.   In stronger ways, she haslived so long and seen so many good and bad things that she wondershow anyone else could want to give up life.  There's a great momentwhen she is listening to an all-night call in show (sort of like TalkRadio's Barry Champlain as a nice sensitive guy), and listens to asuicidal sixteen year old, whose boyfriend committed suicide, andwho believes that there is nobody out there who cares for her.  Marthais so moved that she calls up the show to speak to the girl herself,pleading with her not to do anything rash.of course Martha's hopesare not answered, since such a teenager as the caller is not matureenough to understand that life is to be lived, that life is all aboutups and downs, and that just because a bad thing has happened doesn'tmean that life is over, or useless.  Only someone of Martha's ageand mindset would appreciate such facts. It's interesting that Martha's son would believe that Martha is incapableof taking care of herself, as if she is some sort of invalid, becauseit's clear in many ways that Martha is able to take care of others,or at least try to make them happy.  She obviously does her best withthe suicidal caller, although it would probably work better if thetwo weren't strangers.  She is able to protect the fooling aroundof the nurse and her lover, and make them feel as if they are in asafe place.  And she also takes care of the man next door.  The man'sname is Billy, and he too is a senior, and it is safe to say thathe is far more gone than Martha could ever be; Billy was a formermember of the military, but is now a senile old man. I wonder myselfif perhaps he was shell-shocked from the war, and never fully recovered,or maybe he just naturally became the way he is; in any case, he isa lost man.  He doesn't take care of himself, hygiene-wise, and wandersabout the house and outside, sometimes locking himself out, or losingthings.  He also mostly speaks in a whisper.  Somebody has to watchhim, and Martha does that often. I have to smile at the whole moral conundrum that is her tolerancefor the adultery in her apartment.  I guess I find it a bit odd thatsomeone who professes to love life would approve of something thatis rather destructive in the long term.  Surer, there seems to bea thrill involved, but what about the unknowing partners (who arenever seen)?  Or.. (as we get clich_d here) what about the children???? Martha says a few times that she likes to see these two people happy,and even jokes about how envious she is...she seems to view them asembodiments of something she might have had earlier in life.  Nothaving anything to do with adultery, most likely, but with young love,beauty and passion.  She doesn't focus on the damaging aspects ofthis affair.  But then again, she's been smoking for 60 years andpushes away the harmful aspects of that too, so it's not as if shethinks ahead.  But that's okay..it's interesting to see an old personjust act like a regular person, even! while obviously at the end of her life.  She is someone who just wants to live life. A Woman's Tale is certainly a good intro to Paul Cox the director,as well as a showcase for the old lady who plays Martha.  I enjoyedcertain portions of the film, and I bet if I watched it again, I'dlike it more, as I'd be able to better understand and know the characters.  The movie doesn't have a lot of plot, but it does have somethingwhich is probably even more unique, which is an honest examinationof an old person's life.  Instead of treating the fact of old ageas a quirk or an excuse to create a sitcom, it merely shows an oldperson just being a person, and facing issues that all of us willinevitably face when we are 80 years old.","Woman's Tale, A",PG-13,1992,3.5
964,"The pressure's on Curtis Hanson directing his first pictureafter the highly acclaimed L.A. Confidential. Adapted by Steve Klovesfrom Michael Chabon's 1995 novel, the theme here revolves around amiddle-aged author who is creatively paralyzed after having publisheda successful novel seven years ago. Although it is not explained inthe movie, a 'wonder boy' is someone who has experienced great successearly in life and then has to face the fear and insecurity of livingup to himself.  Michael Douglas plays the cynical, dissolute collegeprofessor who cannot finish the manuscript for his next book - whichnow numbers more than 2,500 single-spaced typewritten pages - as hespends a picaresque ""Wordfest"" weekend frantically juggling his newlypregnant mistress, a suicidal student, his visiting editor, the corpseof a dead dog, and a fur-trimmed jacket that once belonged to MarilynMonroe.  Frances McDormand is his romantic interest; she's the collegechancellor who's married to the head of the English department. TobeyMaguire is a gifted but deeply troubled writing student who catchesthe eye of Robert Downey, as Douglas's flamboyant editor from NewYork.  Katie Holmes is a seductive young student with a crush onDouglas, and Rip Torn is successful, self-satisfied pop-culturewriter. Set in wintry western Pennsylvania - superbly photographed byDante Spinotti - it's a screwball, character-driven story whoseeclectic inhabitants are wacky, weird and whimsical. And the memorablesoundtrack includes Bob Dylan's new song, ""Things Have Changed.""

A sad alcoholic, he visits most of the bars along the way. Although his mental state leaves a lot to be desired, at least he is no wackolike Dulcie (Julianne Moore from HANNIBAL), a passed out drunk that he rescuesfrom one of his many watering holes.  But, like most of the people he meets, shedoesn't stay with him long.    Crudup and Moore's acting is okay, but Bart Freundlich's script and directionfor WORLD TRAVELER is as aimless as Cal's journey.  Not only does Freundlichgive us little reason to care about his story, it doesn't even give us muchmotivation to stay awake.  As a diner waitress named Delores, Karen Allen plays another of the strangersthat Cal encounters.  Four-time divorcee Delores tells us, ""I've come to thinkof men as a temporary state of mind,"" and soon thereafter disappears permanentlyfrom the story like one of the many telephone poles that pass by Cal's car.  The only interesting parts of WORLD TRAVELER are the lovely, snow-dottedlandscapes of America's heartland in winter and the same set of honky-tonk tunesplayed in each of the bars.  ""I can hardly make sense of it,"" Cal tells a bartender during one of his manyrambling, pointless conversations.

966,"Taking its cue from such down-and-dirty '70s horror films as 1974's""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and 1977's ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""WrongTurn"" is a grisly, effective little number that wisely does not bogitself down with needlessly overplotted exposition and last-minutestory twists. If it does not as closely capture the look and feelof those aforementioned cult classics the way 2003's ""House of 1000Corpses"" did, it is still a tense and frightful good time. Tautlydirected by Rob Schmidt (2000's ""Crime and Punishment in Suburbia"")and written with clear knowledge of the backwoods slasher genre byAlan McElroy (2002's ""Ecks vs. Sever""), ""Wrong Turn"" is simple, straightforward,and reaches squarely for the jugular of all horror fans. All others need not apply. On his way to Raleigh, N.C., for a job interview, Chris Finn (DesmondHarrington) gets stuck in backed-up highway traffic and opts to getaround it by taking the West Virginia backroads. Before he can makeit back to the highway, he accidentally hits a van carrying a groupof would-be campers--engaged lovebirds Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui)and Scott (Jeremy Sisto), couple Francine (Lindy Booth) and Evan (KevinZegers), and Jessie (Eliza Dushku), who is just getting over a relationship.With their van's tires flat after having run over barbed wire andChris' car totaled, Chris, Jessie, Carly, and Scott go to find a phone.Unfortunately, the first house they come upon--a ramshackle cabinin the middle of the wilderness--belongs to three grotesquely deformed inbred cannibals. Once the twentysomething friends come face-to-face with their worstnightmare at the 30-minute mark, ""Wrong Turn"" segues from its shakyfirst act into a fast and scary nonstop chase picture reminiscentof 2001's ""Jeepers Creepers."" As the six characters run for theirlives and are whittled down one-by-one by the deranged backwoods clan,director Rob Schmidt does an admirable job in escalating the suspenseto an occasionally almost unbearable altitude. A setpiece involvinga looming watchtower and a daring escape across tree branches at least100 feet in the air is easily the film's high point, ingeniously constructedand edited. The sudden slaughter of one of the main characters inthis sequence is imaginative, gruesome, and even a little poignant--rarefor a horror movie that keeps its character development at a decided minimum. Schmidt also knows just how to handle his three villains, keepingthem in the shadows enough so that when they are finally seen moreclearly, their visceral effect on the viewer is heavily palpable.Kudos to producer Stan Winston's perfectly chilling makeup effects,which are gruesome and frightening without being too exaggerated.Other technical credits are top-notch, with the detailed productiondesign by Alicia Keywan (1998's ""Bride of Chucky""); gritty and atmosphericcinematography of the Ontario wilderness (posing as West Virginia)by John S. Bartley (2002's ""Eight Legged Freaks""); and memorable musicscore by Elia Cmiral (2002's ""They"") standing out. The cast, made up mostly of rising young actors like Eliza Dushku(2002's ""City by the Sea"" and TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), DesmondHarrington (2002's ""Ghost Ship""), Emmanuelle Chriqui (2001's ""On theLine""), and Jeremy Sisto (2001's ""Angel Eyes"" and TV's ""Six Feet Under"")do their jobs professionally and with little fault outside of theirlack of depth. To be fair, if you were being chased by three hillbillycannibals, there probably wouldn't be too many chances for intimatescenes of character-building. Watching the extreme physical demandsthe actors have to go through is almost wrenching; the shoot was clearlynot an easy one, and it shows. With the recent release of Rob Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"" andnow ""Wrong Turn,"" it is refreshing to see a clear turn in the horrorgenre away from the self-referential likes of ""Scream""-style effortsand back to the sort of grimy, realistic, bloody, no-holds-barredhorror flicks of the '70s and early-'80s. Save for one reference to1972's ""Deliverance,"" ""Wrong Turn"" takes itself and the horrific situationit puts its characters in seriously. Even when the film occasionallydoes not pay off as well as it should have (as in the slightly disappointingand too-short climax), one has to still admire the makers for whatthey set out to do. And more often than not, director Rob Schmidtdoes it very well. Perhaps the most resounding endorsement of ""WrongTurn"" would be to say, after viewing it, I'm most certainly not goingto be taking any road trips on the backroads of West Virginia anytimesoon. Suffice to say, camping and nature hikes through the woods are out of the question.",Wrong Turn,R,2003,2
967,"More or less pre-sold as a ""James Bond""-inspired franchise for the21st century, there are both similarities and differences in ""XXX""to the debonair spy who likes his drinks shaken, not stirred. Whileboth are smooth with the ladies and out to save the world from a megalomaniac,Xander Cage (Vin Diesel) is younger, tougher, buffer, and tattooed.The action sequences he is involved in, while perhaps no more elaboratethan Bond's, are decidedly more death-defying. ""XXX,"" pronounced ""Triple-X,"" is the type of motion picture for whichthe term, ""leave your brain at the door,"" was invented for in moviegoer-speak.If you go into the film expecting a masterpiece of nuances and subtlety,believability, logic, and invigorating character interactions anddialogue, then you are most definitely barking up the wrong tree.Directed by Rob Cohen (who at least played a part in shooting actorVin Diesel to fame in 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious""), ""XXX"" isan eager-to-please thrill ride so loud, fast, and high-throttle thatif the theater auditorium walls fail to shake, the volume must beturned off. Intended as nothing more than a mindless entertainment,""XXX"" succeeds on the sole basis of getting the heart pumping as onemasterfully rendered, if hilariously over-the-top, action set-pieceafter the next is carried out. As the movie starts, Xander Cage is an extreme sportsman in troublewith the law. Instead of getting arrested, however, he is electedby NSA Agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) to become a secret agentand infiltrate a dangerous organization biding their time in Prague.Once there, Xander discovers that this group of men, known as the""Anarchy 99,"" are planning to put into action the deadly ""Silent Night""biological weapon on several countries of the world. He is aided inhis quest by the sultry Yelena (Asia Argento), whom he isn't quitesure is on his side or not.  From the very beginning, ""XXX"" is a complete mess of illogical storythreads and giant plot holes (if ""Anarchy 99"" is planning to blowup Prague, wouldn't they be wiping out their own country and theirvery existence?). Likewise, the dialogue, from a screenplay writtenby Rich Wilkes, is shamelessly cornball, with a bevy of one-linersmeant to evoke laughs but that only elicit groans. The deliriouslymaniacal villains, headed by the slimy Yorgi (Marton Csokas), area stock group of cartoonish lunatics, but manage to be somewhat memorable.In almost any other movie, these debits would be a cinematic kissof death. Because ""XXX"" is not supposed to be high art, or even makethat much sense, they can be reasonably overlooked. What really matters in a film of this genre is how impressive theaction scenes are, and director Rob Cohen and his group of stuntmenhave frankly outdone themselves. From a fiery, bullet-flying helicopter/motorcyclechase, to a bungee-jumping trip off a bridge in a car, to a meticulouslyfilmed and awe-inspiring avalanche sequence that has to be seen tobe believed, ""XXX"" is that rare action film that satisfies becauseit gets its key ingredient down just right. The avalanche scene, inparticular, may have some viewers audibly gasping and holding ontotheir armrests in excitement. The climax--a chase to reach the speeding,waterborne biological weapon before it detonates--ends on a hair-raisingenough note to make the film worth seeing for fans of this type of thing. There is a reason that the muscular, head-shaven, baritone-voicedVin Diesel (2001's ""The Fast and the Furious"") is fast becoming asuperstar. As proven by his self-directed 1994 short film, ""Multi-Facial,""1998's ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and 2000's ""Boiler Room,"" Diesel isa charismatic performer who has the acting chops of a pro, but healso has the presence and physical build of an action hero. Regrettably,Diesel doesn't get much of a chance to act in ""XXX,"" but he more thanholds his own as the star attraction of the film. As the tough andbeautiful Yelena, Asia Argento (daughter of Italian horror filmmakerDario Argento) matches Diesel beat for beat as a heroine with brainsand brawn. Less victorious is Samuel L. Jackson (2002's ""ChangingLanes""), strictly taking his paycheck and running in the throwawaypart of the facially scarred Agent Gibbons. When ""XXX"" finally stops long enough for some exposition, as it mustinevitably do, the movie crashes and burns with poorly conceived writingthat a third-grader could see right through. Luckily, director RobCohen realizes that the action is what audience members are comingto see, so he never lingers long enough for the movie to grow monotonous.""XXX"" is dumb and it's trashy, but there are obviously more adventuresfor Xander Cage to go on in the future (a sequel is already in theplanning stages). On the evidence of this technically exhilaratingfirst film, such a notion really doesn't seem like such a bad idea, after all. ",XXX,PG-13,2002,3
968,"THE YARDS, by director James Gray (LITTLE ODESSA), is a keenly observantfilm about a pair of two-bit hoods who accidentally get in way over theirheads.  The charismatic but foolish criminals, Leo Handler and WillieGutierrez, are played masterfully by Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix.Reminiscent of a gritty 1950s crime drama, the quiet film is a poignantcharacter study of smoldering intensity that could easily have starred ayoung Marlon Brando and James Dean. Just out of prison for stealing cars, Leo, with his soulful, downcast eyes,just wants to keep his nose clean.  The movie's central, tragic figure, Leoneeds a job to help his poor and ailing mother (Ellen Burstyn).  Turning forhelp to a relative, Leo visits his uncle, Frank Olchin, who runs a largerepair facility that specializes in fixing New York City transit trains andbuses.  A corrupt businessman but caring family man, Frank is played in asweetly nuanced performance by James Caan, last seen, impressively, as anaging crook in THE WAY OF THE GUN. Frank wants Leo to learn a trade and become a union machinist, but Leo isn'twilling to live off of hand-outs from Frank until he finishes his training.Instead, Leo wants to ""work with the suits"" like his old buddy Willie does.Willie, you see, specializes in greasing palms to land and keep lucrativecity contracts for Frank.  Frank's wife (Faye Dunaway) likes this idea, asdoes his step-daughter (Charlize Theron), who is close to being engaged toWillie. Besides dispensing graft, Willie is also in charge of a band of hooliganswho destroy the competition's handiwork.  When Willie and Leo are on one ofthese search-and-destroy missions at ""the (rail) yards"" in Queens, things gobadly awry, and someone dies.  This taxes Frank's legendary ability tocontrol situations.  It may be something that even he can't cover up. If the script, by James Gray and Matt Reeves, has a problem, it is that somuch effort has gone into preparing three juicy roles for Leo, Willie andFrank that the other parts don't have much to do other than provide filler.But that's a minor quibble for this simple story of great power.  The music,including ""Saturn"" from Gustav Holst's ""The Planets,"" reinforces but doesn'toverwhelm the solemnity of the drama. The best part of the production is Harris Savides's warmly intimatecinematography that is lit with light that seems to come from smallincandescent bulbs filtered through old, yellowed lamp shades.   Shot inshadows through door slits and frequently from a distance, he makes usobservers of the action rather than participants. The journey is the reward in this somber, cautionary tale.  Wahlberg'ssympathetic portrayal of an unlucky loser is probably the best work that hehas ever done.  But almost everything about the movie is an exception.  Inan era in which Quentin Tarantino's influence means that films usually optfor maximum violence, THE YARDS has remarkably little, concentrating itsenergy, instead, on a perceptive examination of the characters, not theaction.   THE YARDS runs 1:55.  It is rated R for language, violence and a scene ofsexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers.","Yards, The",R,2000,3.5
969,"Some people would hardly believe it, but in the early 1980sOliver Stone was regarded as anything but left-wing. Hisscripts were often being accused of promoting ethnicstereotypes, sexism, and in the case of CONAN THE BARBARIAN,even the most questionable right-wing agenda. One of suchexamples is YEAR OF THE DRAGON, now almost forgotten 1985gangster epic by Michael Cimino, the very first film thatmisfortunate director made after his HEAVEN'S GATE fiasco.That movie is now almost forgotten, but in its time it madea serious brouhaha with its alleged racism towards ChineseAmerican community. Naturally, it was Oliver Stone with hisscreenplay who was named the biggest culprit. On the otherhand, very few people then actually bothered to judge thisfilm on its cinematic merit, instead of cheap daytimepolitics. As soon as THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON went out of therelease, it was forgotten, despite being one of the moreambitious and interesting films of the previous decade.  The movie begins in New York, whose quiet and picturesqueChinatown gets shocked by the assassination of its top Triadboss. Following his death, the citizens of Chinatown andneighbouring quarters become targets of a whole series ofviolent incidents. On the surface, it looks like aescalation of youth gang activity; however, all thoseattacks are actually part of campaign, cleverly orchestratedby Joey Tai (John Lone), young Triad boss who wants toremove the old guard and become the undisputed leaderhimself. Unfortunately for Joey, he is not the onlyambitious man who wants to break the well-established rulesof his community. Captain Stanley White (Mickey Rourke),most decorated policeman in New York, is put in charge ofChinatown. His Vietnam traumas and hatred towards Asianpeople drives him to start relentless anti-crime crusadewith total disregard towards the law and unofficial pactbetween the police and local community leaders. That bringshim in an unavoidable conflict with Joey, which would resultin even more bloodbath.  Critics who accuse Cimino and Stone of anti-Asian racism aremissing the point, because the way Chinese community isportrayed in YEAR OF THE DRAGON isn't much different fromthe way some other ethnic or racial communities of Americaused to be portrayed in crime thrillers. For example, thesedays hardly any Italian American would be offended by theway Mafia is dealt by Hollywood. Cimino's sin was probablyin the fact that he was one of the first directors who usedto dig behind the surface and expose the problem. Even more,YEAR OF THE DRAGON didn't just try to show all the sinisterreality of crime-ridden Chinese community and its share ofthe evil that lurks on American street. It actually tried toexplain that the Chinese themselves are the greatest victimsof their crime lords, and even went further. The root of theproblem, according to the characters in the movie, doesn'tlie within the community itself; the self-isolation whichgave the crime organisations so much power is the directresult of the racism. When the Asian people get shunned andhumiliated and denied their fair share of American dream,they have no other choices but to turn to themselves and theold ways, however bad it could be. So, YEAR OF THE DRAGON isbasically the anti-racist film.  The anti-racist message was, however, blurred by the heavyuse of some police film clich‰s. Like in the 1970s, the heroand chief villain are presented like a total visualopposites of their character alignment. The ""good"" cop ispresented like a racist, wife- cheating redneck pig, who isready to sacrifice not just himself, but also his friends,family and colleagues in his personal, and very questionablewar; Mickey Rourke in one of the strongest performances ofhis career even gives him some traces of psychosis. The mainvillain, played by John Lone, on the other hand is handsome,cultivated, charismatic man, who actually cares both for hisfamily and is shown as person capable of compassionatedeeds; Stone's script even goes even further and gives JoeyTai opportunity to present himself as a leader whosebusiness-like philosophy might even signal the break withthe old tradition and bring his people from the isolation.  Unfortunately, if the movie concentrated on those twocharacters only, YEAR OF THE DRAGON would be remembered asthought-provoking epic worthy of GODFATHER. But it wasn'tmeant to be - in order to make Stanley White definitelylikeable, out of blue comes the character of Tracy Tzu,Chinese American TV reporter whose father somehow managed toearn fortune in honest way and integrate her daughter intoAmerican way of life. For some undetermined reason, StanleyWhite gets attracted to her and begins questioning his ownracist beliefs. Although that would make his character moresympathetic, his metamorphosys doesn't get properlyexplained, most probably due to the incredibly inept (and""Razzie"" awarded) performance of Arianne as his loveinterest. Things get even more complicated, when thecharacter of Stanley's long suffering wife Connie (CarolineKava, one of the most underused actresses in today'sHollywood) gets overexposure, together with unnecessary andtoo direct allusions to Stanley's own immigrant background.  All those many subplots are, on the other hand, excellentopportunity for Cimino to make another film of epicproportions. High budget, today almost unimaginable for themovies that deal with simple ""cops and robbers"" stories,gave an excellent opportunities for many delicate massscenes that Cimino likes so much. Some of them - like ameeting with drug-producing rebels in the hills of Burma,funerals, complicated shootouts in public places - areimpressive and would remain long in the the viewer's memory.Unfortunately, Cimino didn't care much of the script, andsome of those scenes, including many unnecessary subplotsand scenes involving side characters, slow the pace of themovie significantly. The uninspiring musical score by DavidMansfield is often used on the wrong places and because ofit, YEAR OF THE DRAGON sometimes look like a incoherentcombination of many different movies. However, despite allthose faults, and also because such movies would be hard tomake these days, YEAR OF THE DRAGON remains one of thoserare Hollywood products - unusual and thought-provokingfilms. ",Year Of The Dragon,R,1985,2
970,"  If you enjoy literate, intimate dramas, rich in texture, thisis the film for you. In a small, rural town in upstate New York, apetulant, irritable but good-hearted stoner/drifter (Mark Ruffalo) comeshome to borrow money from his church-going sister (Laura Linney), asingle mother with an eight year-old son (Rory Culkin).  Their parentswere killed in a car crash when she was a teenager, so she virtuallyraised her younger brother. Writer Kenneth Lonergan (""Analyze This,""""Rocky & Bullwinkle""), making his directorial debut, is less concernedwith plot than with his theme of trust and his complex characters,particularly their dialogue. Their words are an awkward condensationof how they feel and what they think they should feel, what they shouldsay. That's what subtext is all about. And Lonergan's meticulous careincludes the supporting roles: Jon Tenney as the sister's occasionalbeau and Matthew Broderick as her bullying new boss at the bank, anuptight, married man with whom she has a disastrous affair. You canspot the perceptive Lonergan himself as the laid-back pastor who asks,""Do you feel your life is important?"" Eventually, of course, bothsiblings must re-evaluate their lives and their relationships. MarkRuffalo and Laura Linney deliver subtle, terrific performances, as dothe rest of the cast except, perhaps, Matthew Broderick who resorts torigidity. Using Loretta Lynn's ""The Other Woman,"" amidst Lesley Barber'sclassical music, is a delicious touch. My only quibble is that, visually,it's slow-moving, resembling a play that was filmed. On the GrangerMovie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""You Can Count on Me"" is a multi-layered,melancholy 9,  both challenging and intriguing for mature moviegoers. ",You Can Count on Me,R,2000,3.5
971,"An 8 MILE wannabe, Chris Stokes's YOU GOT SERVED follows the world ofcompetitive street dancing (think break dancing).  During the ten percent ofthe movie when the actors are dancing to loud, ear shattering music, the moviecomes briefly into its own.  The dancing is so repetitive -- and the editing sooverdone -- that it can't sustain much more than a few music videos' worth oftime so the movie has to be padded out.  And I do mean padded.  Unlike 8 MILE, which has something to say when it isn't rapping, YOU GOT SERVEDfalls back on a very tired story line that is a mixture of a lame sitcom and aclich‰d melodrama.  It is one of the most forgettable scripts in some time,filled with recycled lines such as, ""Ouch girl, he's hot,"" and ""It's about morethan the money.""        The dancers have talent, rhythm and energy, but, when the movie isn't dancing,it's dead.  When one character said ""We need to end this now!"" I felt likestanding up and applauding wildly.    The movie does have one unintentional joke.  The formulaic film ends, ofcourse, in a big competition between rival groups.  The contest's name?  TheBig Bounce -- the same name as an even worse film than opens on the same day asYOU GOT SERVED.  With just three movies opening this week -- the perfectlyawful THE PERFECT SCORE is the third -- this week gets the worst marks in yearsfor the collective quality of the week's openings.  It makes you yearn for thegolden month of December when good movies come fast and furiously.  I recommendstrongly that you furiously avoid them all and stick to the Super Bowl.  Evenits commercials will be better than this week's films.  YOU GOT SERVED runs a very long 1:33.  The film is rated PG-13 for ""thematicelements and sexual references"" and would be acceptable for kids around 11 andup. ",You Got Served,PG-13,2004,1
972," ""You've Got Mail,"" the third showcase that has brought together the winning team of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (after 1990's odd-ball ""Joe Vs. the Volcano"" and 1993's charming ""Sleepless in Seattle""), obviously seemed like a no-brainer for director Nora Ephron and co-writer Delia Ephron since what they have basically made this time around is a ho-hum, mostly sloppy retread of many far more intelligent and witty romantic comedies.  Set in New York City, Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), for many years, has run her late mother's quaint children's bookstore called ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (which was the title of the original James Stewart picture, for which this film is based on). She has a writer boyfriend (Greg Kinnear), but has been recently sending honest and intimate e-mails over AOL to a man that she first met in an Over 30 chatroom, but they have decided to keep their identities anonymous. What Kathleen doesn't know is that her secret e-mail buddy is actually Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), who has his own hyper and giddy girlfriend (Parker Posey), and is about to open a more high-profile book store on the same street, threatening Kathleen's business. The gimmick for the film is that these two people have grown to love each other over the internet, even though they are feuding in real life.  ""You've Got Mail,"" is a sleek, well-photographed romantic comedy that actually compliments the beauty of NYC more than the actual stars of the film, since this story has been done far too many times before, and much better, at that. One of the biggest problems with the film is that there didn't appear to be any attempt to make an original film. No doubt, Ephron assumed that she had it made once she cast Hanks and Ryan, and so she forgot to add a quality screenplay. Watching the film, I didn't get any sense of excitement, urgency, or suspense involving the question of if Hanks and Ryan would get together at the end, since I knew for a fact that they would. Far too many times, I predicted dialogue and even what would occur in the next scene, and most of the time I was right on the mark. If an audience member can predict what the characters are going to say before they actually say it, then you know you're in trouble.  I will not criticize Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, since both of them have proved to be talented actors, and Ryan is simply too cute for words, but that is the exact problem. They are too good to be wasting their time in such a tried-and-true Hollywood formula. ""Sleepless in Seattle"" was also predictable, but that film was more sound and sharp in its writing and I cared about the characters more. Why not shake things up a bit and add a little creativity to the mix, instead of making what is basically an inferior remake to ""...Seattle?""  Rarely have I seen so many charasmatic supporting characters wasted so blatantly as they are in this movie. Greg Kinnear has the most chance of a developed character, but he disappears towards the middle and there is no mention of him again. Parker Posey, in her first notable role in a big-budget film, is punished with the emotionless ""bitch"" role, and is not even given one scene where she and Hanks simply talk. It's a shame Ephron decided to cast such a wonderful, fresh actress, only to throw her to the curb. Meanwhile, Dave Chappelle and Steve Zahn make no impression whatsoever with roles that might as well have been classified as extras.  Maybe I am making it sound like I hated ""You've Got Mail,"" which isn't the case. The film was never boring, but also never what I would consider entertaining. Basically, it just seemed to sit there, and it amazed me how little could be accomplished, even though the running time is overstretched to two hours. Hanks and Ryan, like always, have a great deal of chemistry together, and I liked their characters. I liked a few of the lines of dialogue (when Hanks enters a store, he introduces the two children he is with as his aunt and brother). The soundtrack of popular pop songs from the 70's, 80's, and 90's were fun to listen to. Everything seemed in place for a charming, and I was hoping, imaginative, romantic comedy, but to no avail. Nora Ephron may have hit the jackpot with ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" and I am also an admirer of her underrated 1994 comedy, ""Mixed Nuts,"" but ""You've Got Mail,"" ultimately, fails to add anything new or worthwhile into the now worn-out romantic comedy genre. ",You've Got Mail,PG,1998,3
973,"Making a movie that's stupid fun must be really hard since most filmmakersthat try end up with a picture that's merely stupid.  Rarely are they assuccessful as Ben Stiller is with ZOOLANDER, a film in which he is thedirector, star and co-writer.  The laughs come loud and often.  And therearen't any that will leave you embarrassed for succumbing to laughter.  Bothphysical and verbal, the jokes are not only silly but good-spirited as well,as the comedy pokes fun at the male modeling profession. In a story that redefines the meaning of shallowness to somethingapproaching the width of a light beam, the movie stars two dimwits, DerekZoolander (Stiller), three-time male model of the year, and Hansel (OwenWilson), his new competition.  Zoolander, who got the idea of being a modelduring his first time in second grade, is at the top of his form.  With hisfamous ""blue steel"" look, he's invincible.  Or maybe not.  Stiller,certainly is.  The speech pattern alone that he developed for the movie isworth the price of admission, and it's hard to figure out if he is better asa director, writer or star.  I suspect, however, that he could have gottenhis movie made a lot cheaper.  From production designer Robin Standefer tocostumer David C. Robinson, everyone associated with it clearly had so muchfun that they probably would have worked for nothing. And speaking of people who were probably paid just scale, the movie has along series of great cameos.  Watch for several when Zoolander goes brieflyto work with his family in the harsh environment of a southern New Jerseycoal mine.  My favorite cameo is David Duchovny's as the world's most famoushand model.  In an X Files setting, he meets Zoolander and his companion,Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), at night in a graveyard to warn ofunknown dangers. The plot involves an evil clothing manufacturer, Jacobim Mugatu (WillFerrell), who secretly turns male models into killing machines.  Most of themovie, however, concerns itself more with the life and times of male modelsthan with any dastardly deed.  ""Did you ever think that there was more tolife than being really, really, really good looking?""  Zoolander asks hisfellow male models in the story's recurring, rhetorical question.  He andhis buddies have a music video moment that proves too hot for them tohandle, but it does get them properly memorialized. Among the many excellent minor characters is Milla Jovovich playing aNatasha-like character called Katinka.  There really isn't a Borischaracter, but Ben's father, Jerry Stiller, does a nice job as Zoolander'sboss, Maury Ballstein.  Maury heads an organization called Ball Models.  Thejokes come so fast that it would probably take a couple of viewings to catchthem all.     Among many superb scenes, none outdoes the ""walk off.""  Like a couple ofteens from THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, Zoolander and Hansel go to a secretlocation to face off on a runway, where they challenge each other.  It's across between a boxing match and a drag race.  And like the rest of themovie, it's hilarious. ZOOLANDER runs just 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for ""sexual content and drugreferences"" and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up. My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave the film *** 1/2.  He found it really funny andquite creative.",Zoolander,PG-13,2001,3
